George Russell,"It means a huge amount. There are so many people back at the factory, in Brackley and Brixworth, who have worked so hard to achieve. It has been a really challenging season. I've let the side down a couple of times this year. So, pleased to bring it across the line today. It was tight with Checo at the end. I thought Charles was going to back me up but respect to him for keeping it clean…. and I can chill out now. I mean, I came out of the pits on a second set of Hards. I was managing a bit and then Checo just came from nowhere. So, I don't know what happened there. They had great pace. It was really tense at the end. The tyres were dropping off. But just really pleased to have secured P2 for the team. And I’m sure everyone will have a few drinks tonight. I was probably coughing four times a lap then, so it was pretty miserable out there, which didn't help things. But, as I said, just a massive relief to have brought the car home in P3. Can't believe it's only the second podium of the year, but really happy to end the season this way. Yeah, it was a great weekend. And I'm really pleased to finish on this high because it's been a really challenging season. One, as a team, but on a personal side, just not getting the results that we probably deserve. The pace has been really strong on so many occasions, but just results kept on slipping through our fingers. So, you know, lady luck maybe on our side slightly today with Checo’s penalty but I think that more than made up for the other races this year. Yeah, I’ve been really ill the last two weeks. Firstly, in Vegas with a big fever, I couldn't sleep and just felt awful. And then I've had a horrendous cough that stayed with me all week and in the car. I was coughing every single lap but when you're strapped into the car, you can't breathe. You can't take a deep breath in to get the cough out. So, it was just constantly with me. It was pretty, pretty miserable. So, I was pleased to bring it home when I saw that chequered flag. Yeah, I think we're taking a clean slate into next year's car. I think that the positive is we're not scratching our heads why we're so far behind Red Bull. We see so many flaws with this car, which gives every single person back at the factory so much motivation and fire to chase after those problems and find those solutions, which we think will make a good step into next year. But, of course, I expect Red Bull to make a step again. But I’ve got no doubt, come Bahrain, we’ll be in a stronger position than we were in Bahrain this year. I think the drivers, we have it best from every single person in this paddock, the way we travel. We're in a very fortunate position. But everybody up and down the paddock - I've got so many mechanics who are ill, people in the engineers’ office, just really struggling with the constant time zone shifts, the body not knowing where you are, eating at different times, staying in different hotels, different environments, different climates. The body's getting confused. I think there are talks for next year about personnel being regulated that they can't do every single race. I think that would be a good thing. I don't think it's sustainable to 4,000 people, I think it is, to do 24 races a season, especially when you see how geographically it still doesn't make a huge amount of sense.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"It's actually a sponsor. No, no, it was all in the last few minutes, because Checo had five seconds penalty. So we had to help him, in a way, for him to finish in front of George with the five seconds. I tried to give him the DRS and a slipstream. But unfortunately that wasn't enough. So, on one hand, I'm really happy because on a weekend like this, honestly, there wasn't one thing we could have done better as a team. I think it was definitely not a given that we were in the second fastest car this weekend. But we did an incredible job, doing everything right – strategy, qualifying. It's just a shame that we finished third in the Constructors’. That's all that mattered to me in this end of season. And we didn't achieve that. But yeah, anyway, I would like to thank the team for doing such incredible work and for working so incredibly hard since the first race. We knew that it was going to be an uphill season because we lacked performance compared to where we wanted. But the team has done an incredible job, pushing until the last race. Yeah, I obviously wanted to try and get that first place. But we also know that in the race, we lack some pace compared to them. So even if I would have passed Max there, I probably would have gotten overtaken again, three or four laps later. And at the end, my only target was to beat the Mercedes. So I didn't want to lose too much tyre juice and also time with Max. But yeah, it was fun. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hmmm… well, yeah, more or less, I think we were a bit more competitive than what we expected. I think we expect to be a bit on the backfoot compared to Mercedes or McLaren, but I guess, apart from that, everything was as expected. I mean, Max was stronger as expected but we had quite good tyre management. We were expected to struggle mostly with overheating. That is normally one of our weaknesses. But today we did quite a good job on that. Yeah, it was nice. On the other hand, obviously I had, in my mind, the Constructors' Championship, so I couldn't take too many risks. But as I said, I saw an opportunity, I saw that Max was looking in the mirrors where I was expecting him to look in the mirror, so I made him think that I was going to the right, then I went to the left and then I tried also in Turn 9 but I knew that it was important for me to take care of those tyres, and even in the first lap, everything is so sensitive here that even if you push too much in the first lap then this can have a huge consequence on the rest of your run. So, at one point I just decided to settle for the second place, which anyway if we will have got that first place, I don't think we'll have kept that for long. I mean, depends for what. On one hand it is good to finish a season like that. That gives me the confidence that, for next year, hopefully, we know more where we need to set-up our car and where the development needs to be done. On the other hand, there's still a long way to go before getting to the Red Bull pace, especially in terms of race pace. So, on that we are all aware in the team that there's still a lot of work to do. Depends where? Because there was so much going on. Yeah, it depends where we are. It's so much up and down. We've got races where we were definitely the second fastest cars, other races where maybe we were the fourth or fifth fastest car, so it was really up and down. But I believe that since Japan, when we brought an upgrade to the car, it went in the right direction, especially for my driving style. I always like to have a strong front and I felt much more at ease and could be much more consistent. So yeah, that's a positive. Then, of course, very disappointed with that third place in the Constructors’ as that was my only target since two or three races now. It was until the very last lap, I tried to give Checo the DRS for him to try and pull away five seconds to George, but that didn't quite work out. I think Max was saving quite a bit on the medium because there were two or three laps before he pitted where he started to push and then straight away I understood: OK, they've got maybe much more margin than what I initially thought. Then on the hard, it was mostly about managing the gap to George behind. I was aware that we couldn't go and fight with Max, so I didn't want to take too much out of the tyres in the first few laps to then push. And I was also still thinking about a one stop at that time, so I had to go to the end of the race. Maybe we didn’t optimise that stint  because then we went for another stop. So yeah, I think that's the reason why also the pace didn't seem to be as good. Oh, quite a few laps before; as soon as I was aware about the five seconds penalty, basically. Then I was asking constantly the gap between George and Checo. Then they told me that Checo had passed George, so I knew Checo was behind me and his best chance was obviously to get the DRS from me and try and pull away as much as possible from George. So I knew that there was quite a bit of discussion between my engineer and myself and I let him know as well that this was my plan but it didn't work out.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, an incredible season. It was a bit emotional on the in-lap. You know, it was the last time I was sitting in the car, which has of course given me a lot. So yeah, I’m of course very proud to win here at the last race. But I have to say a big thank you to everyone at Red Bull. It's just been an incredible year. It will be hard to do something similar again, but we definitely enjoyed this year. You taught me how to do it! Yeah it'll be very hard to have another season like this, we know that. Of course, you always want to do better, but sometimes doing better is not only race wins and eventually winning the championship but we'll see, you know. We are working hard for next year to have again a very competitive car. For sure, all the other teams out there want to try and beat us next year and we are ready for the battle. But in the meantime, we are going to enjoy a little bit this year as well. Yeah, it's been incredible you know, sold out in basically every place we went to. Great fan support and again, also here. I hope you guys enjoyed the race today as well and you saw all your favourite drivers do well. And, of course, thank you very much for cheering us on. Yeah, it was, of course, a good race. I mean, the first stint, I didn't really know what to expect, because I didn't do a long run. So I probably took it a bit too easy in the beginning, but I guess that was better than trying to push ahead and destroy the tyres. So I took a few laps. But then I also think the Medium was just not as good as expected. So then we had to pit, because I saw everyone around me also pitting and, you know, on the Hard tyres, everything felt a bit more normal, a bit more easy to manage with the temperatures and basically I could extend my lead lap after lap. And yeah, it was pretty straightforward. I think for not having done a long run, the car felt quite decent out there. No, of course, I mean, the first lap, you cannot take it easy. It was good. I think. Yeah, we raced well. I didn't expect Charles to go on the left into Turn 6 but it was a good move. But I think at the same time, of course, Charles also had to think about the Championship, you know, for the team. So yeah, it was good. I enjoyed that. Well, I knew it was on the cards, of course, going into the race. And also, from the engineering side with the strategy, we wanted to, of course, try and plan it in a way that I wouldn't pit too early. So, just wait for others to pit. Of course, to try and achieve that it was maybe not always the, let's say, the fastest strategy. But I wanted to stay in the lead, of course to get the laps in. I think the just the team spirit. Not so much the wins or the, whatever, poles or laps led, just the enjoyment we had as a team. Because, yeah, the wins are great, of course but I think it's also very important to have a good atmosphere in the team and have a lot of fun. And just the people you work with, there's a lot of smart people in the team. And I also know that whatever you do in motor racing, I think it never will top that. So yeah, just seeing everyone at work, trying to do the best they can every day, and give it all out there for you. Yeah, that's really nice to see. I do think that that is just how I grew up. I can't just come into a weekend not giving it all. I just get annoyed with myself and I know the people around me get annoyed with me if I would be like that. It doesn't really matter. My mindset also didn't change after winning the championship. I come to the race weekends and I of course always try to do the best I can. And it's nice. You know winning is great. Why would I not want to win when you have the opportunity to win? When I see that there is of course the opportunity to win, I will always try to do the best I can and also for the team. When you have such a good car, you want to try and extend certain records and do well. No, it was to try and lead for 1,000 laps in the season. I knew that that was on the cards. So I said to GP… he was also of course aware of that, so just to make sure that they wouldn't pit me too early. The tyres still felt OK. They were not fantastic but they felt OK at that point so we just kept on extending a little bit. Well, in general the car has been better than last year and we were very solid in terms of no retirements, no real issues on the car which of course is also a big key to that.  From my side, every single year I try to do better but I think better -  it's more about just general experience in F1 and trying to put the weekend together a bit more. Some weekends that works better than others. And then yeah, besides that, just try not to make too many mistakes. Try not to get too much damage on the car with the cost cap and stuff, these kinds of things which I think worked quite well. Oh, it's been that for a couple of years so it's nothing new. It's something that we are constantly working on but it's not easy to solve, let's say like that. It can be better but we try to do the best we can. It was a little bit better, yeah.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Difficult session, you know? It’s extremely tight this weekend. It’s been a bit of a messy one. Pace has been there, just a lot of mistakes and last-up I made a little bit of a mistake as well, but it would have been quite a last corner to get to the front. So, happy with that. The car is very quick this weekend. Nice turnaround from Vegas for us, but happy to be back in the top three. I think practice, the pace was there – just there were a couple of big mistakes in every lap. I think I went into qualifying and I hadn’t done a clean lap all weekend. So, yeah, made life a little bit more difficult for myself. Q1, messy, Q2, got it together, finally and yeah, it was pretty good in Q3. So, happy with that. Close but not quite close enough. Not a clue. I don’t know. For everyone, I think it’s going to be the same story. I think the most anyone’s done is probably five laps in a row this weekend. Going to be interested to see how everyone pans out tomorrow. Yeah, we’ll see. Yeah, definitely. I think we knew Vegas was going to be a bit of a struggle for us going into the weekend. I think we got a few things wrong in qualifying that made it seem worse than it actually was. But we knew here would be a lot better. You know, the pace has been good the whole weekend, I would say. It was a bit of a surprise for me just how tight everything was at the start of qualifying. I think it was like four tenths from first to 15th in Q1, so you couldn't afford to make a mistake but no, at the pointy end and nice to back in the top three. I don't know. We've been quick in sector one all weekend. That seems to just be our happy place around here. But yeah, everything else is a bit up and down. You know, Russell's been looking extremely quick in all of the practices and, you know, Max said he was struggling a bit. So it's been a bit hard to get a read on where everyone actually sits. But the normal stuff that we like, the medium-speed corners, the high-speed corners, that's where I think we're strongest. And the slow stuff is where we struggle a bit more. I mean, I like this place. I've got good memories around here. But yeah, I don't know what happened to Lando on the last lap. You know, I was struggling a little bit in the first two parts of quali, or certainly the first part, and yeah, I don't know. I do have good memories around here. I've just been struggling to get it together this weekend. I think before qualifying I hadn't done a lap without quite a major mistake this weekend. So I was struggling to get everything together. I think I did a much better job on that in qualifying, but I do like coming back here. I would say yesterday I was struggling a lot with six and seven, just pulling the car up well enough was a big challenge. I think today I got on top of that. I think also some of the changes we made with the car made it a bit more difficult in some places so today there's been a bit more random and mainly just from trying too hard. The pace in all the corners without mistakes has been good all weekend. Just when I've made a mistake it's not been a small one, it's been nearly a lap ending mistake.  So nice to tidy that up into qualifying, still a couple of moments that I wish I could have done a better job but no, all OK.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, but honestly, considering the weekend we’ve had until now, I did not expect it at all. The last lap, I knew I had to put absolutely everything together, and I did. The last corner was a bit too much sliding, but I think everybody had that. So, really, really happy with the second place. I mean, in Q1 and Q2 I was worried to go through, and at the end a front row. So, it’s amazing. Yeah, for some reason, our car is very peaky. So, whenever we’re on scrubbed tyres, like the first run in Q3 was a very good lap – but we were last and I didn’t have much hope. But then, when we put the new tyres, everything comes alive and it felt great and, again, I did a great lap, so really happy to be on the front row – but it’s a big surprise. Well, I hope it’s going to go well. That’s the target, to beat them in the Constructors’ Championship, so I really hope Carlos can have a great start and then join me in the fight. And let’s try and put both of our cars in front of both Mercedes and come back home with a second place in the Constructors’ that is all that matters to me this weekend. I said that last weekend, so last weekend felt like a really, really good lap, this quali felt like a really good lap as well. So yeah, it was a bit of a surprise this one, because Q1 and Q2 I was on the limit of making it through. I mean, not on the limit, but it was quite tight and I was actually worried to go through this Q1 and Q2 but then in Q3 I managed to put a good lap together and everything felt good, so I'm really happy with that, because I definitely did not expect to be on the front row this weekend. Considering how much we struggled, I mean FP2 was really good. But then FP1 and FP3… I didn't do FP1, but as a team, I think we struggled massively, so it's a good surprise. It's very, very strange. In FP3 everything felt really good but we were just super slow and it's a bit difficult as a driver to then pinpoint something, because you just have not enough grip to go faster and I think it confirms a little bit our whole season, where we have a very peaky car. Whenever we are in the right window, that's great. Whenever we fall out of that window a little bit then it has huge consequences. And today and this weekend overall has been like that. I don't know. But I mean the only thing that matters to me is that we challenge the Mercedes and that we take the second place in the Constructors’ because in the Drivers’, honestly finishing fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh in the Drivers’, I don't care. But second in the Constructors’ would be nice. So we just need to beat the Mercedes, but of course if there's an opportunity to beat Max tomorrow, I'll take it. However, on a track like this, with hot conditions like this, I expect us to struggle a bit more than Las Vegas, than what we've seen in Vegas on race pace. So, but let's see. We've been good with the tyre management in Vegas in very different conditions. In FP3, I had quite a good feeling during the race simulations, so I hope we can reproduce that tomorrow. Well, I don't know what the Mercedes is going to do. So I'll just focus on myself. And then we'll try to do the best race we can. And we'll see who gets a second place at the end of the of the weekend. Yeah, I like this track actually, especially the last sector is very technical. It's also very, very difficult to get it right in qualifying because it's such fine margins and as Max mentioned, it's very difficult to follow in those off-camber corners but at the same time, during qualifying, as soon as you get it wrong but even by five or 10 centimetres that has huge consequences, which I like it in qualifying but I agree with Max that for the race I don't think that's great because you  struggle a lot to follow in those corners. Yeah, I think it would be nice, it will definitely help racing. It's a track where there's already quite a lot of overtaking opportunities, but definitely that will make it even better. Yeah, that's what I meant before when I was saying our car is very picky because on the scrubbed tyres it was as scrub as the other drivers and I was behind everybody basically and then you put new tyres on the car, suddenly it becomes great and I was feeling much more at ease with the car and the lap came together nicely apart from the last corner where I have  overpushed but I think this is a tendency for everybody on this track. You arrive with very overheated tyres so I don't think there was much to gain anyway on that lap. But yeah, we've gained like crazy from scrubbed to new and much more than everybody else. I hope this is not a negative sign for tomorrow when we have to do long runs but I'm sure we will do a good job. Well, it's not been easy. I think we've had two parts of the season: we've had pre-Japan and post-Japan at least on my side. I feel much more at ease with the car since Japan.  We've worked on the consistency of the car in different conditions which helped a lot my driving style which… I like quite a lot to have an oversteery car and a strong front which in the first part of the season I couldn't quite do that. But yeah, there's still a lot of work to do obviously because especially into the race, with the tyres, everything depends on details that we need to get everything right and at the moment our car is not  good enough and not consistent enough, especially on long runs so we are working on that.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. Really weird. The whole weekend so far has been a bit of a struggle. So, we definitely improved the car for qualifying and, from lap 1, it all seemed a bit more together. And we could definitely push more. Of course, very happy to be on pole. Yeah, for sure. I mean, around here, already with the tyres, if you have little slides and whatever, it can cost you a lot of lap time. And that was what was happening for us in practice. But then, in qualifying, it all was a bit more connected. Yeah, well, let’s see. I have no clue how good we’re going to be in the race. Normally, we’re always quite decent but yeah, it’s been a very special season, and we’ve been enjoying it a lot, and, of course, we’re very proud of what we have achieved so far this year. Yeah. What a turnaround! Because in practice it was not looking that good. I was struggling a lot with the balance, so luckily I think we made the right changes on the car for Qualifying – because I think from lap 1 it all just felt a lot more connected and, around here, where it’s a lot about tyres, and how they behave, if you have tiny slides here and there, they overheat, so in Qualifying it definitely felt all-in a bit better. Yesterday, FP2, today, FP3 in the morning was all bad, so I don’t really think it had anything to do with that. You know, of course the track grips up a bit, but I think the issues I had were more severe than a little bit more rubber here and there. More in the race, to be honest. But sometimes, of course, in qualifying, we had some really good laps as well – but it definitely shows that it’s details that can make a massive difference, because today, I was not so happy up until qualifying and then in qualifying it turns into normal behaviour. Nice! I have no clue how the car will behave in the race. I have not really done any long running, so I guess we’ll find out throughout the race. But, I mean, so far, most of the races we have been quite strong. Tomorrow, I just have to ease myself into it, I guess. A little bit. It will help a little bit. But, of course, every year, your balance, or issues that you have to go faster, are a little bit different, so you can’t always relate fully to what you have done in the past. But it does help you understand a few things. Yeah, I just run out of front tyre. It was improving after the first sector and halfway through the second sector and then I don't know, it just went away from me a little bit. A bit more front locking, and then immediately the grip is gone. This track, well this track/tyre combination is extremely sensitive to that. And that's also what was happening to us in practice. And when you have these kind of like mini-lockups or slides, understeer, it can go away from you. I mean, it was still a good lap. I think it was still within a couple hundredths, but it was just going away from me in the middle of the lap to the end. Us drivers agreed to that in the briefing, to have that. Otherwise I think you would have seen again what happened yesterday. At the moment nothing is perfect yet, so we have to come up with a better solution but we'll keep on thinking about what that is. I, of course, always have my favourite tracks but I don't mind coming here, it's always very chilled. I guess that also has to do with the end of the year. Good temperatures, nice people. And then the track itself? I think the only thing I would like to change is just the off-camber corners. I think that doesn't really help the racing. Bit more banked corners would help, so around the hotel they need to bank that instead of off-camber. And was it turn seven at that little crest? It always throws you off a little bit and especially when you're behind, you just lose a lot of traction so that corner also just bank it a bit. That would help. Yeah, I'll give you the percentages. Just one second, I'm going to get my set-up sheet. No, it was just a bit more balance, it was just really unpredictable: oversteer, understeer. Then we tried to help the understeer, that became oversteer then we had oversteer, understeer and It just kept on changing a lot and around here you cannot have that, you can't have any sliding. So yeah, it was just not good to drive. It's just a difficult balance and luckily for qualifying it was pretty much gone. It was still a bit there, but we could drive around it a little bit. Well, first of all, I think Helmut learned his lesson: never bet against me. Of course it's always a bit of a gamble because you don't know. We already tried a lot of things on the car which didn't really seem to solve the problem. But I think GP  stayed calm and he definitely went through a lot of options. And then with my feedback, he came up with a very good set-up for qualifying. So yeah, of course very, very happy with that but of course it's always a bit of a gamble. You're never 100% sure, and missing a FP1, I don’t know, probably would have still been tough to get it right for FP2/FP3.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Daniel Ricciardo,"I was going to answer it not seriously, but I'll answer it seriously. We just missed a little bit. We took the weekend very seriously. No, there were no extracurricular reasons why we didn't perform. Now, we did some analysis post-race, a little bit more today. I think we know, let's say, the fundamental reasons or things that we maybe got wrong. But yeah, it was tricky. Obviously, it's a new track for everyone, it’s a street circuit. It was really the asphalt and the temperatures. I think that was obviously something that was a bit of a challenge, to get on top of it and to get the tyres working and in the right window. And that's ultimately where we struggled. So then, during the race, the race starts, the restarts, I felt like we were just sliding a little more than the others. And that put us on the backfoot a lot. Yeah, one does. I think it's more conventional. Again, hopefully that speed we showed in the triple-header can be put on display again, in a more standard circuit. Yeah, so I'm confident. Some metal in my hand. I think it's really just been… I think when I look back on this year, it's a year I never would have expected in so many ways. I didn't expect to be racing at all this year, let alone kind of going through everything else. So it's something that I'm definitely happy [about]. You know, the place I am and what I feel, let's say inside my heart ultimately, I'm really in a happy place, and I'm happy being here racing again. I'd say like, just fully hungry and motivated. And yeah, it's probably the first off-season that I would not really want an off-season, you know. I want to keep racing and keep a bit of the flow going. But also the thought of having a little bit of a break and getting myself prepared for next year, that excites me as well. I'd say tremendously. I think for the team, he's been everything, you know, obviously starting off in the Toro Rosso days, you know, that's where I started, or my first full season in F1. You know, I remember quite vividly the first meeting I had in his office and, you know, I kind of bounced in with a smile. And I think he looked at me like… Tried to prepare me for what's ahead. You know, it's a serious sport and it's a tough old world. So I think, yeah, he was very honest with me as well, but it made me… A little bit the same as with Helmut, it kind of made me mature a little quicker and ultimately grow up and I think Franz has always been really involved. You know, he's in every debrief, he'll normally speak as well in debriefs and give some analysis or advice or anything he's seen. He's fully involved in it. And it's his passion. It's been everything that's kind of given him drive for so many years. I hope he can enjoy putting his feet up a little bit next year. I'm not sure fully what that’s going to entail for him, but I really hope he's able to enjoy some R&R, but yeah, a lot of good memories and actually really nice for me personally to come back to the team and be here for his farewell. I think the good bits, I mean, certainly… I haven't watched the replay of the race. I saw highlights for sure and it sounded like it was a good race. And I think obviously not every street circuit is that easy to overtake. You know, it's a little bit follow-the-leader on some of them. So I think that was kind of refreshing to have that. I think maybe second highest overtakes of the year? I saw a stat, so that's good. I think everything was pretty cool. It's hard when you put on an event like that. Even getting to the circuit. I think that was the first day, driving to the track, not very far, but having to kind of go around the whole city you realise how much infrastructure and everything has been put in place to pull this thing off. So I think that's where I realised just how much of a big operation it is and it's pretty much impossible for something like that to go perfect on its first attempt. So yeah, I think I just had a lot of respect for the effort that was put into it. Obviously, Thursday was difficult. I think they recovered well, obviously no issues since then. So as long as Thursday was, and for sure there were some people who were a bit upset by it. I think they did well to, let's say, get themselves out of that situation and repair the track. And have you know, from that point, Friday and Saturday, a pretty flawless weekend. So yeah, I think it was positive. I think there will definitely be things to improve in the coming years. I think the schedule was one that we can all probably say was just a bit… That was the thing that I didn't love, was just the timings of it. I'm sure there's reasons for that. But if it could be earlier for sure, that would be nice. As it does get dark pretty early in November. Aw! You say something that you're like, ‘argh! , they're going to see me do, like, one talk show and be like: what are you doing?’ Yeah, I think it was… I've definitely cut back on a lot of things, let's say, outside of racing, for sure. I still have some other interests outside of the sport, which I'm involved in, and I enjoy, but I've minimised a lot. And I'm really just trying to, I think, make sure that… I think it always has been, but to obviously make the racing the priority. And, you know, if I've got, especially with the calendar now and the schedule, if I've got some time off, then I'm either in the gym, or I'm putting my feet up and recovering for the next race. So, I think yeah, just kind of prioritising a few things outside of this job. I think it's also… especially the way the sports growing, it's easy to get a little bit – I don't even want to say lost – but there's just so much going on. And there's so many things that you can be doing, and it's all really exciting and really fun, and I am…  I love that stuff, of course because it's obviously it's a new experience and it's great but I think probably having the time off for the start of the year I realised that I was probably just doing too much sometimes and probably even just not prioritising myself in terms of my body and my recovery and all that. So yeah, in a long way of saying it, just try to focus on that. It's hard when you don't take as many topless pics as George. I hope I answered that in a way that made sense but yeah, that's what I was getting at. Yeah, definitely. I think Kevin made… yeah, a lot of those feelings were felt for me as well. I think being away from it, yes, it's really that. It should be the coolest thing that we do, right? But when you've done it your whole life, and obviously, when you go through… when you're winning, it's kind of easy, but when you're not, obviously, you go through some other challenging moments where you can become a little bit frustrated with it. And then obviously, on a competitive side, your confidence takes a hit. So, then you're kind of asking yourself more questions. And then, I think that also makes you question the love for it, then maybe you're not as hungry and the other sides of the sport, in terms of preparation, and that and… yeah, I just, I think having the time off was, it gave me the answer of how much I do love it, ultimately. How much it means to me. And I think that's also where, coming into now, I feel like I got a second chance, a second wind, where it's like, okay, I want to make sure this is my one and only priority, I'm going to put all my energy into this. Because I just don't want to walk away one day and be like, ‘could have done more’ or, ‘that career slipped a little bit out of my fingers’. I'd hate to feel that. So, yeah, gave me a new perspective, which is really cool. I’d say I’d recommend it to everyone! I mean, obviously everyone's on their own kind of path but I can't believe how much I've enjoyed the second half the season. It's, it's pretty crazy what six months can do. I think yeah, obviously if I can prioritise my body like you prioritise your beard, then we're going to be in really good shape come Bahrain next year. I wish the camera would pan to you right now, in all its thickness and all its goodness! Look I feel…  I haven't done the whole season obviously, so yes I still feel a bit tired because you know actually the last few weeks, it's been pretty relentless, the schedule, but I've probably got a little bit of energy reserve in me, so I plan to have just a shorter bit of couch time over the break. I will go home to Australia, spend some time there, which I always love doing. But yeah, I think as opposed to maybe having two-and-a-half, three weeks of kind of off and enjoyment, I might just have one-and-a-half weeks, and then get back into the gym and enjoy it. So, I don't know what I'm talking about anymore. Are you laughing at me or something else? Well, I don't know…  one-and-a-half… it’s weird, isn't it? I should have just said 10 days. Anyway you're getting it. I'm going to do very well. We’re delirious! I guess this is answering Adam’s question earlier. Times are tough! Sub-optimal right now!",Abu Dhabi,thursday,RB
George Russell,"Yeah, we're excited for the challenge ahead. It's going to be a close fight with Ferrari. They're obviously coming off the back of a strong race, but definitely I’d prefer to be in the position we are in than in their shoes. And I think we just need to go out there, focus on ourselves, try and be as fast as possible. And if we do so, we'll finish ahead. They were definitely pretty competitive here last year. But we've been surprised a lot this season about which teams are fast at which races and vice versa. So we're going in with an open mind. Qualifying, I think, they'll have slightly the upper hand as they have tended to do so this season. But come Sunday, I think it'll be a different story and we'll have a good race. It's been a very, very strange season. It’s been a season where we've had a lot of pace at times, but never achieved the results that I felt were deserved, or were possible. So we definitely need to try and understand why that was. There's been a huge amount of missed opportunities, in many regards. It really hasn't been a smooth season. But I think when everything's flowing, when everything's working, right, luck tends to be on your side. But when, you know, you're on the backfoot, you tend to have bad luck. I'm not one for believing in luck. I think you make your own luck. So we just need to be faster. And Lady Luck will be with us. It’s definitely something I'm going to look at over the winter, because the results were so smooth-flowing last year, I think we finished in the top five more than any other driver. And this year, I feel that I've upped my game in my quali pace and upped my game in my race pace. And we've definitely been on the backfoot. But we definitely have more competition this year, with McLaren joining the fight in the second half, Aston being there at the start of the season. But ultimately, we're looking forward to getting through this weekend, trying to cement that P2 in the championship and then eyes on next year. I think the task for everybody is massive. We're all trying to catch up to the most dominant car in F1 history. So that's no short task, and everybody's going to have to come together, really focused, really put everything into it and time will tell. But I think we're going into this winter in a much better place than we were 12 months ago and two years ago. So we hope we're not going to stumble over anything. But as I said, time will tell. I enjoyed it a lot, to be honest. I thought the track was a lot better than first expected. Probably the only thing would be, it'd be good to see other formulas race. The track was always mega-dirty to start with and that makes it very difficult to race on when the whole track is pretty filthy. But, I think the show was great. Schedule was obviously a bit challenging, but added a different dynamic. Yeah, wouldn't change a lot. I want to see the headline Now Daniel Ricciardo, prioritises his body! For sure, it’s pretty brutal for everybody. Yeah, had an interesting trip over, with Pierre. We were flying together and we got delayed and diverted via Dallas and ended-up in a 24 hour diner at three o'clock in the morning for some breakfast. So that was an eye-opening experience. But I think since landing in Abu Dhabi I've been feeling fine. I think the lack of sunlight really affected everybody in Vegas, it truly felt like we were all on a night shift. I was waking up at three o'clock in the afternoon and the sun was set in two hours after that. So, that was the biggest challenge but it was quite a unique experience. And I guess we'll find out this weekend how we're feeling but I'm sure we'll be feeling a lot better than we did last week.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it's a nice place to finish the year. I've got good memories here, winning F2. So nice to be back, racing around here this time. But yeah, it's always a nice place to kind of end the year. You know, nice and warm. It's halfway back to Australia. So that's nice. I enjoy it here. I wish but no I have still got some work to do. But yeah, it's teasing me to go all the way back. I think we should be much more competitive. I think being a new circuit at a drag range that we've struggled at through the year. We knew it would be a tough one for us. I think the pace that we had in the race was much more representative of what we had available through the whole weekend. We just got a few things wrong in qualifying in particular. So you know, that was a decent way to end the weekend. I think we should be more competitive here than that hopefully, and hopefully we can be fighting back at the front properly. Yeah, I think definitely I think we've got the pace to be able to do it. You know, I think the sentiment is quite similar to what George was saying: that if we go out and do what we're capable of and what the car’s potential is, then we should be OK. But you know, we still have to go out there and do our job to get the most out of what we've got. So hopefully we can be quick,  fighting well and truly at the front and then the result will take care of itself. A good question. I mean, there's been a lot of lessons, I think, for me, you can't rest, making a mistake in Formula 1 costs you a lot more than it might do otherwise. You know, all the drivers are extremely competitive. All the teams are now extremely competitive. And if you take it a little bit easy you can suddenly lose a lot of time, a lot of positions. So that's probably the biggest one. I mean, there's been specifics on driving and energy management as well. It's been a busy year. But yeah, just how competitive everything's been, that you can't rest on your laurels. I mean, both! It's been a busy year. I think this double-header has been a tough one for most of us, I would say. But yeah, definitely just having a lot less spare time to relax and stuff like that. It's definitely been the busiest year of my life, but I'm loving it, so I wouldn't change it. Yeah, I think the race was entertaining and yeah, produced good racing, and I think, you know, with the unknowns we had, in terms of the slippery track, cold temperatures, it always adds some unknowns which is entertaining for everyone. Yeah, I think clearly there's some things that we would like to improve. I think the schedule is probably the biggest thing but, you know, we've already been told that it's being worked on. So, you know, they're listening, which is nice. But yeah, apart from that, obviously the track on Thursday was not ideal, having those incidents, but it's not the first time we've had that. Hopefully it's the last time but probably won't be. And yeah, apart from that, I thought it was quite a good event. No, no 24-hour diners. Saw Daniel, actually, on the flight. [waves] There was a few of us on the flight, actually but yeah, I feel like everything's gone very quickly. And I've kind of realised it's because with the time difference and stuff, you lose a day, so it feels like I was in Vegas 24 hours ago, but it was like four days ago. So yeah, it's been a bit to get used to. I’m feeling fine. I think I've gotten into the time zone okay. But yeah, definitely you've got to conserve your energy in these back-to-back weekends. Yeah, I'm going back to Australia for Christmas, which will be nice. Go see my family, my friends. Becoming an F1 driver now, I've given myself an extra week at home mid-season for the race, which is nice but it's still not quite the same as going home for Christmas. So yeah, do that, chill out for a few weeks. And yeah, maybe give myself two-and-a-half weeks to relax. Be nice to go back, have an extended summer. I feel like, apart from Vegas not really had that much cold weather for the year, which has been a nice change. So yeah, be nice to go back home.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,McLaren
Kevin Magnussen,"I think, you know, because of the cool temperatures we had less degradation compared to everyone else. So at least, you know, the pace we had at the beginning of the stint was kind of similar at the end or the competitiveness that we had at the beginning was the same at the end. It felt like there was more potential but looking back at it we still were too slow, so that's why we didn't score points. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Well, I think the upgraded car is more in line with the plan for next year, the concept looks like what we think of for next year. So, it's not actually got more downforce on paper, it's not faster, but it is better to drive, it's easier, the balance is more consistent and that's why you don't see a step back when we run the new spec, although it's got less downforce. I think that's what we need to go into the winter, developing in that direction and hopefully we can take a step forward for next year because it's not been an easy year for sure. There's not been any great highlights I would say, unfortunately. But I think the races where we scored points have been quite… There have been races where I've been extremely happy with a P10, which, you know, just shows what kind of season we've had. But yeah, those races where points have been on the table have been the highlights. Unfortunately it's not been any better than that. Yeah, apart from the issues on Thursday, I think the event was good. I really liked the track as well and I agree with Oscar that the challenges of the evolving track and the slippery surface, in a way, you know, it's the same for everyone. It's… I kind-of enjoy it, in a way, that there's so much evolvement over the weekend, and you have to adapt a lot. So yeah, I liked the event. Except for timings. I agree with that. Yeah, I think for me, it was different when I came back in a way. Having been out of the sport – not completely, I was still racing but in sports cars, and I think just getting away from it, seeing it from the outside, thinking about it from the outside. And then coming back in. I think, in those years before that, maybe I'd lost a little bit of the… maybe a little bit of love for Formula 1. I think you get through the junior categories and it's one thing, and you get to Formula 1 and it's different. For some people, of course, they come in, you know, to Formula 1 after their junior career, and they just get straight into success there. But I didn't, I had many years… well, I had six seasons or something before that break, of not winning at all. So, I think I'd maybe fallen out of love a little bit, and then kind of had that year out, missed it, and then came back and had a new sort of appreciation for it.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Haas
Logan Sargeant,"Honestly, the long straights! No, I think going into the weekend, we knew it'd be a track that suited our car. I think, generally as well, the lower temperatures helped us to be able to get the car in a better window. Very slippery down the straights as well, which helped us compared to the others. But I don't know, I think it was quite nice because for the first time in a long time going into qualifying, we knew we had a bit of a buffer to the cut off. And it just allowed me to sort of build a bit nicer lap after lap, get through Q1. Keep building on that in Q2, and then by the time we got to Q3 I was in a really good place. And I think for the team to start fifth and sixth third row on the grid was obviously a huge reward to everyone in the team for the hard work and we did put a lot of work into that weekend. So the fact that it paid off was nice, but I'm disappointed that didn't carry ​t​hrough on Saturday.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Williams
Lance Stroll,"Yeah. Thanks for noticing! Yeah, feels good. Starting to get a little itchy, but it's a good cause. So hanging in there.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Aston Martin
Valtteri Bottas,"Thank you, yes, good progress. Yeah! Well, I don't send Christmas cards. So, I don't have a list. But of course, I would still send the card if I would. I mean, these things happen in racing. I think it was definitely a missed opportunity. Like the whole weekend we actually seemed strong on that particular track. Every session in top 10, including Qualifying. And then, yeah, everything gets thrown in the bin in Turn 1 with the damage. It is tough to accept but you know, that's the name of the game sometimes. And we've got one more opportunity here to try and get some more points. We’ve got to look forward, so of course we try to get AlphaTauri. It’s only four points and it is realistic to get that – but there’s not been many occasions that we've scored, so we need to get everything perfect, so that's absolutely the target for this weekend, is trying to get them. But for that, we need to focus on ourselves as well. Qatar… All I can remember that it was hot. I don't even know where I  finished. So highlights?  I think, sadly, I would say that the very first race of the season, we had a solid weekend, scored immediately, everything was looking quite good. But then it's been a tough ride. There's been a few occasions we have scored, but not enough times. So I'm definitely waiting for more highlights next year with a new car. In this sport, with the margins we have, it's everything. There's nothing fundamental but the good thing is we do have a completely new car with some new ideas with new people in the team and that's exactly what we need now. So we need to make big steps over the winter. That's the key. Yeah, we have brought upgrades pretty consistently all through the year like any team but some have been decent steps, some really minor so we haven't found anything big throughout the season. It's been steady progress but that's not enough. Meanwhile some other teams they have found big steps, new concepts, innovative things, some might be copying other teams but still we just did steady progress but in this sport, that's not always enough. And ultimately, the biggest thing was how the car was born. It was definitely born better than last year's car but not better enough. That's just how it goes so there's not one thing that is lacking, so that's why I'm really pleased that we're trying to think a bit outside the box now, and with also all the new people we have on board and that will be coming on board. Maybe not that much more to add. It is far away and  you can see it from the people's fases, energy levels, there's more sicknesses, stuff like that. But yeah, I'm sure there's room to improve the schedules and I think there's some steps taken next year already with the calendar but still, it's tough sometimes. The track itself was actually better than what I thought from the simulator so actually the track was alright. Yeah, pretty hectic weekend. In the end, apart from Friday, I think everything went smoothly. I just had not such a great experience. I had a stomach bug over the weekend which got pretty bad so that was kind of the overriding issue I had. All good. All good.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Charles Leclerc,"Well, it’s going to be tight. We have good momentum coming to this race,  as the last few races have been positive for us. However, Mercedes is historically pretty good here in Abu Dhabi so we'll have to put everything together in order to fight them and then beat them in the Constructors championship. But yeah, this is clearly the target. It depends on such fine details that it's difficult to predict before every weekend where you are going to be. As I said, Mercedes is historically strong here so yeah, it's going to be tight, as always, and it will all depend on whoever is optimising the package better, which is up to us. And we'll focus on that throughout the free practices. Well, obviously, we are coming from… especially the last race, that has been very positive. The one before was very positive pace-wise but obviously the result wasn't there for me, but everybody is super-motivated to beat Mercedes in the Constructors’ Championship so yeah, momentum is good. But the big work remains to be done on track and we'll make sure that we do everything perfectly this weekend in order to beat them. Oh, highlights? Maybe last race, but yeah, to be honest it's been a disappointing season.  After last year, we expected to come to this season and try and fight for the championship which after the first race, we straightaway understood how difficult it will be compared to the Red Bull that had done a huge step forward, especially in race pace. We didn't do the same step. So from that moment onwards, it was a bit disappointing. On the other hand, if you just look at this season – forget about last season – I think we've progressed quite a lot throughout the season which is positive and makes me confident for the future. But there's a big gap to fill to get back the Red Bulls so we'll work hard during the winter break and hopefully we'll come back stronger next year with a car that is capable of winning. No, I loved Vegas actually. I really enjoyed the track much more than I initially thought I would and the race was also really entertaining so that was a that was a good thing. Jetlag-wise, I didn't struggle at all which normally I do in some races, but this time I think it's so different and with the 16 hours of flight, I arrived here, I was so tired that I slept like a baby the first night. And since then I am feeling good. So jet lag hasn't been a problem. But obviously then speaking around in the paddock, and especially with the mechanics and engineers, everyone seems to be really, really tired and really struggling with it, which next year I think will be even more difficult because we'll have three races in a row. After that, I believe that we might rethink a little bit the way we organise this last part of the season. Yeah, I think it's definitely too late to change next year, but after that it should all change.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Well, yeah, of course. But it will end at one point, but hopefully not too soon. Yeah, of course it's quite a crazy number. But we've also, of course, had a crazy year, so it would of course be very nice but at the same time also I'm very focused on what's ahead of me and hopefully also next year we have a competitive car again, we can really continue that momentum that we can win more races. Well, I think winning the comeback race in Miami I think was great. I think that was an important one.  Winning at home in Zandvoort was a very nice one and I think winning in Suzuka after the tough weekend we had in Singapore. It’s difficult to tell but of course we are also working on our car to try and make it better. I think we know our weaknesses as well in the car. And that's what we'll of course try to work on plus, of course, trying to make our strengths, of course, even stronger. Of course there are. Look at our race weekend in Singapore. In general, on street circuits, I think we are a bit struggling a bit more like in Vegas also. So yeah, low speed is definitely not our strongest point in the car; bumps, curbs as well. So that's definitely a big area where we can improve. What would it add to know? No, because it's not happening. So there's no point to make up stories if it's not happening. So yeah, I wouldn't mind. It  doesn't matter. Anyone. I don't want to put it like now particularly on Lewis. There's so many great drivers as well. So, yeah, sometimes it just doesn't work out like that. I think if you look at the percentage of men and women in racing, I think already for men the percentage is of course very low to get into Formula 1,  so naturally, of course, for women, it's even harder because there are less women. Of course, I do think physically driving F1 in some places is quite tough but I do think that it's all trainable if you work hard for it, but it is, of course, naturally a little bit harder for a woman. But if you have enough talent, then of course it is possible because I don't think team bosses are people who make decisions to choose their drivers: look at it like ‘oh, no, we only go for men’. If there's a woman who is beating everyone else, then naturally they will have the opportunity to get to Formula 1, but it's just that there are less women in the sport and naturally, of course, the percentage to make it to the top is lower. Yeah, but of course, she was over her peak and I was up-and-coming so it's not really a fair comparison. Yeah, I was just waiting for the announcement. Of course, I knew that it was happening so I'm of course very happy for him but also, I think what was very nice see that, immediately that he got these kinds of opportunities again. So everyone, of course rates him very highly and of course, now I'm excited to see what he can do. I don't really think about it too much to be honest, and especially not comparing it to any other sport because it all works a bit differently, I guess. I think in that way, F1 is quite unique. But I love driving, I think that's - first and foremost - the most important thing to be here. And, of course, winning is of course the best thing in Formula 1 so for me, naturally, the motivation is there, because I know that for most of the races that I go to this year, I have a big chance of winning so naturally, that's great. I think it's of course tougher when you have been in that position and then you come to a race weekend where it's not possible anymore, then it's hard, I think, or harder, to find your motivation. And then you need to try and look, of course into different places, how you can keep that motivation going. But at the moment, of course, when you're on the top, I think it's probably easier than when you're maybe in the middle of the pack. No, no, everyone does it in their own way, I guess. Yeah, it's a bit tough to understand what time zone that you're in. I think what does help here, of course, is that it's all a bit later, like you try to have a good night's sleep and stuff. But I definitely think for the future - of course for next year, it's not possible - but it's a little bit odd that we are on the other side of the world, basically, before getting here and especially when you're talking about sustainability, it's probably not very sustainable, not only for the emissions but also for the human body. Of course, eventually, we always deal with it but I don't think it's great. So we'll just talk to F1 about that, if there's something that we can do for the future to make it a little bit more of a normal end to the year because it's already a lot of races, a lot of travelling in the end, like after the summer break basically. So I think we can do a little bit of a better job with placing the Grands Prix, I guess, but already for next year I think they are doing that at the start of the year so that will help already. Yeah, that's what I meant. I don't mind having a triple-header when it's the Middle East. It’s just the flight time from fully left to go here. It's probably a bit much but yeah, next year, we cannot change that but hopefully in the future we can have a chat and see what's possible and best for everyone.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think the starts were very important today, both of them, I think, were very good, and after that, the whole race was about the management of the tyres. We were good on any tyre but I think especially that middle stint, we could create a bit of a gap and I thought that was very strong there. It all looked quite good, but with the high deg around here, you were constantly correcting the car – so your focus always needed to be there. But luckily, it worked out great today. Very different to this one. I mean, a lot colder. Let’s see what the track grip will do. Street circuit, new for everyone, and I think it will be full of surprises for sure. Yeah, I think it was good. I mean, also, maybe it looks fully easy from the outside, but I think for most of every stint, Lando was matching my lap-times. It was always like the last five to ten laps when it seemed like then, of course, we had better tyre deg. But yeah, the beginning of every stint, I definitely had to focus a lot and I couldn’t afford to make mistakes. And around here with the high deg as well, it’s not the easiest to drive. It’s not like you can just relax and let the car just roll into the corners without any consequence. You had to be really on it. And yeah, luckily, everything we did today, also strategy-wise, pit stops, were good. So, very happy about that. He suddenly closed a lot. I didn't expect him to have a run into Turn 1, but yeah, I had to use my battery a bit. And for one lap, into 1, into 4, I had to defend. And then I had to, of course, try and maintain that gap. But I think what also was very important at that stage of the stint was to really look after the tyres. To make sure that you have a good lap to pit. Well, I mean, with the high fuel loads, normally, of course, it's a bit harder, you have to be more careful, which I think we did, especially in the beginning. But I guess also the track temperature being a bit lower helped. So, I guess pretty similar at the end. I mean, you could still have wheel-spin and still lose positions but, of course when the nearest car, like, it's not there, you can afford to maybe have a little bit of a worse start. But, at the end of the day, once the lights go on, you're focused on trying to do the best start you can do. Yeah, well, I'll deal with that once I arrive to the track. I mean, there's still a lot to do. I still need to go on the simulator. I still don't even know the track, to be honest. So, the last time I tried it on the F1 game, I think I hit more walls than I was going straight. So, let’s hope that’s not the case when I start driving there! But yeah, I mean, it's going to be very different to here: very low temperatures, of course in the night there. Street circuit. We have no experience there. We don't know the track grip. All new. So maybe it will give you a few surprises. I don't know. It's not about that. I mean, it's not something that when I joined Formula 1, I need to have a 75% win record over a season you know. These kinds of things come along when everything just works really well. You know, I feel good in the car, the car is very competitive, and the team barely makes mistakes as well. So then you can get a season like we are having. So for me it's more about just enjoying the moment and trying to maximise every single opportunity. Yeah, I don't mind of course fighting but I've also done many years in F1 where you win two races a year and the rest you are driving to be P5, so I'm just enjoying the moment and embracing it and also enjoying driving of course up front with a bit of a gap. No. No. I don't know, probably I'm a bit more old school in that. I wish social media never existed. Freedom of speech, right? Do you drive to survive? I drive to have fun.",Sao Paulo,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Very good, couldn’t have gone much better, to be honest. Good pace, similar to yesterday, which is the main thing, and a much better start at the beginning to get from sixth to second, which was a nice surprise. But my start yesterday was not so good, so I tried to work on it, and it got better. But then, the second start, I was just a little bit aggressive on it. Still happy. P2 is as good as we can get nowadays and for the time being – but very happy for the rest of it. Not really! I mean, there’s little bits where the tyres come back to you a little bit and you can push on – but Max always seemed to have an answer to everything, which is a shame. But fair play to him, he drove a good race, so yeah, tough, with the wind conditions and everything but P2 is a good result. In terms of position changes? Yes. I don't think it's the quickest one but it's all relative at the end of the day. So, it was a pleasant surprise to come out in P2 already after Turn 1. I was expecting, and we planned a lot for, like, you know, 20 laps in traffic and some overtakes and a bit of fun. And I still had fun, but from P2 already. So, it was a good step up from yesterday. Obviously, that's where I lost out to Max. Not because I had a bad start, I still had one of the best starts on the grid. It's just Max's – especially with that second phase – was extremely strong. So more just comes and goes and today we did some more homework on it and tried to get everything in a better window, and it all paid off. So yep, a good surprise and a good step up from yesterday. Yeah… but I held onto second, so it was fine. Yeah, I think similar to what we saw yesterday in the Sprint. I'm not far behind for the first 10-15, 17 laps but that final phase, I just drop-off a bit too much. I don't know if it's just we're a bit slower and I’m pushing a bit more to try to keep up, and then I pay the price or it's just a little bit of our tyre degradation is not quite as good and we suffer in the slow speed quite a bit with the rears, and that's where we struggle then with the lap time in the end. So, yeah, clear things to improve on, like I said yesterday, but still a very positive day for us. Was it on? I mean, I tried. I just wasn't… we struggled too much in Turn 10, Turn 12. It’s where the Red Bull’s extremely competitive and where we struggle, have struggled all weekend. Apart from when we’re on new tyres, and of course on that restart, I used my new tyres and Max didn't. So, I thought if I was going to have one opportunity, it was going to be there and then. So I used all of my battery, and of course, had DRS and then you do start catching them very quickly. I had a good line in Turn 1, Turn 2, but Max also had a lot of grip. So, you know, if it was maybe later on in the stint, his line in Turn 1, Turn 2 would have been a lot more compromised and a bigger penalty, but because the tyres were still fresh and provide a lot of grip, he got a good enough exit that I then only got alongside him, just before the braking zone for Turn 4. So, I mean, I tried, I would have tried to get past him if I could, and I wanted to, but just a couple more metres would have been lovely. No idea. I mean, I don’t think we were expecting to be as competitive here as we have been. So we're still surprising ourselves. I gave up on guessing where we're going to be nowadays. I mean, probably after Bahrain I didn't want to think of where we're going to be. But yeah, it comes and goes, you know. I think everyone expected Mercedes to be extremely strong this weekend and they were nowhere. [Everyone] expected Ferrari to be a bit more competitive and weren’t, so I think no one really knows. Everyone just guesses and presumes but no one knows until we just get on track. So just let's wait and see. Yeah, I now love Brazil, it’s one of my favourite places. Yeah, I mean, I just haven't had any good weekends. It's not that I have not liked Brazil. I've loved it. And you know, I'm going to spend the next four days here. I came out already on the Monday before and spent some time with my friends. So I do enjoy it here. And, you know, away from the circuit I've always enjoyed. I just haven't had any good races and I think of course this weekend has turned things around a little bit, so yes, it's definitely been a positive weekend. It’s definitely boosted my confidence here in Brazil as an outline. And I think that's a very good thing. So I've enjoyed it. Yes, it's been a good weekend. Another pole… Pole position? I would never count a Sprint race pole like a proper pole or a Sprint race win as a proper win. But yeah, I think it's been a very good weekend from start to finish and I've enjoyed it. I enjoy the challenges, I enjoy the people and I have a lot of friends here, like I said then. So for Landin, Land.. between Portuguese and… Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese. I didn't want to say it wrong. I'm not going to say Brazilian. There is quite a … Landinho and ‘Lanjinho’… I'm still working on it. Maybe. I've just been just saying to Max, since we bought this upgrade to Austria, I've been the second highest scoring driver on the grid. I think we've been the second highest scoring team, potentially. Of course, we've taken some massive steps forward and at the same time, considering we’re talking about fighting the Red Bull, I think it's still a very, very good thing, for what we've achieved this year. We're talking about one of the best drivers in Formula 1 ever, in one of the most dominating cars and obviously it’s a pairing and things have to go well together, but we're talking about a guy who's scored 16…. Is it 17, oh, 17, I apologise… one of the most dominated years in Formula 1 history. And for us to go from where we were in Bahrain to getting close and talking about fighting a Red Bull I think are very good signs for us. And we know we still have plenty more things to come next year. So I'm excited. Having that as a thought, it’s quite a faraway thought. I don't want to think of that just now, there’s no point thinking of it until next year but I'll be optimistic and I believe we can do it as a team. Yeah, it was a strategic retreat! The opportunity to race against Max was only going to be for a few laps. We weren't going to find, all of a sudden, the pace we needed to compete against him for a whole race. And Fernando was behind me. We know that their race pace, especially when the majority of the time when it's high deg and certain things that they can have very good race pace. So yesterday he didn't have clean air, today he was going to be in an opportunity, in a position to potentially just achieve a lot more and I didn't want to compromise my own race by having one more attempt. At the same time, I was low on battery and those types of things. And if you overheat the tyres too much too early you can pay the price quite heavily. I tried. It wasn't worth a second attempt as much as I would have loved to and I think potentially could have done.  Just  it wasn't  worth the risk and potential consequences of then being in the hands of Fernando and the people behind.  So yeah, it was good fun. I thought if there was a little bit more space, or if I was literally a couple metres further down, things could have been a little bit different. But at the same time, to then try to keep Max behind for the rest of the race would have been a whole new challenge. So, good that we're getting there and I had an attempt. I think that's one of my first attempts at really trying to race past him, ever, in my career in Formula 1, which is a good thing, but yeah, that last little thing needs to click and then we can do it more often. I pretty much echo their thoughts to be honest, nothing much different. I watched, I think, the first episode I was ever in, which was end of Season 1 and that was it. That was all I saw. The thing is, when you know everything that goes on, it's nice when they make you look good but then sometimes they also make you look bad. And it's like the real truth at the end of the day. It's still a show, it's to entertain people. It's not there to provide maybe the most honest things about everything. I know, it's for the business, right? It's a business, Formula 1, it's an entertainment. As much as I don't do it for entertainment, if it didn't get televised and all of those things wouldn't really matter. I just want to do the driving, and that's why I'm here. I'm not here to do all the interviews and enjoy all of this stuff. I love Formula 1 because I love to drive and compete against these guys and race and do all of that stuff. And even since I've started, the media has risen a lot more, but in the business world, it probably makes sense because there's more money and all of those things, and that's normally how it works. But as drivers, it's not the thing that we enjoy too much of, but some perks of it, I guess.",Sao Paulo,post-race,McLaren
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, for me it was like 30 laps that I had the pressure from Checo, but yeah, when he passed me, two laps to the end, I thought OK, going on the podium is not possible any more – but then he braked a little bit late in to Turn 1 and I said, ‘OK, I go for it into 4’. And yeah, this is a phenomenal result for the team. We’ve been struggling for a couple of months already, especially the last two events with two retirements. So, this podium is for them, for everyone in the factory, and yeah, we keep fighting until the last lap. Yeah, obviously we’re still learning about the car. These cars are so complex aerodynamically, so, yeah, we’ve been experimenting a little bit to find the direction for next year, without forgetting this year that we’re still competing. So, happy for the result and now to Vegas! I'm not sure, the closest that’s for sure! Yeah, it was a very intense race. And there was no time to relax. Very strategic race as well – saving the tyres, saving the battery always, in case you need it on a DRS opportunity for Checo. And yeah, honestly, I thought that I had things under control in the last stint, until maybe five laps to the end, where I started pushing a little bit more. I had more juice in the tyres and I thought everything was fine. And Checo was playing the same game. He had good tyres at the end of the race and he overtook me two laps to the end. And I thought ‘OK, this is gone’ and then I had one more chance and it was enough. I think when you run just in front of another car, you have better downforce, you have clean air and that was maybe good for maintenance of tyre management. And he was struggling a little bit to go into Turns 10, 11 and 12 behind another car. And that was probably the game that we were playing. Those three corners were crucial for the overtaking opportunity. And yeah, when you are the car in front, you have better grip, always. It is very nice. I think we've been struggling for a few months. But the last two races were probably quite painful. We had to experiment a little bit on a few things on the car to really understand the direction that we were going and we have to go for next year's car as well. So those races were painful, especially Mexico. I think we were very slow as a team, as a performance and yeah, I think it was nice to see everyone in the team very focused, the determination in the team was so nice from the outside to see and to go deep in the analysis and get back stronger here in Interlagos. So that was nice to witness from the outside, in a way, and to see everyone united into the same direction. And yeah, I was a little bit concerned, no doubt, for the last few races and maybe the final part of the championship and now, yeah, I cannot wait to go to Vegas. So it's a very different energy when you have a performing car. I think so. At least closer to these than Mexico, that's for sure. I think there are a couple of things that have been understood inside the team and the direction to go and we had some hopes for this race and they proved to be right. And now, why not to be competitive in the last two. I don't know if [it would be] the level of the podium. Today, we had a good race. We had Charles, obviously, going off on the formation lap with the problem. We had the Mercedes underperforming, Checo starting at the back, so there were a couple of factors that helped us to be on the podium. But, you know, hopefully in the mix, that will be a happy place for us. Normal. I don't know. I think, as I said before, being the car in front, you have a little bit of an advantage in terms of grip in the last three corners. So I was just making sure… Not making any mistake in those three corners, because if not, Checo will be too close. I was using the energy also in the straights just to make sure that there was no opportunity for Checo. And yeah, in the lines, we were just changing lines sometimes. I didn't want to be always on the same line, if possible, like this. If he goes on the inside, I was from time to time on the inside from time to time on the outside. So it was not a clear direction for him to really change the racing line and take the opportunity for some clean air. So I was just trying to get some turbulence to his front nose. Yes, I do remember. (To Lando) How old were you? Five!? It was easier in 2005 because it was non-DRS. So that was probably easier. Now with the DRS, it seems a little bit different and you have to play things a little bit differently as well. And tyre management is also very different than back then, where you can maybe push the tyre all the way. Yeah, true, true. If in 2005 you lose the position, then it's bye bye, you cannot recover and here I had another chance. It has been introduced to provide a little bit better show and today is a good example of that because you get overtaken two laps from the end and then you have another chance,  especially here in Brazil. We saw yesterday as well, when there is an overtaking done into Turn 1, there is a possibility - a strong possibility - that into Turn 4 someone will get the position back. So that's why we see some very nice battles in races always in Interlagos. It has been a spectacular weekend, as always here in Brazil. Sometimes it's the weather providing this great show and I think this weekend without any rain or any weather we saw incredible races. So there is something in this track that always give a perfect opportunity for Formula 1 to shine and it was nice. Obviously the last lap, overtaking him, it was quite a lot of commitment because we were both all or nothing in a few corners. But I think to be honest, the most important overtaking of the race has been Hamilton into Turn 4 on lap one. That changed my race. If I start P4 and I have to fight with Hamilton in the first stint even if I can eventually get him from lap 10 or whatever, my tyres will never be in a condition to extend the first stint and then have a tyre advantage to Checo in the second stint and third stint, so for me there is one crucial moment of my race and it’s lap one, into Turn 4 with Hamilton. Yeah. I'm very focused on the racing and not on this show. I never saw any of this Drive to Survive, even Season 1 or whatever, I never saw any episode. Did you? On Saturdays, yes. We go there, we race even sometimes the parade laps or presentations and things like that,  they are not always in our dream preparation before the race. So we try to balance. We know it’s important for the sport but I think drivers, teams, even for you guys in the media it’s a very long season, a lot of travelling and we just go for racing, this is what we love but the outside package is sometimes a little bit too much but we understand it.",Sao Paulo,post-race,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, we didn't know when it would hit in qualifying but we thought it would hit. But this is of course, insane weather. Charles and I were just discussing, our laps, they felt terrible but I don’t know, I think the wind started to change and started to be very strong. And we lost a lot of lap time because of it. But yeah, it was all quite hectic in the last lap. It seems that it's all very close. You can see that already in qualifying. I expect the same also in the race around here. There’s always quite a lot of deg from the tyres. So it's all about that management. And last year, of course, we didn't get that right. But I think we are a bit better this year. Yeah, the gaps were very, very small between everyone. So yeah, through Q1, Q2, you could see that everyone was using a lot of tyre sets and that made it quite interesting, I think. And then, of course, we lined up to go out for Q3 and you could see the sky was just black. And I was like, wow, if that rain hits it’s going to be a lot. So the out lap was quite quick and then we went for the lap, the first sector felt alright, and then the rest of the lap felt shocking. So I think what happened, of course, throughout the lap was that the rain was coming in, it was not hitting the track yet, but the wind increased a lot. And it changed direction with a tailwind in the middle sector. And yeah, the car was just sliding all over the place. I was shouting on the radio, like, ‘what the hell happened?’ Like, you know, we are nowhere. But the team just told me to keep pushing because they said everyone was struggling out there. But I've never experienced something like that, that it's such a big influence on car balance. But you could also see the weather incoming was quite extreme. Yeah, it was a bit difficult over the bumps. I don't know why that was the case, because we didn't really touch the car. And so we need to understand that because, yeah, on the bumps it was not very comfortable. But yeah, we tried to work our way around it. The gaps were just very, very close. I think we were quite competitive. I think no one really knew who was going to be first in Q3 If it would have been a normal session without the weather incoming. But then that makes it quite interesting for Sunday as well, to see how everything will evolve with the long-run pace. Oh, yeah, we have to do that as well. I don't know. It depends on the wind direction as well, what we get tomorrow. But yeah, I think it will be close again. So we'll see. I don't know. I mean, it was all very tight. I mean, of course, I think in general, these cars they do finish in the top 10 a little bit more than the others, but it rarely happens that I think it's like that in Q3. This track, you know, it's a short lap time, not that many corners and if you make one little mistake or whatever, it's easy to miss out. I think it's also of course, because we only had FP1. So for example, I didn't even have a lap on the Soft tyres, so naturally, in Q1, there is always a bit more margin in your lap time. It was extremely tight. So if you didn't do a good lap, you were out. So that's why I think many people put like two sets or even three sets, some of them. And also, that just continued through the qualifying. There was always that threat of rain, but I think in Q1 and Q2 it was quite clear that it was still not happening, but because of the pace of everyone else you were forced to put new tyres on basically.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it works. Well, for us, to be honest today was… In my whole career I've never experienced something like that! From the Turn 4 onwards I couldn't… I mean, there was no rain, but the car was extremely difficult to drive, no grip. I was thinking about just coming in at the end of the lap. And then I finished in P2. So it's a really good surprise. But it's a very weird one, I think for everybody out on track today. But I'm happy to be on the front row anyway. It's always very difficult. But yeah, today was obviously the right choice. And we did everything we wanted to do. So that's good. I mean, let's see. I don't know about the race yet. In those Sprint weekends, there's always a big question mark on the race pace. But I hope it will be a good one. And yeah, hopefully there won't be too much rain tomorrow and Sunday. It was good. Q1 was really good. We only put one set of new Softs and we were straightaway doing a really good job with the lap, the car was feeling great. We had done quite a bit of change since FP1 and it went in the right direction. So I was happy. In Q2, I just knew I had to just put a lap on the board, which we did and that was good enough. And then in Q3, as Max said, I've never experienced that in my career. I mean, the wind change was crazy. There was just absolutely no grip from Sector 2 onwards, which was extremely confusing, because you had no idea where the balance would be in the corner you would get into, and it made things very interesting. But luckily, I kept it more or less tidy. Even though I was thinking of coming in at the end of the lap. It felt so bad that I was like, ‘OK, this is not good enough, I'm P10 for sure’. But luckily, I wasn't and second place is good. I don't know. I feel like with the lower temperatures in Q2, we maybe struggled a little bit more. So I don't think it would have been enough for pole but I think it would have been close. Ah, we didn't do a lot of long runs. As always in these type of formats we don't have time to do enough long runs. So it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen on Sunday. But one thing for sure is that it's our weakness and we need to work on that. So we'll try and prepare Sunday and obviously tomorrow in the best way possible. Yeah, I think today was a bit the luck of the draw, to get those five teams, both cars in Q3, because as Max said, it's so tight, that it was really down to nothing to get to Q3. So yeah, I don't think that's too indicative. I don't have anything to add. I mean, on these Sprint weekends it’s very difficult to have a read. We did few laps. But again, I think the fuel levels of everybody is very different in this FP1 on such a format. So very difficult to have a proper reading on who is fast, who is not. The feeling was OK. Whether this will be enough to challenge the Red Bull, I think this is a bit of another story, because this year, unfortunately they are very, very strong and much stronger than us coming the Sunday. So we've got a lot of work to do. Realistically, I would say, maybe not. But as always, if there's the opportunity to pass at the start and then to block him for all the other laps then I'll take that.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, for sure the car was feeling good throughout the session, and Q3 was really tricky. My lap was pretty bad. But I think conditions changed a lot. So I had a few lock-ups and missed some apexes. But in the end, yeah, good enough for the top three, which is a great result. Yeah, I mean, it's been tricky, the last couple of weekends. You know, I had a good race in Austin, but then a few days later in Mexico, a really tough weekend. So today was a great day. Yeah, very satisfied. The car was feeling good throughout the whole session, which was good. And yeah, Q3, in the end, was really weird. I think the conditions changed a lot. The wind changed. So my lap was super messy and you know, lock-ups, missing corners, but in the end, good enough for a top three. So that's good, you know. It was a good session. You know, overall throughout the whole session we were competitive and I was feeling good in the car. So it was definitely a much better day for us than we've had in a while. Yeah, very different. Sure, sure. Yeah, it's good. I mean, I don't think we're third on paper. I mean, the conditions and stuff in Q3 were a little funny. And, you know, I think we managed to execute well, that's for sure. I think we did well, going early at the front of the queue and getting in our lap early, before the rain came. I know a lot of people missed their laps, or didn't get clean laps in. So that was a good effort. But we'll see what we can do in the race. You know, the points are on Sunday. But it's still a huge step from Mexico and Austin. We had a good race in Austin. But Friday, Saturday were difficult. So today's definitely the best quali and pace we've had in a long time. I guess time will tell. If we build on today and we can keep up this form in other places… Yeah, I mean, I don't think we were lucky today. I think we made our own luck. I think we did well going, like I said, at the front of the queue and getting good track position. And yeah, the weather was coming in. So I think that was smart. But I still really felt like crap in the car. You know, like these guys said, it was really tricky in Q3 and I think the wind changed direction. So it was still really tough, but I think we did a good job getting both cars, me and Fernando, at the front of the queue. And the team did a good job of giving us an attempt at the front of the queue and before the bad weather came in, and it looks like a lot of guys missed their laps or didn't get them in for whatever reason. So I think we made our own luck today. I think it's tight to get out of Q1! I think it's tight for everyone. You know, here, short lap and yeah, I mean, even for me getting out of Q1, I think is hard. I mean you still have to do a good job. And yeah, it just goes to the show how tight the grid is.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was not an easy one. I had a terrible start, ended-up losing a place to George and then another place to Lewis into Turn 4, and from then on, I was fighting. I had to use all of my tyres and then I think I paid the price towards the end. Overall, it’s been a good day, good points there – but unfortunately, I think without the start, we could have been a lot further up. Yeah, the problem I had is that I couldn’t manage. I had to push and we know that this place is very sensitive for that. So, I ended up pushing a lot and unfortunately in the end it ended-up costing us. Obviously it’s important – but it’s more important to keep the momentum going now. We had a very good day overall and yeah, hopefully tomorrow, which is the main race, we can consolidate on a strong result. It is Yeah, at that time, there was a race, but at that point, when the guys in the lead were looking after the tyres, I was sliding around fighting with Lewis, with George and I ended up paying the price later on in the race. I had a quite a bad start and poor first lap in general, losing another place to Lewis into Turn 4, which meant I had to use much more my tyres and I wanted to. I think I just undershooted (sic) a bit, with the grip there was, and ended up losing a place to George. Well, I think from Austin onwards we've been a lot better than we've shown on pace, you know, but for some reason or another we haven't been able to put it all together. I think in Mexico we were also strong. And obviously, here it's been a good, solid day with the morning. And yesterday, we were very lucky with the Q3 conditions, and then getting the yellow flag at the end. But other than that, I think it's been a good pace. I think it's a lot to do with the degradation, you know. You hit a lot of degradation, as we saw today. Obviously, everyone will learn from the race today and tomorrow will try to improve what everyone had, including me. But generally, it's a race when if you are close in the DRS zone, if you have good traction around the corner, then everything's possible. Yeah, I think we all drive to the limit that we have, like Lando says. I think if they want to get this format of Sprint races, we’ve got to change it. I would propose a reverse grid, something like that to make it more interesting for the fans, because I don't think it's working, what we want to achieve. And yeah, nothing really happens in these sorts of races. Yeah I would. I think it would mix up things and create more opportunities, a lot more overtaking. I mean, if we want to keep this format, give it a go on something quite different. Because I think for the last two years this sort of event hasn’t brought a lot of good racing. I think this rule that was in place, we all knew the rule and I think the people that didn’t respect it got penalised with it yesterday and it's how it should be. Whether it's a good thing or not, it's a rule and we have to stick to them. And we all knew the rules to follow from their preview notes, so I think it's good, the stewards finally are sticking to the rules. I think would be nicer if the GPDA could have a little bit more influence, because GPDA is not just a single driver. It's the board, it’s the majority of all of us that are living the sport and yeah, it would be nice to see in the near future that they will consider more the opinion of the GPDA as an association.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"No, he doesn’t have more power. I think I have more power, but, I don't know. I have to review it. It’s something to look back on to. Like you said, my initial start was good but the second phase of the launch… maybe I was just a bit conservative. I don’t think I had any wheelspin. I was just a little bit on the safe side. Things to improve for tomorrow but nevertheless, caught sleeping a little bit with George on Lap One but the pace was strong after. I tried to go after Max, but just didn't have enough. But it was good fun. Sixth! There was no-one around me, apart from Max, and he’s in a Red Bull, so no, I’m not concerned. If anything, encouraged a lot with how good our pace was today. We’re not fighting necessarily Max. I think we’re talking about competing against one of the best drivers in one of the best cars that’s ever been in Formula 1. We’re not going to be suddenly fighting a Red Bull in a track which we almost didn’t expect to be as good as it has been again. So, many good surprises and a lot of positives for us. Of course, tomorrow I’ll try again but I’ll have to do a bit more overtaking. I’ll try. Talk you through it… I was first and then second… I don’t know, I think I have to re-watch it. I'm not sure what happened. My reaction and initial drop was good but then the second phase, not so good. But that's all I know for now. So yeah, tough opening lap I would say. Obviously not what I wanted and then always difficult to manage the tyres as much as you want, when you're in second. But still a good race, it was still good fun. I was caught sleeping a little bit with George. He was pushing a lot on the opening couple laps and I feel like maybe he paid the price quite heavily on lap three and four and five and six and seven and eight, all the way to the end. But I tried then to get into the DRS of Max. I thought if I had an opportunity, I would try and get it early on, so I could kind of control the race a little bit more from out front and in some cleaner air. But I never quite got close enough and I struggled just a little bit too much, especially in the last five laps of the race, to look after the tyres as much as Max was able to do. But nevertheless a strong race and good points. I was managing in qualifying already. These are the tyres from quali, right? So yeah, it's a tough circuit. You don't feel like you can push anywhere. It's kind of always a little bit like this, but it feels, I don’t know, similar to COTA in a way, like you do two laps then after that you’ve got no grip and you're managing and you have one little wheel spin and it costs you two or three tenths straightaway. So again, a management-based race. Positives, because this definitely wasn't a circuit where we were expecting to be at all close to the Red Bull. If you look at the data from last year and where we're good and bad this definitely wasn't up there with one of the good ones. And we weren't expecting it to be, necessarily, a very good one and sometimes we're good in quali and then quite poor in the race. But today we were good compared to everyone, except Max. So yeah, tough, but a good day for us. I mean, it's always different. Definitely good confidence. You know, I didn't do any more laps than three in a row in FP1. So we were a bit blindsided with what to expect, but of course, that was our choice. But maybe we weren't best prepared for what to expect today, but still to be so good was a positive sign. And we'll try and maximise that for tomorrow. Of course, I think we know what we're aiming for. Probably not P1. But up there in the top three is probably our goal. On the topic of Sprints? Nope. I don't know, it doesn't matter what we say. Our choices rarely have much effect with anything. Especially with this. So, everything seems dictated by team bosses and what they want to do and what they choose to do. I mean, you say we're not pushing, but you still push to the limit you have. Of course you're not pushing like it's qualifying. I don't think you’ve ever pushed like it's qualifying, probably ever in Formula 1. But you still saw good racing apparently, from everyone behind. So if everyone is pushing flat out, I would say you almost probably see less overtakes than what you did today. So in that sense, you're probably asking for a more boring race, which is not what you want. So I think what we had today was tough and maybe not the most enjoyable, you don't feel like you're pushing that much but you’re still driving on the limit of the grip you’ve got and all of those things. It’s still a challenge for us behind the wheel. I think it’s exciting for the people who get it right and people who don't get it right. But if you've got no degradation at all, then I’d probably say you're not going to have one overtake for the whole race. I don't mind, to be honest. Again, we have no say in these rules. They just get implemented no matter if we think it's good or bad for the sport. Same with the minimum lap time stuff. I got a reprimand this morning for two cars ahead of me coming out of the pit lane, or one crossing over the Safety Car line, one coming out of pit lane at the same time. I can't overtake, otherwise I'm going to be racing on a qualifying lap, which is stupid. So I have to back off, and therefore I'm below the minimum time and I get a reprimand for that. It's just a silly thing. Not that the stewards made the wrong decision, it’s just a rule that shouldn't be in my opinion, because I did absolutely nothing wrong. I didn't block anyone. I didn't get in anyone's way. I've just not overtaken and caused a race in qualifying and I get a reprimand for that. So just silly things. And even with this, it's a tough one. Of course, people do go slowly and things like that, but if you're scared of it, just go out of the pit lane earlier and avoid all the queueing. It's quite a simple one. The only point is when you have like four minutes left on the clock or two minutes left on the clock, and you’ve got a guy at the front of the queue who just waits 30 seconds, 20 seconds. Does a Fernando and Lewis, back in McLaren, and you kind of screw everyone over, so that's the only probably unfair thing. But I think there's just more and more rules for everything and it just causes more and more havoc for everyone. Obviously, I know probably a bit more than what everyone sees, but my last few weekends have been very strong. I probably say like the last four or five weekends have been my strongest in terms of absolute pace and extracting the maximum out of the car. I just made those silly little mistakes here and there in qualifying, whether it was Mexico or previous races. But a lot of these times the pace was probably some of my strongest and the best I've been driving, if it wasn't for these little things. And, of course, then I'm disappointed at times and I always say I should have been on pole or I should have been second and there just have been a lot of should-have, would-have, could-haves, which I understand, but it's because it's the truth. I think today we proved it, but yesterday we probably should have been on pole if we did as good of a job as we did today. That same goes for us in Qatar. And the last two, three weekends, I feel like I've been on top of things a lot more. And I have felt very comfortable. There's still a lot of things which I'm not comfortable with but I definitely feel most on top of the car than I ever have been. And some of that is figuring out weaknesses that I have with the car and just things that I'm struggling with. And some of it is just confidence and putting things together and executing laps and executing good races and things like that. So I don't think it's just this weekend or anything’s suddenly changed. But here, Mexico, Suzuka, Texas, Qatar, I think all of these have been some very good races, very good performances, extremely good pace, probably in every single one but just a few too many of these little mistakes. And I think that's why I've been disappointed, it’s when you're missing out on a pole or P2.  You feel like  you've missed out on some very good opportunities. And we need it for the championship. We want it against Astons and things like that. So yeah, just some difficult moments and things I know I need to work on as a driver, but I know it and working on it. So yeah, a good weekend for me so far. Of course, not a great job as team yesterday in qualifying but I feel like we made up for it today. I’ll just correct you, because you're probably going to headline it ‘stewards don't listen to what drivers say’, but I definitely didn't say that. I just said that we don't have control of the decisions. Of course, they listen to us and they take it on board but if we go ask ‘can you please do this’ all of a sudden, of course they listen to it but it doesn't mean it’s going to be something that gets changed straightaway. And sometimes it's for later on down the line. So don't misquote me.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"yeah, I think it was, of course, important to try to get ahead at the start. I think the initial launch wasn't, let’s say, amazing but the second part of the start was very good. So, we got alongside and yeah, then it was all about management. You know here, this track, there’s a lot of deg. The tyres are wearing a lot. So, 24 laps on one tyre set is very long, so just trying to maintain a constant lap-time, and I think we managed the race quite well out there today. No, I mean, last year was very difficult for us around here, so today was much better but yeah, it’s still, for everyone out there, you know, you can’t push flat-out. It’s all about just keeping the tyres under control – and I think we did that well today. Yeah, it’s a great start. I think we learned a lot during that race and hopefully we can do something similar tomorrow. Yeah, I think the initial getaway wasn't that fantastic. I think my release wasn't very good, but then the second bit was very strong, and I could get alongside. So that definitely helped, of course in the beginning of the race. We know 24 laps around here, it’s all about tyre management. Yeah, just incredibly difficult around here. A lot of deg. I mean, last year we were struggling a lot with that already in the Sprint race and that’s why I was a bit careful. And yeah, luckily it worked out. I mean, the whole race, the tyres, they don’t feel particularly great around here. But yeah, with the management that we did, I think it worked out and we won the race. The out lap! There is not one lap where I pushed flat-out. You can’t. It’s impossible. Yeah. It’s like handing a cookie! I’m joking. I think, like I said, it’s all about management. At one point in the race it looked like, you know, Lando was catching a bit, and then I had a better feeling with the car again and I could look after the tyres a bit better and I could pull away again at the end, so yeah, it was close. And I think tomorrow also we have pit stops in the race, so you never know what can happen. Put some rubber down! Yeah, we’ll see. Tomorrow again is also a bit of a different start on full fuel loads, so I think it requires again, a bit of a different launch but we’ll find out tomorrow. Just a normal race weekend, please. Thank you. I'm not interested in any change. I don't like it. Absolutely terrible, I think, because on this track you have quite a long pit exit and there are some walls. But on some other tracks, if we implement this, you're driving very slowly on to a straight where people are passing with 300+, and you are maybe driving 15/20 to make a gap, which is I think extremely dangerous. So for me, this doesn't work at all, it just creates even more trouble. Look at what was happening yesterday, people going on the grass, including myself, to try and pass cars. It's just a mess. Every single qualifying you have six to eight cars getting noted for driving too slow with the minimum time. I don't know what we're trying to achieve. Yeah, I think it just sometimes has too many rules that they have to take into account and too many politics as well to make a change or decision. Of course, I would like to, as the GPDA, to have a say. I would like to be the owner of F1 if I could, you know what I mean, but that's not the real world. But, yeah, we keep expressing our concerns, but also what has been done correctly. And we keep that dialogue, let’s say, open, we try to always make them listen, and we listen as well, we tried to communicate and we'll see what comes out of it in the coming years.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,Red Bull
Daniel Ricciardo,"Yeah, like it felt… well definitely, obviously this sport you’ve got to kind of keep backing it up. Obviously it’s nice to have a good weekend but to just have one, in my mind, it’s not enough. But, of course, for me, to have a strong weekend from start to finish, I think spoke something. It was something that obviously I have struggled with the last year or two. Didn’t have many weekends like that. I think also this year was just about me, like rebuilding I guess, myself again and just trying to find, as people say, that old form or that old me. So, Mexico felt a lot like that. Even the lead-up. Everything about that week, I was just very, very ready. Ready to go. So it was nice to back up everything I hoped the weekend would be. 1996, I think it was! It’s been a while. It wasn’t like every weekend at McLaren was bad. There was some that were good but I’d probably have to go back to more… 2021 as opposed to 2022. It was a while – but I think from start to finish, that was one that, in a car that is still relatively new for me, obviously it was my fourth proper race weekend of the year, so I think to have that feeling quite early, and also just to have an understanding… already I think I have a good understanding of what I want from the car. So, in terms of set-up, we were able to change a few things going into Mexico, and I think that as well, translating into the feeling I was looking for, I think that’s also really positive. Yeah. I think fourth in Qualifying, coming into Qualifying, it was clear in my mind that we were going to be Q3. I had a lot of confidence and faith that we were going to have no issue getting into Q3, especially with a couple of extra tenths from a tow from Yuki. So, that obviously got us in there quite comfortably – but even Friday night, I’d played a lap out in my head. And I was, alright, maybe everything going well tomorrow, it won’t just be like a Q3, like a tenth. It’ll be maybe a seventh. That would be amazing – the fourth was a little better that we probably thought. Honestly, it wasn’t after ‘til… I was very happy with it, doing the press afterwards and that, but it probably wasn’t until Monday, Tuesday where that kind of sunk in a bit more. Yeah, so… I don’t know what you want me to say! I was going to try to say something funny! It was cool. That was one thing I said. Fourth, yeah, fourth is great but it’s not like Max or Charles on pole in that case was eight-tenths down the road. We were just over two-tenths from pole and that as well felt as good as the fourth. We were there, we were competitive. As obviously positive and awesome as Mexico was, now you switch the focus to this weekend. It’s nice coming into a weekend after a good result but we have to start from scratch here in terms of… we’ve got one practice session. I think we have a bit more confidence in where to start the car with set-up – but different track, different conditions, so we’ll come in with the confidence but definitely staying grounded. I think, yeah, I've done four. Spa was a sprint? I think yeah, then Austin. So, out of now, which will be my fifth race, three of them have been Sprints. So I'm like a Sprint veteran! I liked some of them. I think there’s room for a few of them across the calendar. It does change it up a little bit. I still, like, prefer a conventional weekend. You know, if it's one or the other I'd take the conventional. But, look, if we have obviously in a season of 23-24 races, if half a dozen of them are Sprint, I think yeah, it adds a little bit of spice. But I wouldn't want to go down, say, the MotoGP route and have it every weekend. I haven't. Yeah, obviously, all the stuff around my contract next year has been related to AlphaTauri. So yeah, that's, I would say that's honestly as far as that goes, I think. Yeah, for me personally, having a weekend like Mexico is just definitely good for the soul. And also, like, for the team, you know?  I haven't been here long but for them to be tenth in the Constructors’, and to jump two places in the space of two weekends was huge. So, I think that kind of creates a very happy atmosphere around everyone. So that's, yeah, kind of happy doing that. And try to just keep charging on where I am. The atmosphere is definitely one. A lot of passion. Yeah, sorry, it's a triple header. I feel like we're all starting to feel the effects of it. But I remember my first race here. Like the Drivers’ Parade was cool. It felt like what you'd get at probably like a football match or something, you know, with lots of drums and flares and a little bit of dancing and so that was cool. And yeah, even though, like 2016 maybe for me wasn't like a highlight result, just that race was wild, you know. I remember that as a crazy one. Obviously Max, my team-mate at the time, had a really phenomenal race. And I remember after the race, I realised he nearly crashed and then saved it and it was just, yeah… Even, I think maybe Kimi was stuck on the straight and there was a red flag or something. Maybe it was that year and I didn't even see Kimi. I didn't know what the red flag was for. So visibility was just insane. Yeah, foggy visor. It was just wild. So that was a chaotic race, but certainly still a pretty probably iconic one in in my time. And then as a fan, as Lando mentioned, the 2008 season finale, that was wild.",Sao Paulo,thursday,RB
Max Verstappen,"Keep it a bit shorter please! Erm… maybe! I don’t know. Well, last year we didn’t have a great race weekend here. And now, with also the Sprint format, makes it quite difficult to straightaway be on top of things. We had a few ideas why last year was not that great but one practice session to make sure it’s better this year. I think there’s a lot of high-deg here, and the way you have to set up the car, a lot of low-speed corners. I don’t think our car is particularly, let’s say, amazing in the low-speed corners, so I guess we’ll find out. Yeah! Last year it was definitely not a great weekend, you know? We’ll definitely have to try to do better. A lot of different things but it’s every single weekend, you know? Different things happen. Some weekends you learn more. Some weekends you learn less. Sometimes you hit the ground running, the car is unbelievable, you barely touch the set-up of the car. Whereas sometimes you have weekends, where it’s a bit harder to get on top of things, driving wise, set-up wise, and you might find out a bit more. You might learn a bit more in the race, certain scenarios, you learn more. Yeah, we can go on forever but every single weekend is different. Yeah, I mean, I, of course, got my own esports team, and of course, Red Bull as well. So, basically, we kind of merged for a few particular platforms. I think the most important one is, is F1 esports. We’ll take over the performance side of things. So yeah, very exciting stuff ahead. I mean, yeah, I think we all have a lot of great drivers in the teams. So, putting that force together, I think is very exciting. And hopefully, of course we can do well. Not in F1 esports. I'm too slow. I'm too old! Yeah, it’s been absolutely fantastic. So much fun. I get so excited by having a Sprint again. I'm all for it. Good question. I think at the end of the day, I think that it shouldn't always matter on me, you know, to get the points, but I'm confident that in Checo, that you know, he can stay ahead, because I do think that, on average, you know, we have the faster car. And I think also last year, it wasn't really well spoken about before we got into the race weekend. But yeah, let's just hope that we don't get into that situation, I think is better for everyone. Yeah, nice questions today here. I always had a great relationship with Daniel, when were team-mates, when, of course, we weren’t, but at the same time, also, I have a great relationship with Checo and I find it a bit unfair to now sit here and say who I would prefer as a team-mate or whatever. I mean, they have been great team-mates, and it's not up to me at the end of the day to make these kinds of decisions, because I'm very focused on my own performance. So yeah, I mean, if it's Checo next year, then, you know, great. I have a great working relationship with him, but also personally, I think he's a great guy. And if it's Daniel, then also we will get along fine and we have a great time. But yeah, F1 can be a tough sport and you're asking these kinds of questions, but yeah, maybe also nothing happens right, so we'll see. Yeah, quite a few good memories. I think the wet race [in 2016] that is typical Brazil style. You know, you have weather incoming and I think it makes it all a bit more special. It seems like it's going to be dry on Sunday, but you never know. Of course getting your like your first win here at this strike. I think that was very nice. Could have been one more, but that didn't work out. Yeah, I mean the track doesn't have a lot of corners, but it's quite a technical infield. Yeah, I always enjoy coming here. The support has always been great. Very passionate, as well. So hopefully again, a great weekend. Who are the leaders? Did you watch the game or not? Yeah, it's been very good. I was in Brasilia, it was very relaxed. Yeah, good weather. A bit of rain here and there as well, but it's quite nice to cool off a bit. I don’t what else say. I think it's always great, you know, to spend a bit of time with your close ones and family.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Red Bull
Lance Stroll,"Just yeah, I mean, speed we, you know, we're just lacking speed in the corners. You know, the high-speed corners? Yeah, everywhere. You know, we just weren't very competitive last week.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Aston Martin
Lando Norris,"Nope! I played yesterday here in São Paulo, but… I'm feeling alright. I've not been playing a lot of golf at all over the last few months, just for different reasons. So, I've kind of lost touch but I've tried to get back into it in the last few days, and I will continue to, before Vegas next week and before the event. So, I'm sure I’ll be alright – or at least get carried by my team-mate. I don't know if I'm allowed or not. But sure, Rickie Fowler. A good guy. I watched all of the guys and Ricky is kind of a bit more back on form lately, comparing to where he was at the beginning of the year and last couple of years. I’m excited. It's going to be the first live event for Netflix, which is a cool thing to be part of. Nice course and everything. And yeah, I don't know, like how the whole event is going to work but I'm sure it's going to be good, fun. Basking? Just what was my secret? Qualifying badly was my secret! Makes it a lot more fun coming from starting at the back. So, I mean, the pace was great all weekend. Maybe not amazing Qualifying, but good enough easy to be into Q3 and so forth. So, we knew the pace was going to be good on Sunday, maybe not almost as good as what it was, especially that that final stint. I think the first stint was good, but just hard to make a lot of progress at the beginning. But a second stint, yeah, you know, once you get the tyres in a good window and things start to come towards you, then things started to flow. Felt very good out there. So, many different reasons but, yeah, just good pace, good tyre wear, good management, and that made it a very enjoyable race. No. No chance. I mean, I don't know. Like, I hate answering this question. I don't think anyone knows, really. Just some weekends we're good, sometimes not so good. Definitely here and Mexico are the two races we weren't expecting to be too strong comparing to Qatar and Suzuka, and things like that. So, not expecting to set the world on fire but I think considering how good Mexico was in the race, and where we potentially could have finished, if we started higher up, then I still look forward to it. But it's never tended to be our strongest weekend, or one of the strongest weekends. So yeah, we'll keep our feet on the ground and keep pushing. But I'm sure we can still have a good weekend. I'm in the middle. I've always liked the normal race weekend, to be honest. So, if I could just choose, I just go back to having that. But the reason is for the fans and to put on more of a show and things like that. I like the challenge of just FP1-Qualifying. I think it's better. I think it's, for me, more enjoyable, more of a challenge for the engineers and for us as drivers. So, if we just had FP1-Qualifying and a main race, you know, Saturday-Sunday, there'll be nice. Two days. So yeah, I think that's maybe the only thing, but it's not my choice, so doesn't matter. I think it's tough to mix it in with races of podiums, you know, whether it's P2s or P3s and things like that, it's always hard to ever say it's as good as one of them. But I think in terms of management and not giving up, that kind of thing, especially after the restart and dropping to 14th, I think in terms of management, and from that stage of it, it was probably one of my best races. Race pace was never my best and my strongest suit, even a couple years ago, so to have now almost turned it into one of my strengths and qualifying being almost a thing I need to be working on a bit more, then that’s a good sign. So I enjoyed it a lot. It was definitely one of my better performances. But it's also a very different situation to Austin and going from the front and kind of trying to lead the race and control the pace and things like that. It's a very different situation to be in. So one of my best? Yes, but difficult to compare to the rest. I don't have many great memories from Brazil. Just because I have not had many good races here. Not for any other reason. I don't remember any race growing up, here in Brazil, probably apart from [Timo] Glock. That's probably about it. That's the only thing I remember watching growing up. So I think it's just always enjoyable coming here, because of, like you said, because of the fans, and just the history of motor sport here. A lot of fans nowadays are fans who have got into Formula 1 through Netflix, and they don't know a lot about the history of motor sport and Formula 1, and all of those things. Whereas I feel like the Brazilian fans are fans who have been in it for a very long time and are very passionate within racing. And I've watched it since Senna was here and Piquet and all of these guys, and Massa and all these guys. So yeah, I know, a weird one for me because I just never grew up watching a lot here and there's nothing that's special from a driving side. But I have a lot of good friends here and a lot of support. So it's always a pleasure to come back. Yeah, I mean, Palmeiras won last night against the leaders. They were 3-0… I don't care. Not Palmeiras. That doesn't matter. I don't want to name them. The other team were leading 3-0 at halftime and Palmeiras made a great comeback to win 4-3, so it give them a chance… Not this year. Yeah, I watched the game. Yeah, I was supporting Palmeiras. I do ever year, actually. I mean the last three years. Last year I went to the game and it was nice to go to the stadium and Abel [Ferreira] the manager, I invited him to the circuit last year too. So he came. I mean there's not many football games that I've ever been to but I've probably been to more Palmeiras games than I have anyone else, but it’s just become a bit of a thing every time I've come here so I'll just say congrats to them for yesterday. And they kept the championship fight alive. So I hope that they can go on to win it.",Sao Paulo,thursday,McLaren
Valtteri Bottas,"That is correct. It's November, so I’ve got to start from zero. Actually I do it for charity, for Movember, I had a bit of a scare this morning when I looked in the mirror, but only a few days and we're good. I've got my own Movember page. You can find the link from the link tree on my Instagram account. I think the race pace wasn't quite as we were hoping for. But the bigger issue was track position. Pretty much the whole race being stuck behind cars. And that way, you can't really show the pace and see the real pace. So I think that was the bigger issue. Not the luckiest race as well with timings. You know, the Safety Car became for both of us in the worst possible timing. So just a bit unlucky as well. It does. I think we had a good one here last year in terms of pace. So yeah, I have full confidence that we can score. And that's what everyone in the team needs to believe. Everyone just wants points. You know, everyone has the right mentality. We know that. We didn't succeed in the last event or in the last couple of events, but it's important to get together, you know, to make sure that we all work as a team towards the same goal. So it was nice to get together. I like the Sprint always. I've never been a big fan of three practice sessions. I prefer to have one and then straight to action so that's the nice side of a Sprint weekend. Obviously there's always things that could be changed. For example, for us as a team at the moment, unfortunately it is only the top eight that can score in the sprint so most often it's a bit of a long shot at the moment for us, which is not ideal but of course it's depends on which car you are. But other than that, I'm more than happy to do a sprint. I think many of the things have been… well, some of the things have been addressed for the next generation of cars. So I believe they should be a bit lighter, that's naturally going to go to improve racing. Maybe a little bit smaller as well was the right direction. But yeah, I still think with the format, especially on the Sprint weekend there's work to do. And I always keep saying single lap qualifying would be exciting so that you would synchronise that, yeah, that's one by one, people could follow each car. And imagine the amount of tyres we would save? We are using so many tyres in the weekend and if we want to be more sustainable as a sport, I think that's one argument. Oh, yeah, lots of good memories from here always. It really provides good racing and unpredictable races and weekends as well, sometimes thanks to the weather.  But favourite ones? Have I won here? I don't know. I can't remember. No. A Sprint, maybe.  I've been on pole. I take the pole as the best memory. But also yeah, like Carlos said, watching the races in the past. Yeah, some really iconic moments here.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Logan Sargeant,"Obviously it was a weird one. It was a Sprint race last year and I still did FP2, with a different format. But yeah, it was pretty much a session where I was just told, don't use kerbs, look after the car, it was already under Parc Fermé. But no, it's still good to know the track. It's a Sprint weekend. So that's going to be tricky. The weather looks a bit mixed, but yeah, at least I have a base understanding of it.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Williams
Charles Leclerc,"I am. I am. [To Lewis] Oh yeah, we have to play for sure. But I am better than Pierre, yes. Yeah, but we only played one, so I’ve won 100% of the time, which is a good record to have. But I'm sure we'll have many more chances to play together. Oh, yes, Ayrton is the one and only idol I've ever had. And the foundation and the family invited me to the foundation in São Paolo. So I had the chance to see the car he has been racing in. Also a few helmets that he's been using, and it was really, really emotional. And also the family has been welcoming me in the best way possible. Viviane has explained me many stories, and also the stories of the helmets and the cars in there. And it was a very, very special moment for me for sure. I mean, it's always nice, but at the same time, for me, it matters the most on Sunday and in races. And at this time we don't we don't really have the car in order to make those pole positions a win, or at least a really good result on Sunday. So we really have to work on that. And that's where we are all focusing at the moment, to try and find performance coming the race. And we've still got quite a bit of work to do. So it will be amazing to be on pole. But I would rather have a win than a pole this weekend. I don't think this has a big influence on our performance. I think it's more down to the track characteristics. But again, it's very difficult to predict this weekend, and especially on Sprint weekends, FP1 is super important. It's very easy to put a foot in the wrong direction, if that's a good expression, and then the whole weekend you cannot really recover if you do a mistake in FP1 with the set-up. So it's going to be super important to have a strong FP one. And hopefully that will be a positive weekend for us. I quite like it. I like the fact of having only one free practice session. I don't think we should have more than six Sprint weekends in a year. I think six is good. But to have one free practice and go straight to qualifying is something I enjoy. I think the Saturday could be changed and improved but I really like the Friday, to not have three free practice sessions is really long and sometimes it can get a bit boring. We always go through the same programme. So I like the fact of having only one free practice and go straight to the action with qualifying. I don't believe in magic. So I will say race pace is what we are missing the most but I will also say that yes, we are missing 22 points to Mercedes and short-term, this is where we should focus. But I think the whole team is well aware that that's not the target for Ferrari. Ferrari wants to be back on top. And there are many more points to recover to be the first team, especially against a Red Bull that is extremely strong at the moment. And that is the medium to long-term target and yeah, so that's why we are putting all the efforts in order to be back to the level of performance we've seen at the beginning of last year, where we were fighting for wins and fighting for the championship. Then, unfortunately, it was more difficult since then. But as you said, I think what we are missing at the moment is mostly the race pace. But I think since Zandvoort, we've done big steps forward in the understanding of our car, in the concepts that we have and the directions we've been taking.  Until now the first part of the season was mostly down off experiencing what were the best directions to go into for the future. And then since Zandvoort we've set it a little bit more and understood which is the direction to push. So this gives me the confidence that we can close the gap in the future, then how close or when is much more difficult to answer.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, so it's been a special race for me. I mean, I won my first World Championship here. It was kind of crazy back then, because I kind of felt like public enemy number one. Obviously, I was racing against Felipe. But the growth that I've felt here and the reception that I've had here, the amazing support… But I mean just as a kid, growing up at home, being a fan of football, for example. Always loved the Brazilian colours. And me and my brother would play FIFA, for example, and he would always take England, so I'd always take Brazil. And then there was Ayrton Senna, as Charles mentioned, who was just such a big hero for so many of us. And when you come out here, you really feel his presence. And it's just such a beautiful culture. And the track is iconic. You know, they don't build circuits like this anymore. So it's a race that I think all the drivers really love. It’s a race that it's fun to drive a single lap but the races are very strong here, you've got that long straight which you can overtake on and the follow through, Turns 1, 2 and 3 and then have a fight down to Turn 4 so a good overtaking place as well. I don't really know. I expect the Red Bull to be very fast, as always! It seems to work pretty much everywhere, except for Singapore. And we expect the Ferraris to be quick. I hope that our car works well here like it did in Austin but you can just never predict – it could be bad, it could be good. So we're just trying to prepare the best way we can. Yeah. It's a really fun, enjoyable battle and these guys did a great job in qualifying at the last race but fortunately we were able to leapfrog them but I think it's going to  be close. And these last three races, it's going just take all hands on deck to stop these guys. Yeah, I feel pretty much the same as these guys. Saturday's not the greatest of days, but I like the single practice session straight into qualifying. I think we can learn. I love that we do have a different format, rather than just the same three practice sessions and then the qualifying and the race. But the best Sprint race I ever had was when I started last and so I'm in favour of the reverse order, except if we had that then everyone will just try and qualify last! But I think it maybe should be a little bit longer the Sprint race because it's something like 19 laps or something. I don't really have an interesting answer for you. I've not sat down and thought ‘this is how you can make the sport better’. I think it would be it would take a lot of work. I agree with some of the things that Valtteri said, but yeah I don't have a solution for it just yet. I said it's not easy to predict. I really don't know. After the last couple of races, you get messages from people like ‘oh, it's looking good’. I'm like ‘it was looking good at the end of last year, too’. But we started 1.5 seconds behind at the start of the year. So I'm not dazzled by where we are currently. I'm proud… the only reason I'm on the podium is the great work that's gone in the background, but I'm more thinking quite long-term at the moment. And then short-term just trying to solidify second in the Constructors’ because that's so important for everyone within the team. But I anticipate the Red Bulls are going to blitz it because their car has been great but if that's not the case, then I'll be ready to take the fight to them. If it can be anything like Austin and we can get the strategy better than that would be incredible. And I came away empty handed last year, so I  don't plan on that this year. I honestly pay no attention to it. So I don’t really… also the same.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, all good. I'm playing as much as I can but not as much as I would like, because of how busy we are with F1. But yeah, hopefully next week I'm getting a few rounds in.  I'm going to go on holiday for a week before Vegas,  staying out in the US and then flying there so by the time I get there, I'm hoping to be a bit warmed up for the match. I've been told, but I'm thinking I'm not supposed to tell you. I would be revealing something that Netflix wants to reveal. No, no I'm playing with a pro golfer. But I think I don't want to screw it up. I think Netflix might want to announce that themselves. Although maybe they're there. Maybe, can I? I do believe that Mercedes has a bit the upper hand, mainly because they're heading the championship and 22 points is quite a bit. And also, given the points are done on Sunday and that's where the Mercedes comes stronger and we are the weakest, I think for sure they have a bit of the upper hand. But at least we're managing to keep the pressure on and they cannot afford to make any mistakes because we're there to capitalise on them. It's  a fun battle, like Lewis said. We're always very close to each other in the races. Normally, it's them chasing us or overtaking us in the race and hopefully we can reverse that in the last three races and at least not get overtaken and manage to finish ahead because that's where the points are given. I think we simply have a bit of a weakness there. It's been there all year. We always tend to do better in qualifying than we do in the race. Then we have the inconsistency of the stints. There's some stints during the year that we've been very good in the race, and then other stints that we've lost out a lot depending on the compound, on track conditions and the way we treat the tyre. So we just simply seem to be a bit less consistent on that front and that's where we're putting all of our efforts into these last three races and going into next year, to see if we can manage to change that deficit that we have. Yeah I wouldn't mind. I think right now, I agree that six is enough. I agree that Saturday's too revealing of what's going to happen on Sunday. It is basically the first stint of the race of Sunday, what you're watching on TV, and this doesn't help, I think, the show for the main race that is the Grand Prix. So you arrive to the point, you’d better try something else on Saturday. Is that reverse grids? Is that single lap qualifying? Is that… whatever, I don't know. But I think given that the Sprint format is a bit of an experiment going on right now in Formula 1, I would be open to keep experimenting to see which format is best because for me the one we have now, just Saturday, doesn't feel completely right for what then comes on Sunday. I think the raceability of the cars has been improved and we need to keep working on that direction, make them maybe a bit narrower, bit lighter and keep the aero under control so we don't suffer too much when we're behind each other. I think the circuits can make a bit of an effort too.  I think when we go to circuits like São Paulo, Austin, there are circuits that are just simply a lot better for overtaking than others. And I think there can be made a bit of an effort in other track designs, future track designs or even designs that are already made. But that's pretty much it, everything else, I think Formula 1 is in a very good moment right now. And it's giving a good show, even though obviously Max is dominating, the races are sometimes still quite exciting. So if it's not broken, don't change too much. Yeah, well my best memory by far is obviously getting my first ever podium in Formula 1,  thanks to a five-second penalty to you, Lewis. When was it? 2019? So I kind of owe you a bit of a podium there. That made me happy. And yeah, once that happens, then all the rest of the podiums came, so I always come back to São Paulo with that emotion or that memory. I was on the podium here last year too. But for me mainly it’s just… also I  remember 2015,  the first time I travelled to São Paulo for a Formula 1 race and getting to race on this iconic track. I always remember like, yeah, São Paulo, like it's happening. I played so many times on the PlayStation, but also I remember watching all the world titles being decided here when I was a kid, and I saw Lewis winning on the last lap, Fernando winning his first World Championship. It's always a track that I wanted to come to and I remember 2015, the first time I came, as a special weekend. I don't think.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it's been incredible, you know? Of course, unfortunately Checo retired on lap one but the crowd stayed and there have been amazing, so yeah, incredible! I mean, to be honest, we are experiencing an incredible season. And again today, as well of course, we had to start P3, but I think the pace of the car was very, very good. We tried to do a different strategy to everyone else and unfortunately with the red flag we couldn't really show it basically. But nevertheless on those tyres, at the end, I think we were very strong. Seventeen, 19, I don’t know! Yeah, I think that start definitely made it a bit easier for me in the first stint as well. Also, because I was going to do a two-stop, so yeah, that, of course, gave me those extra couple seconds that would look great on the plot anyway, if we would have made it happen. So, yeah, just the tyres around here, it's always very hard to manage, but I think we had quite decent pace in them. And then of course, we opted to box a bit earlier. And yeah, I think also on the Hard tyre, we were quite competitive and I closed a lot of that that pit stop back down. So yeah, I think it would have been quite interesting to the end, you know, to see how much faster I could have gone a new set of Hard tyres. Yeah, I think the strategy was looking great. But then of course, we had the red flag. So basically, everything that we did, we could throw in the bin and start over. But again, it was all about having a good start and trying to keep the lead into Turn 1, which we did. And after that it was just pace management to the end to keep the tyres alive, looking after the car, the brakes, you know, everything. No, not nervous at all. I mean, it's not the first time that I've been two-wide or three-wide into Turn 1 here. But also, I mean, we all trust each other. And of course, we're all on the limit, braking into the corner, but it was all fine, I think. But then yeah, of course, I saw on my outside that something happened. But yeah, luckily, on the inside, we could stay out of trouble. Well, for me, it was quite clear that we had to do the last stint on that Hard tyre. Luckily, it had only done one lap. So that helped. But of course in the start, normally, the Hard tyres is a bit more difficult to get off the line, but we actually had quite a decent start on that tyre as well. It's been another incredible season. I mean, the car has been unbelievable to drive in most places. So, you know, when you then, as a team, work really well together and you try not to make too many mistakes over the whole season, then you can achieve something like this. So of course, I'm very proud of the achievement, because I think after last year, when I won 15, I was like, ‘well, if I can ever try and replicate something like that, I will be very happy’ and now we are here with 16. So yeah, just very happy with everyone's performance in the team, you know, for the whole year for basically not making a lot of mistakes. No, I think it's just doing our procedures a bit better, understanding the tyre grip, it’s clutch settings. I think we just have been probably a bit more sharp on that. And I think at the beginning of the year, we had a bit of an issue but then we fixed the issue but then I think we still didn't do the right thing with tyre temperature, clutch setting. And yeah, it's all very sensitive. if you're just next to it, you might have too much wheelspin or not enough engagement. It's very difficult to get right and I think today especially it was very good. I understand because it's his home Grand Prix. You want to be on the podium, I fully understand that he went around the outside and he tried.  Looking, of course, at the footage, I think he could have left a little bit more space but on the other hand if it would have worked, you look amazing. I think it's just more that excitement of wanting to be on the podium and this time it didn't work out, unfortunately. At the time, I didn't really see a lot. At one point, I just saw that a car was a bit flying in the air, but then I saw the footage after the race and then  you can comment on it. But while driving  it's a bit hard because I was mainly focusing on Charles, because I couldn't see what was happening on the outside. No, it was just a kerb. I tried to also clip the kerb like people around me were doing but I was like a pogo stick sometimes. I tried, just trying different lines. GP’s my race engineer, but I think at one point he was trying to be the driver. We have those discussion sometimes, sometimes I'm the race engineer and then he's the driver. We just swap roles.",Mexico City,post-race,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"These guys are amazing! [indicating the crowd] Yeah, I’ve got to say a big thank you to this incredible crowd. Mexico, they've been giving us these great races here every year. And I genuinely love coming to this city. The food is fantastic and the people are beautiful. So thank you all, gracias. And otherwise, yeah, I mean, I feel fresh. We weren't having to push crazy hard out there. But this is a great result considering we started sixth. I'm really proud of the team. This is a really difficult couple of weeks and to bounce back from a difficult weekend, last weekend with the end result, this is really, really well done. Yeah, I was thinking it wasn’t going to last but I did some real sweet finesse. I was trying to drive like you! [Laughs] So far! Don’t speak too soon! But yeah, congrats to Max. Yeah, great day. I was not expecting to be up here with these guys. Difficult weekend, it started out, but yeah, I just kept my nose clean at the beginning of the race and then just really trying to manage the tyres and maximise and progress forwards. And when I noticed that I had the pace on Carlos, I knew that with the undercut, it really worked quite well. So, the team did a great job I think with strategy. And then of course the red flag probably played into our hands in terms of getting onto the fresher tyre at the end. But I just I didn't know if whether or not the Medium would make it that long. I was trying to see if I could close the gap to Max but he was long gone and I could only just about equal his times. But great result for the team, really proud of everyone. Didn't change… Well, we didn't change anything obviously since qualifying. I think the car is just quite peaky in qualifying on light fuel. But when you put a load of fuel in it, the car just handles nicer. Just nice to drive and I think we struck a really nice set-up this weekend and particularly today for the race. Then, other than that, it’s just really good tyre management. And so yeah, I generally enjoyed it. It's not the most physical of races, being that you can't push all the way, you're saving. You're doing 200, 300 metres of lift and coast to keep the car cool and stop it from failing. So, yeah, but I was I was definitely hoping maybe there'll be an opportunity to get closer to Max, but maybe next week. Yeah, for sure. I could have pushed a little bit harder but I did at one time try to see, okay, I think I've saved enough, let me see if I can try and close this gap to Max. I think it was like 10 laps to go, and I did a 22.0 and Max did a 21.9. I was like, ah, I’ll leave it. He was just cruising at 21.9. So yeah, so I thought I'd leave it there. And also, I had to be cautious, just careful because obviously my tyres… if I really pushed them for the last 10 laps, they probably would have opened up, and who knows, maybe Charles would have caught me up. So, I just had to be cautious with that. Yeah, honestly, this weekend, we've been very, very slow on the straight. In general, we've were quite draggy on the straights more often than not but this weekend, you know, like yesterday, we were losing like two-and-a-half tenths just into Turn 1 before we even start braking. So, these guys were very slippery on the straights so, trying to follow closely through Turns 16 and 17 was, was really the only way that I could get close enough and have an opportunity to make the DRS impactful. And yeah, finally, I pressed every button on the steering wheel, maximum power. And I didn't know how far across he was going to go. But split second decision, I decided to go to the right. There's just enough space there but Charles was really fair. But yeah, great racing. It definitely gives us a lot of confidence. I mean, last year, at the same time, we were doing the same thing, but last year, I think we were three-tenths behind Max in quali – or something like that, and I came second again but he walked off with it. So, we're really just mirroring what we did last year. So, we have to make some real big changes for next year. Because obviously, in Bahrain earlier this year, they’re 1.5 seconds a lap faster than us at least. So key is to make sure that's not the case in Bahrain, but I think hopefully these next couple of races will be close. But I’d probably put money on it that he’d get to 18, 19, with that car. Yeah, I mean, it's really just… it's about how much you're sliding the tyre, it's about the balance that you have. If you have too much wing in… too much front end in the car, then the car is like… imagine it a bit like a seesaw. You want to start a long stint – or a stint – with the car understeering, because as the rears go off, the seesaw tips, and then it goes to oversteer. And when it goes to oversteer, that's when you're lost most often. Unless it's the other way around, where the front tyres are the issue, for example. And, just finding that balance is very, very difficult. And it's… you go out and do your laps of the grid, for example, on a Soft tyre, it requires a different setting for the Medium tyre. And I think just really then, just focusing on all of the three sections and figuring out how to… where you can and can’t push. And I think today was just a really great balance of lift and coast and tyre saving. And it's a technique. I mean, all the drivers know about it. It's mostly dependent on Checo’s weekends really. They have the championship-winning car. He's just been unfortunate, I think, in some scenarios. Obviously I've lost quite a lot of points in the last two races but he lost points today. So it’s swings and roundabouts. I think coming into the weekend, having lost points last week, I didn't think I would really be in shooting range particularly but after today, yeah, we'll just give it our best shot. Honestly, it's not going to make a big difference to my life, whether I come second or third. It's more important to get the team second in the Constructors and so that's what I'm focused on. It's a bonus if we get second in the Drivers. Coming from a difficult race in Qatar, then having a good race in Austin really helps you leap on to the next race. So this puts us in a good position for next week. But I think the pivotal moments I think, was obviously what happened at turn one that opened up the doors a little bit for us to gain a position there, at least one position there. And I think just striking the right balance on the setup and then just making the right decisions in terms of when to push, when to try to overtake and when not to.  Tyre management was really the key. I think stopping early to get past the Ferrari. Normally here it's difficult to know whether you have an undercut or  overcut but the undercut was really quite strong. So that was their chance, they should have stopped either before us or just after us. And then after that was really the opportunity with the safety car.  Obviously we stopped earlier so I didn't know how long I would be able to take that hard tyre all the way to the end. I was a bit worried because they had seven laps younger tyres or something like that. But yeah, so when the red flag came out, I was like yeah, a bit of breathing space.",Mexico City,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"A lot of booing… A lot of booing. Guys. I mean, honestly, I had nowhere to go. So I was a bit in between the two Red Bulls and unfortunately I touched Checo, but I had nowhere to go. It’s life. It damaged my car and unfortunately it ended the race of Checo. But yeah, on our end, we maximised our race. It's life and of course I'm disappointed to end the race of Checo like that, but I really didn't do it on purpose and I had nowhere to go. Yeah, we struggled a little bit with a Hard after the restart. Lewis was really quick on the Medium and then they managed to have really good degradation. So yeah, they were just better today and it's life. Oh, well, I mean, we broke part of the front wing into Turn 1 and then on the radio, they told me that we were lacking, I think, 10 or 15 points. But to be honest, I managed to drive around it and it didn't feel too bad. So that was positive. Of course, it's never ideal to lose so many downforce points into Turn 1, but it's like this, and then we managed to do a good race from that moment onwards. But of course, it compromised a little bit our race. I think exactly the same. I mean, I had nowhere to go. I tried to stay on the right as much as possible, as close as I could to Max. But unfortunately, there was no space anymore for me to be any more to the right. I think Checo was probably not aware that I had Max on my rights and started to turn in. And when I saw that, I knew that we will collide at one point, which we did. And after that, I was extremely surprised that I could the finish the race anyway. Very pleased is not the word, because I mean, yesterday was again, a really good day, a really good Saturday. Really good pace in qualifying, but then we don't quite have the car to win races on Sunday. So, that's where we are going to try and put all our effort into for next year, in order to be better for the Sunday. I mean, it's a Sprint race. We've been pretty good at Sprint races this season. So, I hope just the same next week. No, I think it still confirms the weaknesses of our car, where it's a very peaky car. And whenever we get out of the optimal window of the car, we are losing too much time. And that's exactly what happened on the Hard. At first, I thought I could do quite a good job once we stopped. But then there was a red flag, the tyres cooled down, we went back out and the feeling was just not the same and I couldn't find the feeling again with the tyres. So it's a bit of a shame because before that it was really good, especially on the Medium. But we'll look into it, again, on the Hard to try and understand what went wrong there, in order to improve that in the future. But I think short term, there's no big fixes. I think every time we are, as I said, a bit out of the optimal window, we lose too much time. I'm not going to say the plans we had but it was quite straightforward for this race. Obviously, it's my first podium in Mexico. I think it's one of the most special podiums.  On the other hand, on a day like this, it's obviously not the most enjoyable one as there was quite a few booings once I got there. But yeah, I can understand that there's a lot of disappointments for fans that have been waiting for this moment for a whole year and then they see their favourite driver out in Turn 1, which is a shame but again, as I said on the incident, I couldn't do anything better. I'm pretty sure the car was better with a full front wing than before when we had half. On the other end, I don't know if the car is completely fine. I think also we have to check it tonight because obviously when I saw Checo with his rear wheel touching my front wheel, I was like, okay, that's done for me. And then I did two, three corners and it didn't feel too bad. Obviously, not all great but not too bad and I could finish the race. So yeah, after the red flag we could fix the front wing, but it might be that we find also some other small things that weren't in the right place.",Mexico City,post-race,Ferrari
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah! Yeah, it's been good. It's been fun. Obviously, nice achievement 200 races in the bank. This time last year, I was obviously not in a position where I saw that coming but that's how things are, how quickly things can change in F1. So, end of next year, I’m going to be close to 230s. And, you know, nice, makes me happy. I do what I like, what I'm passionate about and… happy. Yeah, but it's not the time to celebrate. It's a time to work. You know, we're still in the Championship. And, you know, none of the competition will give anything, so the usual grind really. Tough one. I felt that drove really well last Sunday, but it was like a P12-13, so, you know! It didn't really surface and show much. There’s been a lot of fun ones, good ones also. Likewise obviously some bad ones and some where I don't like to remember so much back to them, but all-in-all, you know, it's a great industry, F1, really cool environment, fun to be part of it again, especially now the second stint since the comeback this year. I've been really enjoying myself, enjoyed more, enjoyed a lot and happy to continue. Yeah, so obviously, Sprint weekend, so not an easy one for us. And then obviously, we decided to do some big set-up changes and opted for the pit-lane start which obviously, made life a bit harder for the race. But in hindsight, it was the right decision. We were more competitive on Sunday. And I think that was the first time and the first day where some positive signs and steps were seen. I think, in terms of tyre management, this was one of the best races in a while for us. So, still exploring, still finding out and learning more about the package. And I hope there's more to come as we go. But it was it was positive, let's say. What does it mean? Hopefully a better performance. I mean, it's obviously a quite different circuit here, different circumstances, you know, the usual Mexico challenges here with cooling, for car, for brakes, the thin air. It's always challenging, every year. But it's just about, you know, maximising our package and putting the best car possible on the track. Yeah, F1 is that much harder! Yeah, I had a couple of opportunities where, podium would have been possible in a non-top car. But yeah, the things happened that stopped and prevented that. And, if you're not in top cars, these opportunities don't come around that often. So, I guess I just missed out there. That's the way it is. Or I might have been illegal myself! You never know. Obviously these cars are incredibly sensitive to the ride height. The lower you get, the more downforce you get, that's the constant fight we have, and we need to find the right balance. I think Austin is a bit specific with the bumpiness and also with a lot of apex and exit kerbs where you can run them quite aggressively – but you do use the plank and wear down those shims a lot, so maybe there is something to be to be looked at in a different way. Yeah. I wasn't here last year, but I think it's more to do with which end of the pit lane you are. And I think where Alex and I are it tends to be quieter so we don't suffer the same issues. Yeah, I feel it's just a tricky, technical circuit. And you always feel like you have to under-drive a bit. You know, if you want to push too much, you very quickly pay a price and you lose more than you gain, with the sensation of low downforce that you have in the car and this low-grip feeling. So it's just about getting a clean lap in really, and as close to the limit as possible, I guess.",Mexico City,thursday,Haas
Pierre Gasly,"Well, I will say probably the whole weekend. As a whole. I think we've been executing, and getting the best out of that car every single session. So, whether it was the Qualifying on Friday, whether it was the Sprint on Saturday, or even the race, I feel like we we've left nothing on the table. And that's definitely a satisfying feeling, when you come out of a weekend where you know, you've given everything and that's pretty much the maximum you could get out of it. So, I think that's going to be the target until the end of the year. Obviously we're not fighting for anything in the Championship this season so I think it's going to be the main focus will be to just execute weekend after weekend the highest level, whether it's on the execution or getting everything out of our car. I will say the first part of the season, I quite rarely got that feeling, which we just had in Austin for example, where it felt everything was optimised and we definitely didn't leave anything on the table. I think there was a bit more unknown and getting to know each other with a team, and understanding what sort of car feedback, kind of building the relationship with the team, and everything seems to click a bit better since we got back from the Summer Break. So, I'm really happy with the progress we're making, in terms of execution, the attitude, the self-reflection on what we do every single weekend, on all areas. And I think overall, we're just making a step forward as a team, which is what we need to aim for before next season. Well, I think pretty much the same we have seen last weekend. We seem to be not quite there with the guys ahead, the likes of Mercedes, Ferrari, McLaren and Red Bull. We are not too far from Aston and we can be right in front of them if they don't get it quite right, like they did in Austin, so I think that’s going to be our main competition. If we can get in a fight with Fernando a couple of times until the end of the year, I think that will definitely be a good performance and, as I said, just maximise the opportunities. There might be a couple of good opportunities until Abu Dhabi and just need to make sure we’re there to grab them. … we were just talking about it and how stressed we are about it! I did manage to get a free golf lesson from Rory. We did a putt challenge and somehow managed to beat him. Okay, I had a hole which was pretty much double the size that he had. And yeah, that was the bet on the line: I told him okay, if I beat you, I want to free golf class from Rory and that's going to happen. I'm not sure we'll be able to do it before Vegas. But yeah, we got these big tournament coming up with Alex. I think we are in the in the worst seats at the minute compared to Lando and Carlos. So, we might get some practice together next week. We'll see. But yeah, that's definitely going to be a pretty cool experience to be on the golf course with these pro golfers. And just having Rory and Joshua last weekend in America was definitely an honour for us and great to have these guys’ support. Girlfriend! I think there's a couple of things which we could do to improve what's happened in Austin. I think starting with the Sprint weekend when we’ve got only the FP1 session on such a track. You’re doing 15 laps with quite a low amount of fuel in the car. So, to get a gauge of what you're going to get for the next 70 laps, with two Qualifyings, a Sprint race, a complete Grand Prix of 59 laps, with a lot of fuel. You’re going pretty much blind after FP1 with very few informations on where to base yourself. So, I think it's a tricky thing. Probably we can improve that process giving us more time to readjust if needed. I just remember my karting days, where you know, all top three cars were always checked. Whenever you finish on the podium, you should be checked every single time, and then on top of that, there could be random checks as well, running down the order. But yeah, I think it's been always from the past, only in F1, where it's not a standard to check all top three cars. But it was tricky, and I think the Sprint format made it even more even more tricky, considering we have a very short amount of time to set the car up. It's been good here and happy, like Yuki said, I'm happy with it. Yeah. I think I join Alex on that one. Never easy to go against probably the best driver at the moment, in combination with the best team, and a team that is fully around him. So it’s obviously a tough job. I mean, Checo did very well at the start of the season. Obviously, for some reasons, it's not going as well now – reasons we don't know. But, you know, I just wish him the best. Obviously, it's an important weekend for him in front of his own crowd, and hopefully he can get the best out of it.",Mexico City,thursday,Alpine
Alex Albon,"Pretty much! I think I have a full-time coach, which is my girlfriend, but I don't listen to her… because she's my girlfriend. So, it's going to be tricky, I think. We're trying to find some time. I don't know how Pierre’s doing but obviously a triple-header. And then we've got a week off – but that week off is normally spent travelling and doing simulator work. I'm going to struggle to get the practice in. We’re going to embarrass ourselves quite badly on international television. So, it's a lot of pressure. I think it's becoming on my mind more than the races is coming up. Which is a problem. Yeah, well, we score points in Qatar in the Sprint race, so we’ve been on, for us, what we call a bit of a run – two races in a row – the cars been feeling okay. Obviously we haven't had many upgrades for a while now. But, as Pierre touched on, a lot of it, in the midfield, because it's so tight, it's more about execution than anything else. And we seem to have a decent car and obviously, a couple of low ride-heights seemed to help us. It does make a big difference. I think when you can start off a season – I was quite lucky where I started off the season with points early on – it just settles the nerves. So, it's always that thing, where your first goal is to score points, then it would be to score a podium, and then win races, and then win championships – but you want to get the points first. That's kind-of your first checklist tick that you want to do. I'm sure it happened in a way which is not that normal, on the plane, on the way back, that you get the results given to you, but I'm sure Logan is enjoying it and can use that for some momentum for the rest of the year. Let's see, let's see. Should be an interesting weekend. Last year wasn't that good for us: low speed corners don’t tend to too well for us, and this is predominantly third gear king of style, so let's see how it goes. We've seen our car can be unexpected at times and I wouldn't want to say that we can score points this weekend but I think we can be close, and hopefully rely on some drivers and teams not optimising their packages, and then we can take over. So, all to play for. Same as Pierre and Nico. I don't think there's too much to add. I think, as Pierre touched on, what the teams have in terms of data and information to set the ride heights for the weekend is very marginal, there's not even really enough time to fill the cars up in FP1, just to get a feel for where they need to be. But on the same side, I do think, maybe you don't need to check every car, every race all the time. But, you know, if there's one, one driver in one team illegal, there's a very, very high chance that the other car, the teammate of that driver, is going to be illegal as well. So I don't know how much it would take to check a couple more cars, but I don't think that would be such an issue. But I don't know, I'm not a scrutineer. Yes, it's a tricky one. I do think we do need to make our sport as accessible as possible, so I don't see such a big issue with people being in the paddock, but I do know there's obviously limitations to it. To be honest with you, I don't think the paddock has been that bad. For me it's more been kind of just getting out of the paddock. I don't know how you guys feel, but sometimes you kind of leave the paddock and almost run over people's feet because they're kind of all coming up to your windows and everything. That stuff is maybe a little bit more touching go, but yeah, with the paddock I’m not too worried about it. I think it's always tough. I think it's tough to go against one of the best drivers on the grid and call it a generational talent to some extent, so it wasn't easy my year and I'm sure it wasn't easy for Pierre in his year. But we're drivers, you know, we go through tough times and it makes us stronger. And yeah, there's not too much to say. I think he's handling quite well, at least from what I see. So, like I said, I'm not looking over my shoulders too much and seeing see what goes on down the paddock. What format is it in Vegas? It's normal? OK. Let's see. I've already driven it on the simulator. It's hard to get proper data from there, because obviously, the track is still open to the public, so it's not as accurate as it normally is. But it's clear that it's very high speed. It feels extremely quick when you're driving on the simulator. And a lot of the corners are even flat still. So there's not so many corners, which obviously favours us. Should be four degrees, five degrees I think, which will be interesting. I wonder if we're doing three or four prep laps for qualifying, but it will be a tough one. And then again, is it going to be like Monza, where we do slipstream battles? I don't think so. But no, it should suit our car, but I don't want to put too much emphasis on it in case it doesn't turn out to be that good.",Mexico City,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"Well, I think if you let the frustration get to you, you are not looking ahead, and obviously, that's what I'm looking at, trying to get things back running like they were at the time in the year. And obviously, yes, we had quite a few DNF that cost us this this year. But, you know, it's sometimes like this in motor sport. It happens. And, yeah, we're going to be focusing on the right things this weekend, and hopefully get a good weekend under our belt. Yeah, definitely good points. Obviously, there was a huge opportunity in that race to be scoring well, especially with the few disqualification that there was ahead. But yeah, I mean, that weekend, from the Friday to the Sunday wasn't bad. It's just that things didn't turn out the right way for us. But things will turn around and come back to us. It was last year. We had points on my side. Obviously, we were performing quite well. Q3 in Quali and running strongly in the top 10 as well. I almost had a podium, couple years ago here in 2017. And, yeah, it's a track that I really enjoy. So yeah, I look forward to be driving here around. Yeah, massively! I mean, to be able to talk with these guys that have been so successful in their sports, that are joining what we want to achieve as a team. They’re basically joining us and yeah, you can talk to them and try to get good things for us as sportsmen and that's what I try to do. I'm like a big sponge when I talk to them, it's just awesome to be to be linked with these guys. And hopefully, there's going to be some awesome stuff coming up with them as well. Yeah, I’m joining these guys. I think it is an extremely difficult exercise. Just to be guessing, you know, what your ride height has to be. There is a risk and reward, obviously, in that, sort of, exercise – that if you get the car lower you get more performance, but you know, it's at the risk of are you going to be illegal with your plank. Yeah, I mean, we've seen cars changing set-up throughout the weekends because of those things. And yeah, it is just too short in FP1 really to set your car up. So yeah, I'm sure it's not the first time that there were cars illegal like that on such weekends or such a Sprint weekend. I think on normal format, it's a lot less likely to happen. But yeah, I'm sure on the other races there was as well. I think it's part of what we do, you know, to have fans, supporters and obviously more and more fans, looking at how the sport is going. I think it's a great thing. I remember seeing images of Michael in the past, who couldn't move in the paddock. I don't know how many people there was back then. But you know, that's how it's always been in a way. So I think it's just how it is as a show you know. We bring attention to the people and I think it's just cool to see some atmosphere in the paddock. I mean, if we can't move at all and get to the garage it becomes a problem but I've never seen it like that yet. So I don't think it's an issue. Yeah, I think if you are confident on braking here, it's usually a good weekend for you. You know, Turn 1 down, Turn 4 as well, there's a lot of time to gain. And it's very tricky, actually, because you are at such high speed with very low downforce that, yeah, that can make your lap gone in a second. So yeah, I think just nailing all the braking points and then not overheating your tyres too much on those braking points leaves you to good grip in the slow speed corners and good exits. So yeah, I think this is the key.",Mexico City,thursday,Alpine
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, was a good moment for us. To be honest, obviously, we got slight luck from the cars ahead. But yeah, it's big points for us, especially as we have only four races to go and we definitely close the gap to the cars in front, which is really good. And yeah, last fastest lap was… I enjoyed a lot with the you know, last fresh tyres on the Soft. Mostly in a race, you're managing the tyres, and now you can go flat out. So yeah, it was a cool moment and I think we got a good motivation for now. Extra motivation from that point. And yeah, I think we ready for the rest of the races. Yeah, I think that helps a lot. But at the same time, we kind of spread the strategy to try to maximise the race. We knew that it's going to be difficult to the score points in US. Sprint Qualifying, turns out it’s actually quite good race pace – but like Alex and Nico says, it’s all about execution. So didn’t probably maximise that on Saturday, so that's the only things that we have to improve for the future – but every details, every feedback from him, definitely gives us a step forward as a team. Obviously it would be nice if we’re able to be top eight – but it won’t be easy. I think Alpine are consistently in recent races quite fast, so it won’t be easy – but anything can happen, like we saw at previous races. Two points sounds quite small but it’s not actually close. You need to maximise every race week – but we’re feeling optimistic. Looking forwards. I think our package is getting closer and closer towards P10, which is good. We just have to put it all together, every race. Yeah, pretty much aligned to everyone. But we got a prize from the previous race. So, so far, I don't have to change I think.",Mexico City,thursday,RB
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it's very different. You know, it's the weekend that you want to be perfect, the weekend that you want to maximise your result. And if there's one particular grand prix that you want to win it’s your home Grand Prix? Yeah, it's great. I mean, luckily, I had Austin before, so we weren't that busy. Only yesterday, we did have a lot of events. But now it's just a normal weekend, you know, and at the end of the day, it's a weekend that counts the same as any other weekend in terms of points. So yeah, it goes in hand. I think once I'm in the car, it's a lot easier. It's very easy, it comes natural. But when you are out of the car, or even in the paddock, you see the attention is very different, you know. A lot of eyes on you and a lot of support from the crowd. Ha! It would be insane! That obviously will be my biggest dream, you know, to achieve that this weekend. So now full focus on tomorrow, the practice, and try to get a perfect weekend here. Yeah, definitely. We made a lot of progress. Unfortunately, we didn't really get to show the full potential we have, you know, with the Sprint event we ended up taking the wrong direction with the car. Like a lot of people did, even Mercedes, Ferrari, you know. It's what happens in those sorts of events. So we ended up just taking the wrong direction with it. And I believe that we made some really good progress. Not even in Spain, you get this sort of crowd eh? You need that your Spanish friend to push it up. No, not at all. And I think it's important that we give this message, because I think media likes to create this sort of rivalry outside the track and I think we are a great sport. We are a great example for a lot of young generations and we should just be focused on the sport side. And whatever happens on track should always stay there and that's the best message we, as a country, want to give to the rest of the world. And yeah, there is nothing else going on. The most important thing is that everything stays on track. Well, I think obviously, we are all rivals but at the same time we are all sports athletes, and we all want to do the best for ourselves. Max and myself, we are in the same team so we both want to win and we are all giving our best so I don't think that there should be any rivalry. For example, if I'm fighting in the race with Fernando, he's not my rival out of the track, it's just that we are just fighting on track. But like I say, the media likes to create this rivalry out of the track which I don't think is right and it's important for the fans to understand that. No, I'm happy that I'm here. And you know, every race is a different sort of challenge. But at the end of the day, I'm really happy, I'm really happy to be in my country and I'm prepared to give my very best this weekend. Speed-wise? Well, sometimes when we do some activations with a sponsor and we got to off-road, I enjoy that, going off-road in big cars, that’s a very different sort of speed, but it's also very enjoyable. No, I think that's for Fernando. No, I don't think I go for that. I think we’ve got to appreciate, obviously, the Mexican fans are really enthusiastic. But at the same time, we have to make sure that the drivers are comfortably going around the paddock, and I think that that should be a nice balance. And I just want everyone to have a great time in my country and I think that's something that went over the limit last year, that hopefully this year can be improved, because overall, it's in my opinion, like the best reception for all the drivers in the world. I think that the gap in Austin was a lot smaller than it really showed, finishing the fight on the race. I think we were all within a tenth, maximum two tenths, the top five, top six cars. So I think we just lost some direction with the sprint event but we definitely made some good progress. And we understood… I said that after Qatar that we had a very good few days back in the factory, that we went really deep on the detail and we understood a lot of things that we were trying to compensate for our issues that actually were making the basically the result worse. So I believe that we are back in contention. Yeah, it will be my biggest dream to manage to get the victory at home. And then like I said before, it's great to be at home, especially towards the end of the season. You don't get the opportunity to see your friends that often, a lot of your fans so it's a weekend where I get to see them all. And I'm just ready to give it all and hopefully it works out. It's really difficult, like George just mentioned. I think if he was saving some fuel and brakes in Austin, here, it's even more intense, especially if you're in traffic on Sunday with the altitude, there's a lot of management that we’re going to have to do on Sunday, just to see the finish line. So yeah, it's not so easy also to fight, to overtake and strategy, it's very likely that it will be a one stop so in that regard, qualifying is really important. For me, personally, no. Nothing compares to being in Mexico. Being in the States gets close but no, not even. The reception and the passion of the fans that I have here doesn't compare to anywhere else in the world.
FA: Yeah, Spain is not bad but Mexico is up there on the podium.",Mexico City,thursday,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, it was it was a surprise. I mean, they told me before leaving the hotel that they were 4,000 people at the mall. And it was true. I mean, I didn't believe it, but yeah, it was incredible. The enthusiasm about this race here in the city is very nice to see. And we have this incredible welcome from everyone. So we are just enjoying every minute here and we want to put a good show on Sunday and people celebrate hopefully a good result. There are less people, less people. Optimising the set-up. I think on Sprint weekends, you have that risk of, you know, having only one session, where you have to optimise everything on the car. We had a very difficult session in FP1 with a lot of brake problems. And yeah, we opted to change the set-up, optimise a little bit everything, the package, and start from the pit lane. And that was a nice result for us, good information that we got from Austin. And yeah, I think the pace that we saw on Sunday, it was a combination of being optimized on our side and maybe, as Checo said, I think our main opponents were not optimized, having only FP1. So it was the same for everybody and we took the opportunity to have a better Sunday. Not totally clear. I think it is a completely different track with different needs. So I think we will use the full practice this time. After a few Sprint events we are, you know, more relaxed now and happier that we have FP1, FP2, FP3 to optimise things. So it's going to be the same for everybody. But yeah, we really need these three practices that are coming in the next days. Correct. I was! I was, because I think I've been playing paddle for, I don't know, 15 years, 12 years or something like that. But I think George is quite new into that and he was strong. And we are unbeatable at the moment! You know, we play once and its 100% dominant wins! No, I think it has been more consistent feeling and season than what maybe the results are showing. I think we've been balancing always the ups and also the downs. We've been always very focused on the performance of the car and tried to get better as a team. Two years ago, this organisation was 250 people and now we are just a few points away from the very top teams in the Constructors’ championship and as you said, tasting the podium for a few times already this year. We have this new factory as well, a lot of new people that came to the team. I think around 200 points more than last year. So it has been an incredible 2023 campaign for Aston Martin. I know that we are more and more like football here and only the last result seems to count but we cannot forget where we come from and what the project is about so very proud of this season so far. Hopefully we can finish on a high; in the remaining races we can taste the podium one more time at least and then go into 2024 I think with a lot more confident than this year. I think we started the winter just hoping that the project was taking the right direction after a difficult 2022. We learn a lot of things throughout the season, a lot of things also off-track, development on the car during the season, direction of development. So it has been a very important championship not only for the results itself, also for the team to get a contender for the future. So it has been a very important season and I'm very proud and happy I don't think it does change too many things to be honest. On the championship, or as a sport, it's just the number of races that they just increased. So some of those extra races now are held on street circuits for basically different interest and try to grow as a sport. So we embrace that change as well and we try to help this sport as much as I can and everyone is doing the same.",Mexico City,thursday,Aston Martin
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, actually, it was for example… Austin was actually the best start we have done this season in terms of just Friday with one practice session. We managed to get the car in a very nice window. But then, yeah, we were expecting to pick up a little bit quicker the pace – like the other few races, we've been stronger on Sunday, than maybe Friday or Saturday in quali. But Austin was completely opposite way round. So it was quite surprising, actually, with the amount of lack of speed on Sunday. So we didn't really have the car to be fighting for points, unfortunately, after let's say, a pretty good, P12, P13 start on the grid. I mean, it's very nice to have a weekend back to normal, finally. I think for everyone. That we really need to understand a bit more with all this package we have and for all the teams and to have the extra two sessions that really helps to understand a lot more, so we can try different sets-ups, making sure that we can optimise everything before the qualifying session. And it's going to be super important also… I feel like, you know, the steps we were able to do throughout the season were in the right direction, but we weren’t able to keep the consistency like some of the other competitors was able to do. Yeah, actually, it was, last year here I remember it was the best race weekend we had for the second half of the season because we struggled a bit more towards the end of the season. And the car seemed to be quite strong, especially with the low-grip tracks, and also these low-speed conditions. So we really want to work on that and try to focus on being back in the points because I feel like if some race weekends you can be fighting for points quite comfortably, then there's no reason other race weekends you struggle a lot more. So yes it’s about optimizing the set-up before quali and everything will just come. Yeah, last year was pretty chaotic in the paddock in general. And can you imagine if you are Fernando or Checo and it's going to be fully packed and I think today's actually being not too bad so let's say the weekend but it's great to have let's say, all the passion that they have as a Mexican fans, but also in the other time you have to give drivers some room, especially we’re to try to give them a very good show, trying to work as hard as we could.",Mexico City,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Oscar Piastri,"Yes, I went to New York for a few days. Seeing some of our partners, some of our investors as well, which was nice. You know, obviously, a lot of our partners and investors are based in this part of in this part of the world, so yeah, nice to catch up with them before coming here. Yeah, you're right. It was a tough weekend. You know, it just took me longer than I wanted to get up to speed. I think as I went through the weekend, I was getting better and better. And Sunday was looking pretty good. Had a good start and then we unfortunately had to retire. But yeah, definitely one of the weekends where I'll learn the most and try and work on that for the next few weekends. Not particularly. Not like some other circuits have. In saying that, I think Austin was maybe better than our expectations in terms of performance. But yeah, we'll have to wait and see. It's a very different circuit here. It's my first time here. So there'll be a lot of learning for myself to do. But yeah, hopefully we can still be in the fight with the teams we’re around. So which corner will be the most challenging? OK. I think here there's a lot of the challenging parts. I think obviously the run to turn one is extremely long and getting the braking point right will be difficult. The stadium section is very, very slow and easy to make a mistake there. I think that the whole track is difficult and obviously the altitude is very high here so the grip is quite low. So it just makes everything difficult but I'll have a better answer for you tomorrow.",Mexico City,thursday,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, it was OK. Team-mates on the paddle court, 100% record against our competitors. So it’s always nice to do that as a sport, I’ve been getting into it a little bit as this year has progressed, and especially this time of the season, you spend a lot of time away, so it's nice to have a little hobby on the side. I think it's a very different layout here. Obviously, with the one session in Austin, we did all of the standard checks after FP1 and the plank looked absolutely fine. So there was no reason after the practice session to make any changes, but obviously we got that very wrong. I expect the nature of this circuit to be naturally more conservative and with the three practice sessions, I don't foresee any issues there. Yeah, definitely the upgrades were performing really well and I think that was clear with the performance. We had some limitations on my side. I had not enough fuel and was having to manage the fuel for half of the race. That really put me on the back foot but the last stint, we just went for it and the pace was probably the strongest out there which definitely bodes well for the end of the season. It shouldn't be a problem. I can't think of any corners that are going to be a limitation. I think Turn 2 there was a bit of a problem last year with some drivers cutting it. But it's circuits like this that you want to be racing on where there isn't an opportunity to be pushed off but still take the advantage. So yeah, I think Austin, Austria, I can't think of any others now but these types of circuits lend itself to that. Yeah, the car was performing really well last year on paper. I'd say this circuit suits us better than the likes of Austin and Qatar and Japan, on which we were still pretty competitive too so I wouldn't say we have high hopes here but I think it should suit a slightly better. Bit of an unknown going to the C5 compound this year compared to the C4 last year but we're feeling optimistic going into these two races. Yeah, I think for me, the more the merrier is great but at the end of the day, we're all here to do a job. And last year, we were struggling just to get from our engineers’ office to the garage without people jumping on us and sticking cameras right in our face. It was a bit of a strange environment. So yeah, I'm happy for the paddock to be packed as long as we've all got a sensible way through to get to where we’ve got to be. It's a very difficult scenario to find yourself in because as racing drivers you want to drive as fast as possible, every single lap and that's why often qualifying is quite straightforward because you don't need to overthink it. You're just pedal to the metal and you go for it whereas, now you're going into turn one, if you've got a bit of traffic, you probably can't hit the brakes as hard as you'd like to because the brakes will go through the roof. You can't probably follow cars for a number of laps in a row because of the engine overheating, so having to lift off the throttle maybe 100 metres before every single braking zone makes it feel quite unnatural to drive. Because when you grew up as a kid, eight years old driving a go-kart, these are techniques that you'd never use and the same, to be honest, in Formula 3, Formula 2, you'd never find yourself implementing these techniques to cool the engine down, to cool the tyres down, to cool the brakes down because those race cars aren't probably pushed to the limit as a Formula 1 car is so it's definitely a bit strange, but it's what you have to do to find the best compromise.",Mexico City,thursday,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"I don't know. I think as a team we did a great job. I mean, we know that in the Sprint weekend it's more important than ever to have a clean FP1. We did. We had a good FP1. We started with a strong basis thanks to the work the guys have done to prepare this weekend, with the car straightaway feeling good. And yeah, then I was feeling good and the lap, I was happy throughout qualifying. The last lap in Q3, there was a bit of mistakes here and there. But I think it wasn't easy for everybody. So yeah, really happy. We're starting on pole for Sunday. I mean, of course, into Turn 1 it's always tricky here. But at the same time, it's always better to be starting in the front rather than being in the back. So I'm really happy and I love this track. I love the vibe that is around the track in the city and in the country. So it's great to be here. So from the first lap, we built up the confidence. I built up the confidence with the car and I felt good straightaway. So then in qualifying, I tried to put everything together. The first lap in Q3 felt quite a bit better than the second lap. But I think there was a bit of track improvement. And the second lap was good enough for pole, even though we are on track we got beaten by Max, but his lap time was deleted later on. But very happy anyway to be on pole. It's a surprise for us, we definitely did not expect to be fighting for pole position here. I don't think anymore. I stopped thinking a long time ago, because this year, I cannot quite understand where we are. Yeah, it's very difficult to anticipate where you're going to be during the weekend. So for now, we are just focused on ourselves. The car felt good. So yeah, and then I was positively surprised anyway, because even if everything felt really good, I did not expect to be fighting for pole. It's very bumpy here. And the car definitely felt good on bumps today, which gives you quite a bit of confidence to push in all the high speed, which normally is our weakness, but maybe because our car was good on those bumps, we could at least match the others. And then our car was strong in the medium and low speeds. So again, it's very difficult to understand where you're going to be coming into a weekend. But for some reason, this weekend, we are the strongest until now, which is good. Yeah, but very different characteristics. But it's a good sign. I think we've learned a massive amount since the start of the second part of the season. We haven't brought massive upgrades since then but we learned how to maximise our car. And that helped us to be a bit more regularly at our 100%. And today is once again the proof. So it's a good time for the future. I mean, the first one was much cleaner. I put more or less everything together. The second lap was a bit more let's go for it and see what happens. And when you have this kind of mentality, then you have a bit more mistakes. But all in all, I gained more by taking risks than what I've lost with a small mistake. So it was just a bit more difficult to put everything together once I started really pushing in that last lap, but it paid off. So I'm happy. Well, all in all, it's exactly what I've been complaining about since the beginning of the season, where we have a car that is very inconsistent, once we get oversteer, we lose a lot of overall grip and this upgrade was exactly for that. And that helped us or that helped me to gain a bit more confidence and to set up the car in a way that I prefer. And to have a bit of a stronger front, which normally is something that I enjoy. So yeah, I just feel more at ease with the car since then. But there's still quite a few races left. And there's still quite a lot of work to do. So we need to keep pushing, but we did some steps forward for sure. I just had a heart attack, because my engineer told me track limits and then… for Verstappen. And when I heard track limits, yeah, I punched my steering wheel and my helmet, and then I heard for Verstappen and then I was ‘OK, that's a better news for us’. So no, that's why I, in the moment, I just said to Xavi, ‘please tell me the name before the track limits, just so I don't get too excited’. And that's it. Oh, for sure. As always, but Red Bull is always very strong. And obviously Max this year is always on it. So yeah, for sure he will be a threat and up there tomorrow (sic). It changed a lot. I mean, especially for me, but it's not really fair to do a compare. I mean, five years ago, it was my second year in Formula 1 maybe, but also Formula 1 was not as known as what it is today in the US. So the change is massive. In Austin, we could go around and nobody would recognise us. Now it's a bit more difficult to go around. But it's a good thing. Formula 1 is growing everywhere. And I think where we felt the most difference is definitely here in the US.",United States,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Yeah, I'm happy it's been a good day. Like you said, probably not expected from the end result, so a good bonus for the whole team. I didn't make as many mistakes as I made last week, which is a good thing. I think we had it today. I think there was enough in it to get pole. I know Charles said he made a few mistakes, but so did I, so it's a bit of a shame. That one opportunity maybe we missed again but I'm still happy nevertheless. I mean, it's different every year. But like you said, you never know. That’s always the thing here in COTA , you never know what can happen. But we're in a good position. Charles is normally a good starter, to be honest, so it's going to be difficult to get him off the line. But we’re in almost the best position you could ask for Sunday, so I'm happy with that. No, I think when you realise where Max probably should have been in terms of overall pace, I still think the Red Bulls probably close to being the quickest. And I didn't expect to beat Ferrari, so I think we're in probably the position we expected to be. Probably closer to pole than I was expecting. I think there was still that little chance to potentially get it today. So probably similar to Charles, you know, pleasantly surprised to be sitting here in the top three, first of all, but then especially in P2. So a good day for us. A little bit surprising, you know, because we know mainly the slow speed is a normally a big weakness for us, and there's less high speed here comparing to Qatar and things like that. So I'm happy with today. Silly question. You don't know that. If I just did a good lap, maybe then that could have been pole. I just made a few mistakes. I'm sure a lot of people made mistakes today. It's not an easy track to put it all together just bad tarmac in areas and slippery and wind in certain corners, bumps. So I think just a lot of things going on, so still to be sitting here, I'm happy with that. Cool. No, it doesn't change anything. I don't like these stats, they don't mean anything. Yeah, Turn 11, that’s where it all went wrong, I think the rest… maybe a little bit the last corner. Turn 11, we've been struggling a little bit with just consistency of car and braking performance. And the car just turned a bit better than I was expecting. And I mean, I braked later, but then the car also rotated better. So I was expecting to almost miss the apex a bit more. And I ended up just clipping the kerb. And when you clip the kerb in 11 it's the run the whole way down the straight that you lose. So it's just a half a tenth mistake initially, because you get on power a bit later. But then because you get on power later, you lose easily another half a tenth or sometimes more all the way down to Turn 12. The rest of the lap, apart from maybe the last corner was, I think, very strong. I was very happy with Turn 1 and Sector 1. Just two places I feel like I probably lost it today. Not much more to add. I guess I've been here since 2018, since I made coffee for Fernando – 2017 or 2018. So it's changed a lot, just the atmosphere. I mean, the people are great, the fans and you know, the energy that everyone brings is always very good. I enjoy coming here. I enjoy the week here, there's plenty of things to do, plenty of nice golf courses and things, you know. So it's good fun, good food. But it's grown massively. And a lot of it's down to, of course, Netflix and things like that. So for that to be happening and even like the Netflix event we got in Vegas is going to be cool. So plenty of things have come from just F1 getting closer and I know it doesn't look it always when Max has dominated like he has, but I think for the rest of it, you take the Red Bulls out of it, the battle you would have between Mercedes., Ferrari, now us, Aston at the beginning of the year, I think it would be a very, very exciting season. And I think that's exactly what the fans want. So I'm sure it's only going to continue to be like that the more we as teams improve.",United States,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"I love being in the States. Look at this weather we've got. It’s such a beautiful country and this circuit is just incredible. It's one of the drivers’ favourites, definitely one of my favourites. This is right up there with Silverstone. It really is a legendary layout that I think every driver finds really tricky. It’s bumpy, incredibly challenging, each section. So yeah, these guys, I have to say a big thank you to everyone back to the factory, they've been pushing so hard to you know, improve our car and we have taken a bit of a step closer to these guys this weekend. Which I know everyone's working so hard for. So I really do appreciate all their efforts and unfortunately they are still a little bit ahead, but we'll give it another shot tomorrow. I'll give it my best shot for sure. And with this crowd I think anything is possible, so we'll give it a go. Yeah, good session for us. Really grateful for the improvements that the team have made with the car. Everyone's worked so hard to bring some upgrades and for us to be this close to McLaren and Ferrari and even the Red Bulls. I think it's a showing of just how hard everyone's worked. The car it feels almost the same. It's just levelled up in pretty much everywhere. Too early to say. None of us have done any long running. So I have no idea. Maybe with the Red Bull not in the top three, maybe that makes it a better, closer battle maybe, because they're often quite a bit ahead and just disappear into the distance. So hopefully the three of us can have a tight battle. I mean, all of us are pushing to finish first. So I think it will be just a showing of really, you know, resilience and strength and depth from our team. I think we had a difficult year last year. And even with the start to this year, we didn't expect to be where we are. So to be fighting for second in the Constructors and obviously trying to hold that position to these two guys. And, yeah, I mean, I don't know whether or not we'll catch Sergio but given the difference of our cars throughout the season, I'm really proud of the work that we've done. We've just got to keep our heads down, keep fighting, keep pushing. There's a lot of, like Charles said, they've have a lot of work to do, as we do. So it's a race for development and it's who can get the top of the mountain first for next year, I guess. I don't know really if it's a signifier of anything for next year. As we continue to experiment, we get more and more knowledge of where we are going, where we are routing the flow of the car. The floor is not a huge amount different, so it's… There's always hype with someone's upgrade, but the rest of the car is exactly the same and there's lots of areas in which we can improve. But this is an improvement. This is one of the first upgrades that I've actually felt over the last two years. So that's, that's a positive and we just need two or three times this step to put us in, you know, super competitive mode, which I believe the guys can do. Yes, it’s an incredible community that we have here, I think. I mean, I've been here since the beginning in 2012. Already back then we had an amazing crowd. But there's a different… I think the people that were coming were more so new to it, maybe. But there's just a different energy, a different excitement, even bigger than before, and it's growing every year and it's something that you can really feel and it's great to share that love and that passion for a sport that you've grown up with for so long with this great country.",United States,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was quite tight. But luckily, there's a lot of space going into Turn 1, so that definitely helps. But yeah, after that, we could do our own race, control the pace a bit. And then, yeah, I had a bit of fun at the end, pushing a bit more. Yeah, I mean, it was always like eight or nine tenths for a few laps, so that was all controllable into the braking zone. But yeah, the DRS, with such big wings here on this track, they're quite powerful, you know and once I cleared the DRS, then we all settled in our own rhythms and I think the pace of the car was very good today. I do need it tomorrow, yeah! Starting P6 is going to be a bit different than today. But it makes it interesting and hopefully we can have a bit of fun out there tomorrow, few overtakes. And of course, we want to win. The capacity is unbelievable. You know, the crowd here is getting bigger and bigger every single year, you almost don't see the hill anymore over there. No, it's always great to be here. Yeah, the start was of course, important. It was not too bad, I think from pole here. Of course, it got quite close into Turn 1, but luckily Turn 1 is quite wide, so you can enter with a few cars if needed. And from there onwards, I think the first few laps, Lewis was pushing to stay in the DRS and trying to have a go. And once I basically cleared the DRS I just focused on my own pace and tried to look after the tyres. And I couldn't maintain basically that pace and I think that was quite important today. Yeah, I mean, I guess Charles had a little bit of a better start, so I tried to make it as difficult as possible for him to get into Turn 1 and luckily, that worked out. Yeah, I mean, of course, it's not ideal to start P6. But the pace of the car seems quite strong, and hopefully on higher fuel loads tomorrow, we can do something similar. But you know, it's one thing to be faster, but we have also to try and get by a few cars this time. So with the deg around here that's not going to be straightforward, trying to follow also through the high speed, but yeah, we have a race on our hands, I think. No, he’s, just like normal, keeping me up to date, telling me a few things to look at. Yeah, like normal. Needs a USB drive on my car! That's my start guy. I mean, the poor guy has had a few tough races. So, I was just joking like that it wasn't too bad this time. We go to Brazil? Yeah, no, I know! Yeah, well last year… that’s the problem with the sprint format. If you make a mistake with the set-up, you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend. And that's something that I don't like. So that was the case last year. So, I'm quite confident that we can do a better job this time. Love it. It's fantastic! If you want my honest opinion about the sprint weekends, I don't really get excited by it. In qualifying, I just feel like once you complete qualifying, you're a bit lost. I feel like we only need one qualifying in the weekend where you really put everything on the line and it feels great. This morning as well, like you put it on P1 but I'm like it’s a Saturday, there’s not many points anyway for the race. And besides that, like now, we've done this race, everyone more or less knows what's going to happen tomorrow between all the cars in terms of pace, so that takes a bit the excitement away from it. If we wouldn't have done today and we only had that qualifying that we had yesterday, you don't really know what's going to happen before the race, so everyone is very excited, turning on the TV because you don't know and also we didn't know. Now we know, a little bit. So… I’m not bored but if I would be a fan, I would just be disappointed because then you more or less know about the picture. If nothing crazy happens, you know what's going to happen tomorrow so I find that a bit… it takes away that magic of waking up on a Sunday morning or whatever, Sunday afternoon, and you turn on the TV and you’ve had qualifying but you're not sure which car is going to be quickest in most of the years and yeah, it takes that magic away, I find Yeah, bigger crowds especially here. In Austin we saw the effect of pre- kind of popularity and now, where, a couple of years ago, you could just drive back to the hotel within 20 minutes, 25 minutes, no problem. You could go out for dinner, no problem, you could walk around, no problem whereas now, driving back to the hotel takes you 40 minutes, 45 minutes. There are so many fans in the city. They really love it. It's a massive crowd next to the track. So yeah, it has grown a lot and I think that's, of course, great to see of course here but of course also like Miami, you can see the crowd and I can only imagine what Vegas will be like so yeah, it's good to see that. Yeah, I do think that the kerbs are bit… sorry, more easy to judge in general, especially in the very fast corners. In the very low speed, I think the white line hasn't been a massive issue but in some corners, judging on such a small white line is tough, and yesterday, of course, it caught me out. But yeah, I do feel that we need to come up with something different because it is tricky. You don't make these kinds of mistakes, of course on purpose. I think today with that double kind of white line, that already helped a bit. But yeah, we'll keep talking to the FIA to see what we can do.",United States,post-sprint,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I didn't hear a single word you just said. It was because the crowd were sounding so great. So, thank you everyone for the amazing support. That was a fun race. Good start down to Turn 1, and a good battle with Charles. And then I was trying early on to get closer to Max. But their pace is just undeniable at the moment. But I'm happy we’re a little bit closer. We’ve still got a long way to go to be able to eke the pace that he was doing throughout the race. But nonetheless, I'm really happy to be back on the podium. Yeah, I think that will be helpful for us at the front. I mean, ultimately, I think he will be breathing down our necks before too long, with the pace that he had today. But I think that will open it up for a good fight with Charles and Lando, we're all quite similar in pace. So hopefully we get to have a good battle tomorrow. And if we can all keep Max behind that’d be awesome. But if not, no worries. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Yeah, it started… I didn't get that great a start but obviously quite aggressive Turn One and had a good battle with Charles. But then, after that, yeah, the car was feeling pretty good so I was just attacking from the get-go, trying to get as close as I could while the car felt like that. I just couldn’t bridge the gap enough to Max. And then once I was out of his DRS, then he just started eking away and cruising. So, it was a really… not that I haven't seen it already this year, we haven't seen it, obviously, but it was a good position to be able to watch what the the Red Bull’s car what Max’s car was doing, how it was behaving. So, I got to watch for a while and see where they are particularly strong, which we can obviously see that on GPS or something like that, but still, least to know where we are, if there's any where we're stronger, and where we’re weaker, so I can download that to my team. And at the end, I think everyone's tyres was struggling towards the end of that stint. That’s what we need, is a USB! I was trying to get close enough. Next time I’ll get one of those GoPro sticks! But… that we have a lot of work to do. Everyone behind these guys have a lot of work to do. And it's no small feat for us to truly catch them for next year. They will be progressing at a steep rate as they've got an amazing development team. And to make it even steeper for us to be able to close that gap. But I’m going to put 100% faith in my team that we can do it Honestly, I couldn’t see him, going into the corner. I had one of the McLarens alongside me. So that's all, I was just trying not to have a repeat of last race. And then all of a sudden, I seem to come out of the corner and then I saw Charles there – and I was just hoping I was able to pull-up alongside him, and race him, and we were racing all the way down to Turn Three. He was like in my blind spot, so I was a little bit worried at that point. And then, once I was past him, I was just trying to get onto… it was really good, just to be up at the front with these guys. They’re incredibly talented, and both still have such bright futures ahead of them, so to be out there racing against strong drivers like this is what every driver dreams of. Anything's possible. It depends. I mean, he's got at least half a second on all the cars ahead of him per lap, pretty much. So that should be enough to get by. But there is degradation and those sorts of things and strategy, I assume he will be climbing relatively fast. So, we will have a job on our hands up ahead to try and hold him back. But it's a track that you can overtake, so it is likely that he will be finishing high up tomorrow. With the pace they have, as I said, they've got half a second here, they're going to have at least three tenths by that race. We're not in the same league as them at the moment so we're not in shooting… I mean maybe to get second or third but if Max is on form, there's no chance. Sounds like you’re a bit bored. It’s a slightly different perspective when you're chasing so for us it's fun. For me, it's fun. I like having the extra opportunity to get out there and try to squeeze everything, every little bit and more out of the package that we have. Can it be better? I'm sure we can learn. I think it's been exciting for people so I personally quite like the sprint weekends, particularly a Friday I really like where you only have one practice session and then you’re straight into qualifying.",United States,post-sprint,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"Oh, yeah. I mean, there was an opportunity, there was a gap and I tried, but obviously then it was tight and I lost the position to Lewis, but they were a bit stronger today in race pace. We expected them to be stronger and they were, so we need to work to try and understand what we can do better to be a step ahead tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, at the end we have quite a lot of data to analyse having the two cars on two different strategies. I think this will be a bit of a help for us because we know how the Softs are behaving for tomorrow, so I hope we can take advantage of that and yeah, hopefully we can win tomorrow. It was nice! I mean, I had a good start so then I saw a little gap on the left. Very little. I tried to go for it and then it was very tight into Turn One. I unfortunately lost momentum by fighting Max and Lewis will get alongside me. Then I still tried around the outside of Turn Two, which was quite tricky with cold tyres, and then getting to Turn Three, there was no way for me to keep going without colliding with Lewis. So, I just left off. And then it was very difficult from that moment onwards, because we lost quite a bit straightaway in the first lap, then we didn't have the DRS and then I was just doing my own race. And the Mercedes, I mean, Lewis and Max, were too strong, especially in the first few laps. Then towards the end, we were more on the pace of Lewis, but it was too late. He was too far! I couldn't see his car – but I've got the GPS. I always look very carefully at the GPS. You can already see quite a lot of things also through the onboards. So, it's not too much of a disadvantage. Yes, we struggled a little bit with the tyre. So, that we really need to work on for tomorrow because this is going to be key for tomorrow's race. And we seem to struggle mostly with the rear tyres towards the end of the race. So, we'll look into that. We've got tonight to work on it and to try and understand what we can do better for tomorrow, even though we cannot change the car. And let's see. To be honest, I would have done exactly the same if I was in his position. So, it's on the limit but as I've always said in the past, that's the way I like to fight. So, this today didn't play on my way but that's fine. It's part of racing, and I'm happy with it. Yeah, I think there are some things that are nice, others that are a bit less nice. What I enjoy is the Friday to only have one free practice and to go straight into qualifying. This is something that as a driver I like because you need to… FP1 then becomes a real session. Normally in a normal race weekend, FP1, FP2, FP3 it's really plenty of laps before you get to qualifying, which is maybe a bit too many. On these weekend's I quite like it. But then there are maybe other things that we need to look into. I think in Qatar it was very exciting, the sprint race, because we had two compounds that were very different. So one that was extremely good in the first six, seven laps and then had a lot of degradation. And the other that was really good towards the end of the race. And that makes the sprint race really exciting. Otherwise, we've got races like today where everybody, apart from Carlos unfortunately, uses the Medium and then it's a bit of a shame. It's going to be tight, as much as it's going to be tight also with the Mercedes guys and Lewis. I expect Max to get ahead and to not be too much of a fight but then otherwise it's going to be tight. I think we have to look into our data and try to understand what we can do better for tomorrow's degradation because the pace is there, it's always been there, sometimes we seem to be a bit inconsistent with our race pace. Today was the case, we struggled more than others and we'll try to understand what's wrong and see if we can do anything different for tomorrow to help that.",United States,post-sprint,Ferrari
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, a lot for sure. It's a very good track for me with Williams; obviously joined the Driver Academy here in 2021, did my first FP1 here last year. And it's the first car track in America that I've ever driven so it's nice to be back and nice to be back in an F1 car.",United States,thursday,Williams
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, it was hot, for sure. I think we all felt it. It took me a good few days after the race to feel 100% again.",United States,thursday,Aston Martin
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I just wear whatever they tell me to wear but if you guys like, I like it. Yeah, I've been also trying to recover from Qatar but not so much physically because I didn't race but mentally from not being able to take part in that race, which, in hindsight, actually, there was a race to miss probably Qatar, looking back and looks like a good one to maybe skip. But yeah, it's been a couple of days in New York with an event and getting to see the city for the first time. I had never been, believe it or not. It's been nine years on the road, travelling the world in F1 but I had never stopped in New York before so I got a couple of days there. Big, quite a bit of traffic, love the restaurants, loved Central Park but now in Austin ready to focus on what matters, at least trying to get hopefully back in the podium this weekend. I was an interested observer but obviously looking at strategy and looking at… I was constantly looking where I would have been? Like the brain is always going to this race trace and saying I would have been here with my strategy, I would have tried to do this, this and then you just realise that it's not worth it because you get even more frustrated and you start thinking what if, what if, what if? Yeah, it was frustrating from a driver's perspective to watch the race from the barriers but it's how it goes. And yeah, hopefully looks like we will get a bit of a heat experience also here in Austin. Yeah, I love this track, I love how this place becomes on Saturday, Sunday with the fans and how cool it is to drive it. So yeah, I'll hopefully forget Qatar soon. No, we've changed a lot of parts in the car to try and obviously correct the issue that affected us in Qatar. We are trying also to find solutions in the long term, not only in the short term because it's definitely something that we are not happy with and we've also had issues in the past so yeah, a bit of a headache that is giving us this fuel tank now and then but yeah, we will try and put it back together this weekend and hopefully shouldn't be any issues anytime soon. I think if we don't have any other DNS or DNFs, I think we should be able to keep them behind. Doesn't mean that they're not going to beat us. I think they're going to beat us in most of the races from here to the end of the season, if all things are aligned because they do have a very quick car nowadays and they look to be the only ones that can at certain times bother Red Bull and as we are in a track like Singapore, where maybe it's more us. But yeah, I don't know. I was playing golf yesterday with Lando and we were discussing whether they will be ahead this weekend, we will be ahead. Maybe qualifying, maybe race but basically we don't know. So let's see tomorrow. We didn't compete in the end. But it was fun. We played 12 holes in Sunset so it was good fun. I like from the outset, I like the three stop race. I didn't like that it was restricted to a number of laps because you could predict when everyone was stopping so I think there's some aspects of that race that looked interesting, like how much the drivers had to push and how many times you had to go through pits to then come back to the field a bit and find yourself in traffic and having to overtake but having the restricted laps on each tyre was… If you knew which tyre was everyone on you knew which lap they were going to stop. So almost there was not as much flexibility on the strategy as it looked from the outside. So yeah, hopefully the future is more on the side of pushing a bit more but two/three-stop races. Normally the best races in F1 are when it's just on the gap between a one and a two stop, like maybe we saw Suzuka or the tracks where the two strategies are as quick as each other and it’s whoever optimises their own choice what makes it better or between two and a three. When it's in between, that's when the racing is good. Yeah, answering the first part, I think it's been a decent season overall. I was feeling good with the car straight away from the beginning of the season. Then, going through this first phase of the year, where we were trying to understand where we were, why we were suddenly half a second off Red Bull. Why at other circuits we were nearly on pole. I think understanding what was going on and what had Red Bull done to all of us, which was to, all of a sudden, dominate the way they were doing. First part was obviously a bit under expectations, but then we put our heads down and we started working well, and we nailed the opportunity when it came in Singapore. And I think that means a lot for us this year. Where I'm at is that I'm comfortable. I'm happy in Ferrari. I trust the team. I see positive steps being taken in the right direction. I see a committed team working in the right direction. And I've always said, I'm happy here and that the winter was going to be a good time to sit down and see if we can come to an agreement for the future. Which, if they're happy with me, and I'm happy with them, shouldn't be too much of a problem. And yeah, it's hopefully going to happen this winter. And if not, it will drag for longer. But let's see. Yeah, same. I've done my simulator session already. Must have been 50 or 60 laps, which is normally what I like to do when it's a new track. And then I think the big thing there, as you said, will be the temperature and how the tyres behave in those temperatures. Also, given the track layout – very long straights – so, a tyre will cool down on those straights and then getting into a corner on a very low downforce setting, like we’re expecting in Vegas, on a cold tyre, on a new surface, I think there could be many variables for tyres and temperatures in general to be a big talking point that weekend. And graining, if it's very cold, like we've seen in winter testing… Not in Bahrain, but in other venues. So yeah, I think those are the things we will be keeping an eye on, but until we get there… You can be as prepared as you want, but until you see what happens on the car, you cannot react. No, I was joking. Honestly, when it comes to this kind of thing, for me, it's a lot easier to recover. So, how do I explain it? When you have an issue that is out of your control, I feel like the day that that happens, you struggle more. You're more frustrated, against the world, against whatever happened, because you cannot control it, you feel a bit powerless and that day, Sunday, when it happens, you really are upset. But then Monday morning, after a good night's sleep you're like ‘well, nothing could have happened, focus on the next one’. I find that relatively easy. On the other hand, when you know you've done a mistake, I find it more difficult to turn the page and I spend a few days dwelling a bit on what could I have done and how could I have avoided that mistake and what I could have done differently. Yeah, I think those are two differences. And that's why maybe Qatar heard a bit more because I couldn't even start and you go all the way, flying around the world, to not even start the race and you put in all that effort, it’s frustrating. But then, Monday, I was honestly ready. That's why I said it, it was actually a bit in a joking manner.",United States,thursday,Ferrari
Valtteri Bottas,"I could wear both. Who knows? I’ll leave your imagination to decide. Correct, yeah. It's another gravel race I did with my girlfriend Tiffany and it was good. It's always seems to be the weekend before Austin so with the time difference it makes sense to come early and enjoy the event and yeah, it went well. Much needed. It really felt refreshing for everyone in the team because once you're doing so many races and without any points for sure, it starts to eat everybody's confidence a little bit, like you start to wonder, can you do it and now again, we proved for everyone in the team, yes, we can do it. If we get everything right, we can score. So definitely, yeah, a bit better vibe overall now and I hope that can carry for a bit better end of the season. It is so hard to predict because the gaps are so small but at least now we've learned a lot more about the upgrades we introduced and we even have some new bits for this race so we'll find out very soon. I think naturally, you always want to push but on the other hand, that tyre management is another skill that you can make a difference as a driver. So again, for me same thing: a nice mixture is probably the ideal one. I think in short answer, no. I think the FIA, Formula 1 they did take things seriously after the race. It was always going to be a hot race but to be that big of a struggle for many drivers, that was a little bit unpredictable. It was just how humidity got that day, I think caught everybody out. I'm sure it's going to be a talking point in the drivers’ meeting and going forward. So I think they are taking things seriously.",United States,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Lando Norris,"Yeah, pretty proud. I don't think many people in the world get to achieve such a thing. So that and also people who do enter Formula 1, not many people get to stay for a full 100. So I do want to stay for many more and I think that's still my next target. But 100 races, a lot of ups and downs, a lot of great memories. Good success so pleasant journey so far. I don't know, I don't know what would be my best race. The obvious ones are always the podium ones. First pole position, first podium in Formula 1 are those ones you always remember. Maybe not the best. I think if I looked at results, certain other races, the one-two with Daniel in ‘21. Two races this year have been just very enjoyable, very strong. So many good ones, different places, Silverstone probably being one of the biggest highlights of it all, being my home race. So yeah, a lot of good ones. But ones I'm still trying to override by getting that first win. Not so confident. Just a lot more slow speed corners, which is not our strength. I think it's tough when you look at it. If we look at Singapore, obviously we're not bad in Singapore, clearly not as strong as Ferrari but still not a bad race. But we know on these types of circuits, Mercedes is going to be very strong, Ferrari is going to be very strong, Aston, here in the past have been very strong. It's just not a track… like we knew when we went to Qatar it was going to be a track which really suited us: a lot of medium high speed which is where we're very strong and almost on par with Red Bull. Less of that here and a lot more slow speed so I'm definitely not as confident but nevertheless, I'm not saying it's going to be a bad weekend. I think we can still fight. It's just going to be a much bigger fight, I think. Honestly, I'm not going to change that much. The margins are so small and yeah, the thing which made it all worse is I was… not easily but… I should have been on pole in both… I say both occasions, definitely for Saturday, maybe not so much for Sunday, but at worst, I should have been first and second or second and first. So when I realised what could have been, and what should have been then coming to the race, how strong our race pace was on Sunday and at parts quicker than the Red Bull, I feel like there was a lot of missed opportunities from my side but at the same time, there's been plenty of other races this weekend where I've not made mistakes and I feel like I've performed very well but obviously the ones which always picked up all the bad cases, so yeah, I made the mistakes, I was frustrated at the time. I've moved on and I guess, yeah, it happens to everyone but I'll try and make sure it doesn't happen again. I like a mixture to be honest, I like both. You normally prefer the ones which are like this. I did enjoy Qatar just with racing, with the pitstops, more to do with strategy, things like that. I enjoy that side. I also enjoy the races where you have to look after the tyres and manage things. Having both is good, I don't think you just would want one of them. I feel like that's more prescribed racing rather than just natural racing. So it depends on circuits and characteristics, tyre wear, all of those things. But I enjoyed Qatar, just the conditions were obviously very tough, that's what made it so tricky. But it was more the temperature which made it tough. Of course, three pitstops, that can happen in any race we ever do but the conditions in that just made it even tougher. No. I think they're doing a good job. I don't think anyone expected it to be as bad as what it was in Qatar. I think more can be done but I think they’re fine. Also with the porpoising, no one knew it was really going to happen necessarily, probably apart from Red Bull. But they did the necessary things to limit it. I don’t think, honestly, there's a lot more you do than normal. I've already done my simulator work for Vegas. The temperature is one to prepare for, both in terms of a driver's hands. You know, you need your hands to work well when you're driving, so being on top of all of that is something we're already looking into – just simple things sometimes, with hand warmers and gloves and whatever. Apart from that, no… Learning how to play poker, things like that! No, nothing, nothing in particular, just hard work, I guess, is probably the best answer for it. It's something that the mechanics and everyone… I guess we have a whole team for it, here and back at the factory that do a lot of work with many people involved. But there's a lot of people involved in pit stops, it's not just simply the mechanics, you know, but the reviews and the equipment and everything, and it's something we've spent a lot of time over the last few years… And I say years, it's not like just suddenly the guys focus on pit stops and you do better you know, it's complicated. It's a tricky process to improve on. But, you know, over the years, and especially this year, the guys have done an excellent job of making that next big step to challenging, I think it was Red Bull, really. If you look at the top 30 fastest pit stops, like 25 were Red Bull. But we've got better and better and especially this year we've put in some very good performances, and even last year at times. So, just hard work is the best answer. Just like a driver doing a good job on track, it's the same for the mechanics with the pit stops. They look at the data, the analysis, they look at trying to improve every area possible, being physically fit enough, you know, all those things. There's no short answer for really anything in Formula 1. Just that and hitting my marks. Doing the simple things make a big difference sometimes. But impressive, you know, in a time when the pit stop almost should be slower than ever before because of heavier tyres and the limited things you're allowed with the equipment, no trick things like some teams had in the past. There's almost no way that they should be as quick as what they were, so I think that's another hats off to all the crew.",United States,thursday,McLaren
Daniel Ricciardo,"I’m well. I'm very happy to be back. Thanks for asking. The hand is good. And yeah, I just want to get back to it now. It's nice. People ask me about it. It's nice. But I've also answered a lot of questions about it. So it's good. Well, I would say, tougher than I thought. But I'm probably a bit of a wuss as well. So maybe not tougher than I thought! But yeah, I think it was really just when the accident happened, and we were aware of what bone broke, they seemed fairly OK with that bone, in terms of ‘oh yeah, it's a relatively easy one’, to let's say, fix. But then, yeah, when we got the surgery done in Spain, we got further checks done and it was just the break was a lot worse than it first seemed. So I think that's what took a lot longer for the recovery, and probably made it a little more painful for myself. So, I went out to Singapore where they had some pretty big updates. And that was actually a pretty positive weekend for the team. So that looked good. And the drivers were saying that they could feel some good differences. So yeah, I'm expecting a car that is a little stronger than where I left it. But I mean, it's going to be the third race I've done this year, so I'm still very green for this season. But in saying that, I’m not using that as an excuse, but yeah, everything kind of still feels new to me. Yes. One does. He did a very good job. I don't think much more to say. That’s the first I'd heard. I think it's the first we all heard. So. Yep. Not sure. Scary! I believe so. Definitely. You know, I also welcome Miami and Vegas and anything else that comes up in the future, for sure – but this was… yeah, it feels like it has built up that identity of the American Grand Prix. It certainly feels very America out here. And yeah, I think it’s something that we’ve all enjoyed and got behind. And I saw previously I think, Valtteri wearing the cowboy hat in the press conference and Zhou was, I think, looking pretty cowboy coming into the circuit this morning and all that. So, yeah, we all do love it, we get behind it. I think also the facility, the circuit, everything, the whole event is huge. I think last year was 400,000 over the course of the weekend, or something like that. So not only us drivers but everyone loves it. I think they extended it a couple years ago, was it? I think they named like a contract extension, which made me very happy. And yeah, it's a special thing. Even just having a circuit that's close to a city, you know? All us being able to stay downtown and experiencing a little bit of the culture of the city, as opposed to some circuits we stay in motor homes in a paddock and don't really see anything. I think that's also a really nice thing with this race. I would say, in short, no, I think, look, we've all certainly… all of our profiles have grown, in the last few years, in particular, since Drive to Survive. So we've all kind of felt a bit of that. I think just me with my personality, and also just having some fun with the sport. Yeah, that probably got a little bigger as well, because of that. It draws a few LOLs every now and then but I think generally, first and foremost, I certainly see myself as a race car driver, not an entertainer or anything like that. It is funny sometimes, people come up to me like: ‘you were great in that season’ and I’m: ‘racing season – or Drive to Survive season?’ So yeah, for sure, to some, we’re maybe not all viewed as race car drivers. But yeah, it's just it's part of it. But I think we're all also, as I said, building profiles and a bit of a brand, but it's not anything that's taken away from the racing side of it. And that's first and foremost. And I think that's, for sure, through all of this, it can maybe get away from you a little bit of time so me coming back into it this year and having a little bit of that time off, it certainly made me kind of just figure out what I'm about, I guess, moving forward and how I want to go racing. Probably just removing a few things and kind of going back to a little bit of the basics. And yeah, just making sure that I am seen as a as a race car driver who's still hungry and determined and not someone who's just here for a good time. I don’t know why you’re not in Texas with that beard! It’s kind of disappointing mate – you’d fit in well. So, Liam did a great job for sure. I think in terms of him, let’s say, currently now having a seat next year, it’s one of those ones where he’s young, it’s not like he’s at the end of his career, he’s very much in the early part of his career, so keep assisting, keep your head down. I think he did very well to create an opportunity for himself, so I think if he keeps on that course, his time will come. That's really it. We always feel, as drivers, we all obviously believe in ourselves so much that you always feel like you're ready. And why isn't it happening yet? Your career can be very long, I guess. It’s not over. I mean, he's young. He's 21 or something. I'm sure he'll find a way on the grid if he keeps up what he's been doing.",United States,thursday,RB
Lewis Hamilton,"Move forwards. Yeah, just excited to get… You know, the great thing about our sport is that there's always another day to get back on the horse and just been pushing, moving forwards and nothing I can do about the past. There's definitely things we can learn from, I can learn from, which I have, and just now focused on getting back in and excited for these next races that come, especially the back-to-backs. Well, I mean, they have spoken to me and their actual point is, and I think it's important, it was just really, when I sat in the meeting, or in the stewards’ office, obviously I put my hands up. In the heat of the moment, it was the wrong decision. And what's important is to send the right message, particularly for the younger drivers, throughout the ages, that that's not the thing to do. And I apologised at the time. And I think they're just looking at how to make sure that doesn't happen moving forwards. Well, it's been a huge amount of work back at the factory. This is our last big update, or the biggest of the large updates through the season, and I’m really excited to see how it feels. All the amazing people back at the factory have worked incredibly hard during the whole season and hopefully this really kind of tips the needle a little bit and helps us in the right direction of where we want to pursue next year. But yeah, I don't know exactly all the different parts of the circuit that I’ll feel it. But hopefully it's a global improvement and hopefully puts us a little bit closer to the guys ahead. No, I don't think I was singled out. I think, ultimately, it was just poor communication. I don't think what they had said is exactly what they meant. I think what they mean is that they're just going to look into how they can tackle those sorts of things moving forwards to make sure that it doesn't happen. And I mean, if you look at it, I think there was a karting incident recently where a kid was hit. So we really need to make sure that we're continuously focusing on safety. And I think that's really at the core, at the root of it, but I just think they probably need to speak to their PR agent to do a better job. Similar to the guys. It’s the first time I’ve heard of it. So I’m not really sure what it’s referring to exactly. I think we need to… when it comes to things like this I really do think we need to be thinking about the message that this sends out to those that are watching. If they are going to fining people a million, let’s make sure one hundred per cent of that goes to a cause. There’s a lot of money in this whole industry and a lot more that we need to do in terms of creating better accessibility, better diversity, more opportunities for people who wouldn’t normally have the opportunity to get into a sport like this. So many causes around the world. That’s the only way they’ll get that million from me. Well, thank you for the question. I mean, it's a very good question. I would probably be running the sport if I knew all the answers to that – but I think it's continuing to engage with the outside world and, and as I was mentioned before, really creating more accessibility. I think before, when I used to come out to the States, like 2007, the first time out here, and for many, many years, every time we stepped for that one race, that sometimes did and sometimes didn't happen in the years, you always find yourself just repeating yourself, educating. I couldn’t fully understand when I went to NFL games, NBA games, seeing how passionate the Americans are about sport, how they hadn't yet caught the bug that many of us grew up catching when we were younger. And so it's been really, really amazing to see that so many, the whole country, really, a large portion of the country is now speaking about it. People own simulators, everyone wants to be a driver! So, it's been great to see. And I think we have to continue to look at what is next. I think having the three races out here in such a huge nation, I think is massively helpful. This is one of my favourite tracks, actually. Often when they build new circuits, they're not really like the classics. But this is a classic from the get-go. And it's one that enables us to have great races. And, you know, when you got up to up to Turn 1, you see that huge crowd, it's really quite amazing. So, it'll be interesting to see… I think, within our sport, we have to continue to work on making sure we’re having close racing, because I think you've seen the social engagement drop a huge amount this year being that… so, it's obviously heavily impacted on competition. People want to see that. So, we have to make sure that we're making the right decisions, or the governing body is making the right decisions, to keep us close and great racing right to the end. We need to more grandstands. I don't know whether we need to lower the cost but maybe, I don't know. And then just looking in these different places, making sure that when we go into these different countries, we're working also on the impact, not just a circus that arrives and leaves a mess behind. But looking at how we can really leave a legacy behind in each of these places that we go to. Actually, I should have actually mentioned that before. The movie is a huge step in that direction of broadening the horizon. I think that's really part of the new leadership, with Liberty, with the great work that Stefano and Greg are doing in being open to trying new things. And the fact that we're allowed to do this movie, and have the concessions in terms of allowing an extra team being on track and filming with these film stars is… it's never been done before. And it's great that we are embarking on things that we've never done before. And I think honestly, I really think they're doing an amazing job. Vegas is… there’s going to be a huge spotlight on Vegas. And that will play an important part of our movie also, which we’re really just working as hard as we can to make sure that it's a true reflection of this legendary sport. Both the old and the new. And also Miami, we've got these great cities here, with amazing fan bases in each of them, all providing a different atmosphere. I always felt that we needed more than one race here because the complaint was always people having to get up at 4 or 5AM or something, in the middle of the night to watch a Grand Prix. So, it's really difficult to get into it. And then also, it's only coming to the country once a year. So, I think this is really enabling it to be something with a buzz that's continuing. But we do have to continue to grow. And I think the movie particularly is going to help do that. It is the only truly international or global sport. And so we need to educate more and more people in it. There’s still many people out there we’ve got to get to catch the bug. And there's plenty of growing to do.",United States,thursday,Mercedes
Kevin Magnussen,"Yeah, it's good. It's nice to see the upgrade on the car, finally. We haven't had many upgrades to the car this year. It's been a tough year in terms of just finding performance. The guys have been really struggling this year to make gains on the car we've had. And, you know, I think this upgrade is an exciting one, because it's very different. On paper, it's not actually meant to be more downforce as such, but it's a new concept. And it's hopefully the concept that we'll be using for next year's car. And, you know, if it’s not a big gain in performance, then at least It's some good learning and research into next year, I think a big problem with our car this year has been that it doesn't treat the tyres very well in the race. So, we'll just struggle with tyre life in the races. The pace that other people are able to maintain, we seem to fall off much more and that problem might be – although you're not putting extra downforce, like, peak downforce – if you can better the characteristics of the car, the through-corner balance and, you know, hopefully, the structure and the strength of the flow on the car, that could solve that issue or help that issue. So that's, of course, what we're hoping for. Yeah, nonetheless, it's exciting. Yeah, I don’t know what offence it is to be a million but that sounds ridiculous. I mean, Charles can give his watch – but I would disappear, never to be found again. Yeah, it has. I mean, it's a good sponsorship. It’s money – and we all know what that means in Formula 1. I think the situation we have right now, where we have five races left of the season, and we're bringing a fairly substantial upgrade, that is something that wouldn't have happened in in the past. We haven't brought many upgrades this year, but that's because the team hasn't found the improvements that justified producing a big upgrade and spending that money for not a big gain. So, you know, they've changed concept and they're now finding much more in the wind tunnel and it looks much more promising in the future development. So, bringing this upgrade with a few races to go is a very positive thing. You know, as I said, of course we hopefully it will improve our pace on track right now but even if it isn't, then it's still very good learning and very good research for next year's development. Yeah, I don't know what Liam's deal is but you know, certainly, he did a good job in those races that he did. So, I think all to play for him, I guess.",United States,thursday,Haas
Charles Leclerc,"Well, I hope so. I think on paper, Qatar was probably one of the worst tracks for us, for the conditions, but also for the track characteristics in itself. Having said that, I think on Sprint weekends, the thing that has the most influence is how your FP1 goes, because then from FP1 you cannot change the car anymore. So the priority is to start FP1 strongly, and then to take the right decision with the set-up. And we know that this is crucial for the rest of the weekend. Much more than our car characteristic fitting the track. Well, the high-speed is where you need confidence, that's clear. But where we've been lacking a bit more in the last few races was the medium, slow-speed corners. So this is where we'll be focusing more. It is a huge amount of money, so again, I have no idea about what deserves a $1 million penalty – but it’s more than… I mean, some drivers are making less than that, so it’s a lot of money and… yeah… I don’t know. Very similar thinking. I think there are some tracks that are much more difficult to manage than others. I think Qatar was one of those. I think here will be one of those too. I've always preferred, in the past, to use the red and white kerb because this is a reference that we can actually feel inside the car, whereas the white line… we are so low in the car that it's very difficult to see exactly where we are. If we are two centimetres out or exactly on the line is very difficult, whereas with the kerb, you can feel it much more what's going on and it's a better reference. But yeah, now it's been quite a long time that we are staying on the white line and is the way it is at the moment. We just need to try and find a way, especially with the way the kerbs are done and the tracks are made, in order to help each other, for it to become less of an issue in the future.",United States,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"I mean, nothing major, just a little bit with friends. And I mean, it was also just nice to be home a little bit before you know heading into this triple-header. So yeah, nothing too crazy. Well, I mean, looking at the season, yes, but it's a Sprint weekend. We have to nail FP1 to make sure that the car is working well for qualifying. So yeah, a bit early to say anything at the moment. Yeah, it's a nice number that I never thought I would hit. But now that we are getting close to it, I mean, we want to, of course, try and expand a little bit more. But yeah, we’ll see. I mean, it's more important that we just focus on the weekend, not on the number. I would like to know what that offence can be! One mil! If touching a rear wing is €50k, then I would like to know what one mill is. Then maybe we can also sponsor the bottles of wine. I’ll get ready. Yeah, I saw that from the outside people were trying to basically talk some BS, because I think the mood in the team is very good. Everyone knows exactly what their role is. And of course, you know, sad times last year when Dietrich passed away, but you know, we tried to keep that legacy, keep moving it forward. And everyone that we have right now in the team is very important to that success that we're having. So that's why there are also no changes for the future. So, I think that basically explains it. I don't know. I think they're all just beautiful in a different way. But I think the very first one probably was the most emotional one – because that's what you always tried to achieve. And I think that was definitely a very special day for me and my family at the time. But to pick another one, it’s tough. It’s just about also enjoying the moment. I mean, maybe you think about it a bit more later on in your career, but not now. I will happily let anyone else drive my car, see if they can do better with track limits! Some tracks, yeah, just a lot of runoff, so naturally you are a bit… you find probably the limits a bit easier because we never really talk about track limits, for example, in Suzuka and that's probably a bit more of an old school track. So, for sure, yeah, the latest kind of track standards, they have a thing to do with it and it's a bit of a shame – because I feel like with some of these new tracks that you're more focused on a Quali lap to not go over a white line than actually finding the limit or just the pure enjoyment of pushing. It’s more like you’re looking at: ‘did I make it or not?’ Oh, yeah, I made it. It’s a bit odd. We need to do a better job because I think this weekend will be the same story.",United States,thursday,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah. Just a mega race from start to finish. A good opening lap, I learned from my mistake yesterday of going wide. I told you I’d go tight, and I did and it worked out. So, good start, good pace throughout the whole thing. Probably the best pace out there today, so I’m happy. Stressful, hot sweaty, little bit tired but a great job for the team. Three in a row now. 1.8s pit-stop as well by the boys. yeah, I think the three-stop made it a lot harder, just physically. You could push a lot more. Even the last stint, you could pretty much push flat-out. One of the hardest races I’ve done, in a way, but it’s a nice challenge and congrats to Oscar. No mistakes. And, of course, Max once again. They need it, I guess. I think we knew we had great pace. So it was a bit tough to know – just what you had to do with the pit stops and things. I think it was really hard for anyone to really know how it was all going to play out. But we knew we had great pace, maybe not initially to fight for a win, but to get up to the front at least. And initially, I would say, to fight the Mercedes, but they did a lovely job of making our life a lot easier. So I didn't really need to think of that and could just focus on catching the guys that we were definitely quicker than, which was the Ferrari and the Astons. And yeah, by the time we came through Turn 1, I felt like we could at least fight for the podium straightaway. So from lap one a podium was on the cards and that was my target. But the pace turned out to be probably better than I was expecting, you know, for us to be, at points in the race, probably a bit quicker than Max. Maybe at some points a bit slower. But I think on the whole first to finish P3 was as good as it could have been today. So I'm happy for the whole team, for Oscar, for everyone at McLaren, for us to have two cars on the podium again, for a third time, is fantastic. Yes. Yeah, probably. I don't know how much quicker Max could have gone in qualifying. But I guess if I want to be honest with myself, I should have fought for two pole positions this weekend. And potentially two victories. I know it's a big thing to say, but I think if things went well, if I just did a better job and didn't make the mistakes I did over the last two days, which is why I've been so frustrated, because I knew what was on the cards, what we were able to potentially achieve. And that was victories, both yesterday and today. So I feel like it was a weekend of missed opportunities for myself to take the fight to Max and at least give ourselves that opportunity. Yeah, so I don't know. There’s good things and bad things. I feel like I've missed out and didn't do what I should have done and achieve what I should have achieved but I'm definitely still happy with a P3. I can't take anything away from that. But in the back of my head, I know I should have done more this weekend. I'm not sure. Whenever I got a bit closer towards Oscar, the dirty air was quite a big struggle. Like, even with the backmarkers, as soon as you got within three seconds or something, you immediately lost time. Around a circuit where it's so much about load and these long corners, as soon as you have a bit of dirty air, it's a big struggle. So I think my pace was definitely a bit better. But it's hard to know. And I mean, Oscar has done a very good job this weekend. He's beaten me. He's been extremely quick and he’s made less mistakes, and he's come out on top. So hats off to him too. Hmm, you should ask Max! Tough to say. I think the Red Bull is normally that step better in the race with degradation. I don't even feel like our degradation was bad today. I feel like we could push, even towards the end of stints I didn’t feel like we were suddenly struggling a lot. Maybe if it was a two-stopper and we had to eke out the tyres that bit more, that's where we would have seen the Red Bull just be more consistent. And like in Japan, that's where he was always a bit better was just that second part of the stint, just keeping the consistency and we would drop off a bit. So maybe we didn't see that today. Nevertheless, for the race today, it was very good. So, it shows that when we can keep the tyres in a good condition we’re closer and we're getting closer to what we need. But we still know at certain tracks… Like, the last few weekends, we’ve not changed anything on the car. This weekend's been a lot better, but it's the same car as the last few weeks. So we still know we have a lot to do in the background. I think today we probably found the limit. I think it's sad we had to find it this way. It's never a nice situation to be in, you know, some people ending up in the medical centre or passing out, things like that. So, pretty dangerous thing to have going on. But it's not a point where you can just go, the drivers need to train more or do any of that, you know. We're in a closed car that gets extremely hot in a very physical race. And it's frustrating. I guess on TV, it probably doesn't look very physical at all, but clearly, when you have people who end up retiring or in such a bad state, it's too much, you know, for the speeds we're doing. It is too dangerous. I know that this race next year is later on in the season, and it will be a lot cooler a few months later, but it's something that needs to be thought of and I'm sure we'll speak about it because it shouldn't have happened in the first place. I crashed out of Miami so I can't use that one. I would say it's probably been the worst one. Maybe it's there and Singapore, definitely just the two worst ones. Singapore is a bit different, just because you need like more concentration and the race last year when it was wet, drying out like the humidity was insane. You needed even more concentration, this is just a different task because you have a lot more high speed corners. Physically, your body's probably taking a bigger hit but you don't have the walls and things like that. So it's a bit of a different challenge. Probably for the first time ever, I've drunk from my bottle during the race. I actually wanted my engineer to remind me to drink; normally I never even use the drinks bottle. Today was probably the first time I actually wanted it and I had it. I don't know how far we are by behind P3? It’s doable. I think so. A couple of races ago it was, 70-something to Aston. I don't know what it is now? Seventeen? I mean, Fernando said we were overconfident as well! I think we're just doing a good job, not just in terms of pace but today we had a 1.8 second pit stop which is pretty impressive from the guys. They've been working extremely hard so to reward the whole team consistently is only more motivating and a bigger boost every weekend. They like the taste of success. It's the first time they're getting it consistently and I think that only makes them want it more and more and more every weekend that we're doing so the guys are doing a great job. I think we’re both doing a decent job too, so we'll keep it up. We know that Mercedes are very quick, probably as almost as quick as us today, just they keep making mistakes. So I'm sure if they have a clean weekend they will maybe make our life a bit more tricky and therefore I'm not as confident in saying it. But like I was comparing to Ferrari, it was only three weekends ago that Ferrari were close to… were on pole and almost winning races and nothing has really changed, it's just a different track. We're looking better, they’re looking a bit worse. I think we're definitely not overconfident. We're confident, I think we need to be, but we know there's still going to be some races where we're not going to be quite as strong.",Qatar,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"I thought you were going to say I got given a five-second penalty again for track limits! Scared the crap out of me! No, very, very happy obviously. Turn one was nice. That was definitely in the game-plan before the race. But yeah, really impressive pace, definitely the hardest race I’ve had in my life. I would say that Lando was just standing because it’s compulsory – but he’s still going. Yeah. It was hot. I think also, like Lando said, with the three stops, it was basically flat-out. It was 57 qualifying laps which I definitely feel I have done. Really good race, happy that all the tyres stayed together. It was good, obviously. Yeah, it's been pretty exceptional, to be honest. I think Friday was difficult. You know, obviously a bit disappointed after Qualifying on Friday, but yesterday went as close to perfect as it could have. And today, I think second was probably the most we could have done. So, yeah, very, very happy. Exciting weekend, a lot of progress made. And yeah, I think you know, just very proud of that. As a team and also for myself personally, that we've managed to get the most out of what our car's been capable of. Hit the brakes at the right time, and watch everyone else go off! Yeah, honestly, it was as simple as that. I don't really know what happened. Obviously, saw some cars spinning and whatever else but, yeah, the heavens kind of just parted way for me and through to second I went. A little bit. I think still some improvements to make. I think this race was very different to Japan, obviously with three stops, I think we were basically pushing flat out for the whole race. So, it's a very different kind of race. But, I think, still some work to go. I mean, it was just a different kind of tyre deg. I think it was much more front limited this weekend. I think the front left and trying to protect that was by far the biggest thing. So yeah, just a different learning experience, I guess. But still good to have it in the bank. I was a little bit surprised to be honest. I would have accepted it either way. But obviously there was a lot of concerns about tires and track limits and stuff. So yeah, I think getting second and third for the team was the most important thing. Just extremely hot. You know, even from the beginning, even before I put my helmet on, before the start of the race, I was sweating. And it definitely didn't get any better once I was driving. So yeah, just very hot. And I think it was a combination of a lot of things, the humidity as well, having three stops meant we're pushing flat out. And just the nature of the track, you know, there are a lot of high speed corners, that just sort of naturally take their toll. Yeah, definitely the hardest race I've done. Yeah, I think it probably helped us rather than hindered. I think it ended up in a race where we could push flat out the whole time or very close to, which I don't think I've been able to say in an F1 race before. So, I think it probably helped us a bit. Like Lando said, I think the Red Bull normally is a step ahead in terms of tyre degradation maybe we didn't see that as much today with the rules. But I think also our car pace this weekend has been very strong. So I think that's also been another factor. Yeah, I'm very glad that we're coming back later next year. I think today is also probably been hotter and more humid than the last couple of days. So that's not helped things. I think Thursday was like four or five degrees hotter than it was today. So in that sense, we're almost a little bit lucky, it wasn't worse. But yeah, definitely the toughest race I've done. And yeah, obviously we need some discussions, I think about a lot of things from this weekend. But, yeah, obviously, it's not a good situation to be in. That’s a lot. Yeah, I think Suzuka and here have probably been tracks we've been looking at for quite a while in terms of what's going to favour us. I think there's going to be some races that are going to be more difficult than here and probably will suit other teams a bit better. I think 79 points in what, five races and a couple of Sprints? It's a big challenge but yeah, we'll give it a go. I think obviously the gap to Aston now is very achievable. But yeah, hopefully we can do it.",Qatar,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think what made the race was my first stint. After that I could just manage my pace, making sure that the tyres were always in a good window – but the McLarens were quick again today. I had to push for it. It was definitely a tough race out there. One of. Yeah. Top five probably. Yeah, I’m already sweating quite a bit, so I wonder what happened last night – but we’ll enjoy a little bit but y’know there’s still quite a few races out there that we want to win. I prefer weekends where we push just as long as we can on a tyre and not force pit-stops. We design cars to be good on tyres. Today, we couldn’t optimise that fully, because that’s normally our strong point – but we’ll see what we can improve in the future. Yeah, I think it was, overall a good race. I think what really made my race was that first stint, where I think we were quite strong and good on the tyres. After that, because we had a bit of a tyre offset, compared to the McLaren, I could drive a bit longer on most of the sets, which maybe in some places, then cost me a bit on the out-lap and stuff. So then sometimes the gap looked a bit closer than it should have been. Then on the Hard tyre, I lost quite a bit of time, I think, in the last two, three laps, because I had to get through some traffic. And then I had to slow stop as well to the end. So, then they were very close behind me. But yeah, overall, of course, they have been really quick all weekend. So, I think especially with the fuel coming out, it looked like they were again picking up more and more pace, compared to me. Plus, of course, that three stop that was mandatory, I think was not ideal for us, personally. Because our car is good on tyres. So, when you need to do longer stints because that's the fastest way around here, it would have probably been a bit better. But yeah, it was same for everyone at the end that we had to do those stops. We had to deal with that. And yeah, made it also probably bit harder to drive. We had to push quite hard out there. And yeah, as you could see, after the race, a lot of people are quite tired, I think. Yeah. So, pushing-wise for sure you could push a little bit more on the tyres, because you were just limited to those laps. And yeah, besides that, it’s of course, a bit of a shame that we had to do that. But yeah, luckily, I think nothing really happened. And I think that was, of course, the most important. I think it did grip up a little bit. Probably if we come back next year it will be again a bit better but it depends on how much it will be driven. I think it's important that other kinds of categories come back, or come here and race a little bit more, because you have to take, a bit, that oil out of the tarmac when it's new, and also a bit more like a wider grip line. At the moment, I think it's still too much like one line. But it seemed to really ramp up. I think next time that we get into a situation like this, I don't think F1 should be, like, the first one to drive because it looks a bit silly. And, like, FP1 with cars, you know, sliding around having no grip, I think is important when we go to a track where they’ve put new tarmac, that at least it’s run in a little, y’know? That will then help a lot. Also, for understanding the tyres, for example, what we had now. That's why we had these forced, of course, limited laps. So yeah, a few things I think to learn out of this this weekend as a whole. Yeah, I do think so. I mean, I mentioned before why I think it was that close. But for sure, yeah, I mean, McLaren is making great steps forward, throughout the whole year. And from our side, yeah, for sure, we’ll try to improve maybe a little bit this year, but of course mainly for next year. Yeah, when I saw the weather before coming here, I was not looking forward to it. It's just too warm, and like Lando said it has nothing to do with more training or whatever. I think some of the guys who were struggling today are extremely fit, probably even fitter than me, but just the whole day it's like you’re walking around in a sauna and, yeah, also then in the night the humidity goes up. The races are quite long. But it's not the only place. There are a few places like that. I think Singapore is almost like a two-hour race. And it's very, very warm. I think it's also quite on the limit of what is what should be allowed. So there are a few things to look at. But this was definitely way too hot. To drive? Yeah, the feeling in the car was definitely very, very warm. So yeah, I don't think that was good. I think where I felt quite bad was last year in Miami. Yeah, I was completely… Yeah, I don't know why that was… I just felt extremely destroyed. But yeah, today was tough for sure. It also depends a bit where you are on track, how much you have to push to the end of the race, a lot of circumstances. But like I said before, these kind of temperatures are just too extreme, I think. I do think that as a team they are probably the most consistent, compared to the others behind us. And I do think they have the best driver line-up out of all of them. So yeah, they are operating really well. And, yeah, it's going to be interesting to the end of the year, but also I think the start of next year to see where everyone is at. Yeah, I think that was on the first stint when most of the drivers boxed, my front left still looked quite good. Yeah, I do think that today didn't help us in terms of like… our trend is normally long stints and looking after our tyres. This didn't work for us today, of course, they were too limited, the stints, but I do think at one point, my engineer told me to speed up a bit and we always had the pace to speed up. I just have to re-watch the race a little bit to understand a bit more what was going on behind me. I do think we had a bit more pace in hand if we really needed it but nevertheless, I don't want to take anything away from McLaren. They've been doing a great job and from us, we see that they are getting closer and closer. So we have to try and of course maintain a bit of a gap. I have a lot of plans racing-related and trying to help young talent. So far, all of us or probably most of us have come through the karting ranks but that's also very, very expensive nowadays. So as I have my own Sim team, I do believe that there is a possibility to get back to Sim racing and I do see a lot of potential in some of these guys, that they can make it in the real world as well. So hopefully in a few years’ time, I can have a way of sim racers making it into a real car. This doesn't mean progressing all the way to F1 but it can be to an endurance seat or whatever. That's something that I'm very passionate about and hopefully I can make it happen very soon.",Qatar,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean a great start to the weekend. It's quite tricky out there, you know, with the new tarmac, it still needs to rubber in. Very peaky grip. So as soon as you over-push it a little bit, the rear wants to step out and stuff, but of course very happy to be on pole. It's been a good day for us Well, I want to win it, of course. I mean, we put it on pole, so naturally you want to, of course, win the race. But first of all let's make sure that tomorrow we have a good day as well. I think the car is quick. Of course tomorrow, let's say, well, morning, afternoon, however you like it, I think it's going to be, again, a bit more difficult for to get the tyres ready to work well, with the sand coming onto the track as well. But yeah, it's a great start to the weekend. The car is working well. That's all I could hope for really. Yeah, I mean, I think it was difficult for everyone out there, you know, with the new tarmac, there was not a lot of grip. And as soon as you, I wouldn't even say overstep it, but you tried to just carry a little bit more speed into the corner, the rear really wants to step out and that made it very tricky to find the limit in qualifying run after run, to see how much the track was improving, but then not overdo it. We tried to just follow the track as best as we could. And yeah, my first run in Q3 was good. I was happy with the balance of the car, considering the track conditions. Overall, a good day and more than I could have hoped for really, because it's always a bit hectic, you know, the Sprint format, to after one session optimise the car. And then especially with this new tarmac as well, it's probably even more difficult, but it was good. I felt good. Well, FP1 was OK. But it was all about just fine-tuning a few things and just seeing what the track was going to do, because I had no clue how much it was going to improve. Also. I mean, some places, of course, you had a headwind and then a tailwind, and the car was a bit all over the place because of it. But you have to try and drive around it. I have no idea, because I only got to Turn 4. But the lap before was alright. But for sure, there's always a little bit more to it, because the track I think was improving every time. But it was OK. Same as always. I mean, it doesn't really change anything. I just want to have a good weekend. And of course, I know in the back of my mind that's happening, but it doesn't add any extra pressure or whatever. I just want to enjoy the weekend and try to do the best I can. I tried to carry a little bit more speed into the corner and it just gave up on me. I knew, of course, I had that lap already. So I was like, I’ll just try to push a little bit more and really, you know, try to give it everything I have. But it's the track surface. At the moment it doesn't let you push a tiny bit more. As soon as you stress a little bit too much it really snaps at you and you can't correct it. So that's a bit of a bit of a shame. But yeah, it was nothing major. Maybe. We'll find out next year. There's no point to talk about it now. I'm just enjoying the moment and we keep pushing. We keep working hard. It’s always difficult to say, you know, where we would have ended up if we would have had a normal weekend, but with the track conditions, for sure it's a little bit more difficult to anticipate stuff, but I think we did the best we could really. I think it's never going to be perfect. But clearly it was good enough and I was quite happy with the car in qualifying. But, you know, it can also be that you try sometimes – and we've had it in the past – that you know you make a few decisions where you think it's going to be okay and then it doesn't work out and then your whole weekend is ruined because you can't touch the car and I think that is a bit of a shame. And that's maybe something we have to look into for the future if we want to continue doing these kinds of events, because it sometimes… I mean, I understand, of course, for the show it's good to mix it up a bit, but at least you should be able to correct your mistake or potential mistake. Yeah, it's tough. It's always tough, honestly. I mean, it's easy to go just over it. I do think these kerbs are a little bit better. I don't think people who actually went wide, actually gained time? It's just a bit annoying, because if you go a little bit wider, like you bottom out and you damage your floor, potentially and you definitely lose time. So I think that has been already a big positive compared to last time that we were here. I think why don't we really see track limits in, for example, Suzuka, is because it's old school. If you go off, there's immediate gravel. Of course, already in some places, Suzuka, you have these like double kerbs. And there might be track limits. But in the older places, which they haven't touched, you never talk about track limits. So yeah, I would always prefer to see that style of racing. But of course, some places we share with bikes and they like a bit more run-off. And we always have to try and find a compromise. But sometimes it hurts them. Sometimes it hurts us a little bit more, in terms of these kinds of things.",Qatar,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, it was a really tricky day for everybody. It was new tarmac, it was really slippery, super windy here, so all the sand is blowing onto the track. And we went out in qualifying and the lap times were just immense compared to what we were doing this morning. So that was good, fun, really happy to be P3 (sic). This is a bit better than we expected. Yeah, I mean, Lando and the McLarens are really quick at the moment. We obviously know Red Bull and Max are in a league of their own. But our fight at the moment is with Ferrari to secure P2 in the Constructors’ Championship, we need to be consistent and go from there. Yeah, I think it's been interesting, the second half of the season. The quali pace has been really quite exceptional compared to the start of this year. And I'm feeling really confident in the car. But this weekend, we definitely weren't expecting to be lining up P2 and P3 on the grid for Sunday. So that is a real pleasant surprise. Of course, Lando was ahead of us and his marginal off wasn't the different for his pace advantage. So, we know that we're half a step behind McLaren. But equally, our fight is with Ferrari at the moment. That's our aim for the remainder of the season. And we just need to secure as many points as possible to seal that off. Yeah, definitely. I think we see that the pace converges a little bit come Sunday. Lando was exceptionally fast in Suzuka, so he's really going to be the biggest threat. But there's no reason why we can't both fight for a podium. But there's a lot of unknowns. We don't know how the tyre degradation is going to be, the tyre wear, if it's a one-stop or two-stop. And the track is just constantly changing. And you know, the very first lap in qualifying was, I think, two seconds quicker than the quickest lap in FP1, which was probably the biggest jump I think I've ever experienced in Formula 1, so we don't know what tomorrow and Sunday are going to bring. I think in Q1 I actually made a mistake on my lap. I lost three tenths, so I think I could have been right up there in the top three. Q2 I ran the used tyre. [Coughs] God, I don't know what's going on at the moment . [Coughs] Yeah, stay hydrated! And yeah, in Q2 it was the used tyres, so I think P5 was a strong result. So, it was no big surprise to be sort of fighting for the top three in Q3. Probably waving him goodbye, I think, after Turn 1. Max has done an exceptional job. He deserves to be champion this year. Of course, you know, Formula 1, we love the competition, but we can't take anything away from what he and Red Bull have done. And we need to look at ourselves in the mirror and raise our game into next year and give them a challenge. Yeah, I believe so. I think when we look at our car we see a number of flaws in it. It's not like we're looking at it scratching our head thinking where can we improve it? We think there's loads of places that we can improve it. We've made some really good findings recently with regards to the aero of the car and some of the bits and pieces on the car, which is looking very promising. But we can never promise what we're going to deliver over the winter in terms of a result, because it's a relative game. We can only focus on ourselves. But I'm extremely confident in my team. Very confident in the decision-makers and the direction we're heading, that we've made some really great learnings. And we won't trip up and make a mistake as we have done these past few seasons. I think it's just learning and experience. I think we found ourselves off the pace at the start of this year, a long way behind where we wanted to be. We were trying many different things with the car. And I think now, probably these last five races, the set-up of the car has been relatively, much the same set-up every race we go to. So, we know what the car needs to maximise its performance. And I think that helps the consistency we build upon it. And that's also given us good direction into next year. So I think that's a big factor of it.
LH: Nothing more to add to that to be honest. Yeah, not too sure. I can't really speak for the others, just it's very challenging out there. You’ve got to be very, very precise. We're talking sort of millimetres sometimes. I've had no track limits but two races ago I crashed into the wall and lost a podium, so you know. Yeah, exactly. That was a small track limits there. So yeah, I'm not too sure, maybe. I don't know. I don't know but definitely it's a bit frustrating when we go to great circuits like this, this is a really great circuit, but then it's so difficult to know where that limit is, where the edge is, and we need to find a better solution for the future. Yeah, I think when you're in the pit lane, and you're lined up behind all of these cars, you can’t actually see how many cars there are in front of you. And we're all looking for a five to seven-second gap. And if you're lined up behind, obviously 10 cars, that’s 50 seconds at least that you have to wait. And you know, some circuits, you want to get those tyres in the right window and it adds inconsistency. So, I don't really know what the future holds. Obviously, everybody wants to get out on track and get their lap in. But equally you need to get that gap. I think what the FIA have done recently with the set time limit between the safety guidelines is definitely positive, while allowing us to take that gap in the pit lane. But it is sometimes a bit of a stressful moment. When you are sat there for literally a minute. You don't know if you can make the flag, what's going to happen, what's happening to the tyres. So that's just the challenge.",Qatar,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"No more difficult than any other qualifying session. They're always difficult. Yeah, it was obviously a bit windy today. But otherwise, pretty straightforward. Absolutely. I mean, it's always confusing, because obviously in P1 [sic], you now I was nearly out of Q1, sorry. Which is incredibly frustrating in that moment. But then we get into Q2 and all of a sudden, we're right up there. So it's very, very strange. But it's great for all the team for us to be up there. And George did a great job today. So for us to be so close, it's pretty awesome. I mean, for me, it was a relatively average qualifying session, Q1 and Q3 particularly. Yeah, if I was able to find that, put together the lap that I did in… That came too early, in Q2. I wish I had that for Q3. Yeah, just timing. We left the garage a little bit too late. We didn't get to finish our lap on the medium. And we came in and I think just a bit out of sync, and then just couldn't put it put it back together. It was quite tricky out there. And there's a lot of traffic. So when you come to the end of the lap, you had to back up a lot. But generally, I was really grateful to get through. With everyone around me. No, I'm battling the guy to the right of me for sure. I think, yeah, I’ll give it everything to try and fight him. Maybe like George said, maybe he will just disappear like he does in most of the other races, but maybe we'll be able to fight. No, I'm trying to win the race. It  doesn't matter who I'm fighting against. I have 100% faith in the guys, the team back in the factory working away on it. And who knows? I mean, we don't know where they are or where they're progressing to. I think we just have to focus on our job and not necessarily so focused on necessarily closing that gap. It’s going to be what it is. By the time we get to the first race, hopefully it is closed. Yeah, I think the new kerbs are great. When I went around the track yesterday on the scooter, I thought the kerbs looked quite big. But I think they're actually really good. And as Max said, I think when you go beyond the highest point of the kerb, you lose time. I don't feel like at this track we need to have track limits. It's something that was brought in… The new stewards brought in a couple of years ago. Lando should be up here. I think we need to maybe take these kerbs as a good learning, we can take these kerbs to a bunch of other tracks because obviously MotoGP are fine with these kerbs and we can have these in, like, Austria, for example. And as I said, when you go beyond them… You should be able to utilise them as much as possible, but when you go beyond them, you lose time. So it shouldn't be the white line necessarily. But anyways, it's not for me to decide. Yeah, well, I mean, firstly, it wasn't that I support Andretti. I think from a driver's perspective, it's exciting to potentially see more cars. And then the idea of an 11th team… You know, we have over 2,000 people in our team. So that's, that's a huge amount of jobs. But we have to make sure that the criteria, which is quite strict is really respected. And I feel like we need to amend the criteria actually, and make sure that there's an opportunity for real impact, really making sure that if there is a new team, they have to be diverse. They have to perhaps create an opportunity for a female driver to come through. And it has to be diverse from the top up. At the moment, it’s all white owners. And there's a real lack of diversity from the top down. It's all male, and that needs to change. So yeah, that was just that's my thought. But I really do have 100% faith in Stefano, who I've known for a long, long time. I think what he's doing at the top, there's no one that could do a better job than him. And I know that he will make the right decision. Moving forward, he's a racer, and he's passionate about the growth of the sport, so happy to leave it in his capable hands.",Qatar,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, thank you very much. It feels pretty special. Definitely. I’ll remember it for a very, very long time. So, I can’t thank the team enough for giving me this opportunity. There’s not many people in the world that get this opportunity in their whole life and I’ve managed to have it in my first season, so thank you very much to the team. It wasn't my best race ever but it was enough to get a trophy at the end. So, super-happy. The move on George. I knew I had to try to get past, otherwise I was going to get stuck for a while. So, yeah, that one was a bit close – but our pace after that was very strong and I think in the second half of the race I got more into a groove, more into a rhythm and the pace was a bit better. So yeah, very, very happy, and excited to try to get some more. Yeah, it's definitely been a pretty special week. Yeah, obviously with the announcement of the extension and then, yeah, qualifying on the front row yesterday. First podium today. It's been a very fun week. So I’ll enjoy it. There’s still a lot to learn and try and improve on but yeah, I'll enjoy the moment for now. Yes, and no. I mean, it's special wherever you get a podium, I think. To get the first one, I don't think it really matters where, it's always going to be special. You know, I think for myself, it probably wasn't my strongest Sunday. So you know, from that side of things, there's still a few things I want to work on. But no, to get the first podium, like Lando said, on pace as well is a very exciting moment. I just wasn't quick enough at certain points of the race, I think. You know, these high-deg races are probably the biggest thing I need to try and work on at the moment. I think it's still quite fresh for me, obviously. In all the junior racing before this there are no races like this. So the only way you can learn from it is by just doing the races. So, definitely a few things, had I had this race again, that I would have done a bit different. But that's all part of the learning. So, yeah, exciting to know that we can finish on the podium, even if I feel like there's more to come. Well, looking back on it now I was in the perfect position to emulate Senna and Prost, like, literally perfect. It's true. But no, I saw I got a good launch, got a bit too excited on the throttle pedal in the second part of the start and at that point I knew I wasn't far enough alongside Max. I could see Lando was coming around the outside. So yeah, I think settling for third was definitely the safest… and just the safest option at that point. Yeah, it's definitely significant, you know.  You never forget your first podium regardless of whether it's been a strong performance or not. So yeah, it'll be a special day and I won't forget it and also ticking the first podium off the list is always a nice achievement to have. So yeah, definitely some things I want to try and improve on and still work on but yeah, for now I'll enjoy the trophy. I've been drowned by Lando in champagne which is a nice problem to have. And yeah, try and work out how I can do better next time. Yeah, just I think the tyre management and just pace at certain points of the race was not as strong as I would have liked. The first stint it felt like everyone was driving extremely slowly and then when I tried to push a bit more the tyres didn't really let me go much faster. So a few things to work on there and yeah, just pace overall in the races. And like I said, in these kinds of races there's no easy way to learn apart from just going through the races and having an experience where it's good or bad. So yeah, I think pace, I think the one lap pace especially in last few weekends has been a good improvement from the start of the year but definitely, in these kinds of races, the race pace is still an area to improve. Yeah, I don't know, I was just happy to be a guest.",Japan,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, another amazing day for us. A P2 and a P3, couldn't have asked for any more, the team did an amazing job. My start was very good, I almost had Max – but Max is Max as well, so I didn’t have a lot of chance into Turn Two. I tried, but the pace was extremely strong today, comparing to everyone. We’re not close to Max but we’re not miles away either, so it was a very good day, I’m very happy. Also for Oscar, his first podium in Formula 1, so congrats to him. We’re pushing. We’re getting there. The progress we’ve made is pretty outstanding. Like I said, I’m very proud of the team, the steps forward we’re making every weekend. I’m sure there’s going to be some tough times to come but we’re getting there step-by-step and our first double podium together with Oscar, so yeah, a good moment for us. A lot less stressful. Especially the last five or 10 laps. But just I'd say better, because we have two cars on the podium. So from a team side of things, yes, I'm much happier. You know, our first one since Monza a couple of years ago, a few years ago, but probably, in a way, our most deserved in terms of we’re there on pure pace. Nothing had to go our way. We're just where we deserve to be, so yeah, an incredible day for everyone but also for myself. Things went, maybe not always to plan, but the pace was extremely strong. Couldn’t challenge Max. Maybe for half a car I actually got into lead for maybe half a second so I'll take that. But, yeah, in a way, it feels better, because the pace was stronger. I could push and we were where we deserve to be, so a good job by the whole team to execute a perfect race. No, I was I was expecting him to probably lap us two or three times! And he didn't, so… I mean, I was expecting probably a bigger gap. I think we all were, as a team. And I think it would have been a lot closer, I lost eight or 10 seconds behind Pérez under the VSC. I don’t know how hard Max was really pushing. I'm sure he could have gone a bit quicker if he wanted to. But to be only 19 seconds behind, he didn't get a free pit-stop, which was lovely. And, yeah, I think it's just signs of our progress. It’s a track which has suited the car very well. I've been very comfortable since Friday to push and get in a good rhythm. And I think that's probably one of the most important things here, to feel comfortable with the car, get in a good rhythm. And I could do that yesterday. And I could do it today. And that shows with our speed we were able to perform. So yeah, another podium for us. Great result, load of points. So very good. How many? Yes. I didn't think it was that close. But yeah, if it's 49, then I definitely think so. There's not many races left. I'm sure there's going to be a couple where Aston are going to be a bit stronger. But I think our advantage at the minute comparing to almost every team, bar a couple, is we have two drivers who are up there fighting for these positions and fighting for this points. And not every team has that at the minute. So I think that's helping us. We can help one another, we can use one another, and I think that's a good advantage we have over a lot of other teams at the minute. So we're on an upward trend. We're making good progress and days like today prove exactly that. Even though I know there's going to be maybe some tougher races coming up at times and maybe not as straightforward as today but the progress we’ve made this season has been pretty incredible from my eyes and from where we were, to finishing 18 seconds behind the lead or 19 seconds is I think evidence of exactly that. So I'm proud of everyone and we'll keep pushing. I have no idea. I don't know what… he must have had a problem, right? But the thing is you can't overtake under the VSC unless it’s obvious the guy has a problem and I don't know what was going on, I didn't know if he had a problem, whether he was just backing me up. I didn't know and I couldn't take the risk of just overtaking him. He was going so slowly and then when we get the flashing dash for the VSC ending, he went into first gear and then I was on the outside of him because he was going so slowly, and then he almost crashed into me. So I honestly have no idea. I was shouting in my helmet. I was swearing quite a bit, but just got… I was so confused, I didn't know what I could do. I'm losing time to Max. The Ferrari guys were, I think, 1.4 seconds behind me after being I think 12s or 13s,  so I lost 10 seconds. And I didn't know what I could do at the time. If he has a problem, he should pull over and make it obvious that he has a problem. So he didn't and therefore I couldn’t take the risk of passing under a VSC so no idea. I don't think it would have changed the world, just made me stress for a little bit more. But it would have been maybe just a bit better to put Max under a little bit of pressure at least, after that. I don't think we would have been quite as far behind. So yeah, a frustrating time, maybe I'll ask next time what you're allowed to do but I think I did the right thing so all okay.",Japan,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Thank you very much. I mean, unbelievable weekend, of course. To win here was great. I think the car was working really well on every compound, but of course the most important was also to win the Constructors’. So, very proud of everyone working at the track but also back at the factory. I mean, we are having an incredible year and I’m very proud of everyone. Yeah. Only the start probably. A bit too much wheelspin but after that, it was quite a straightforward race, luckily. Yeah, I think it was a good race. Of course, the start was a bit tight in the first two corners, but after that, yeah, the car was very nice to drive again. I could really look after the tyres well, the degradation was quite in control. Of course, I knew that our strategy was going to be a little bit different with the Medium tyres, compared to two times Hard for some others but it was still OK, I think. The balance was still quite OK, traction and stuff for the whole stint. So, yeah, honestly, like no real issues throughout the race, and I think that just sums up the weekend as well. It’s been an incredible weekend to drive the car. Difficult to say. It’s been a really good weekend but I’ve had some other weekends I think also where the car has been really nice to drive. I mean, sometimes it’s not only your car but it also depends on the competition of course, how big of a gap it is. Yeah, I saw on the right mirror that of course Oscar had a little bit of a jump on me but at the same time I saw in my left mirror that Lando had a real jump on me and then I tried to, of course, close off Oscar but then, I mean, he was still there and I saw on the left-side Lando coming with a lot more speed. He then moved a bit to the right and I was, like, I can’t go more to the right! So I was, like, trying to get straight and yeah, luckily of course, nothing happened. It all got quite close but that’s racing. That’s how it goes at the start, and then, of course, we had a good battle also into Turn 1, into Turn 2. I was lucky, I think, that there was a bit more grip, I think, there was a bit more grip in Turn 2, just on the normal line, instead of trying to go around the outside. It’s better, for sure. The car has been more dominant this year, apart from Singapore – but all the races we’ve had a really, really good car. It’s just an incredible season for everyone involved within the team and yeah, just very proud to be a part of it but also very proud to be working with all of these amazing people here at the track but also especially back at the factory as well. These people you might not see at the track but they are doing also a lot of hard work to make sure that our cars are always in the best shape, get developed throughout the year, and also be best prepared for the year after. I think just everyone knowing their role very well and, of course, being good at what they do. But yeah, just communication and people working together to achieve a result like this. I think the car’s just better this year. I think the people are pretty much in the same spot and we know that they're good. So it's about just working with an even better car, I think,  this year, a bit more predictable, I think as well. Except Singapore, but like all the other races it’s been very predictable and just nicer to drive, I think. Yeah, I don't even know who came up with that because I don't even like podcasts, they make me fall asleep. So I don't know. Maybe we can call it something different. Or come up with something a bit more fun. You can be a guest of anything. Yeah, it's nice. I think it's natural, right, when you see some footage of the race and you talk about it as drivers too quickly when you see some shots. Nowadays everything gets recorded. Fortunately when the camera’s there can’t say everything you want to say.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean first I want to say a big thank you to all the fans, supporting us already the whole weekend, everyone being so passionate about Formula 1. So thank you very much for coming. From our side, an incredible weekend so far, and especially in qualifying, where you can really push it to the limit, it felt really, really nice. Yeah, we had, of course, a bad weekend in Singapore but I already felt from the progression we had that this was going to be a good track. But, of course, you never really know how good it’s going to be but from lap one it’s been really, really nice. Of course, you try to find little improvements here and there, and I think we did that. To be on pole here is fantastic. I still need to double-check. I walked here… Alright. Thanks! Yeah, to be honest, the whole weekend has been really good. As soon as we put the car on the track, it's been very enjoyable to drive, very predictable, which I think is the most important. And, yeah, lap after lap in Qualifying as well, it was getting better. I mean, I only had three new sets of tyres, so I had to be a bit careful with using them, basically. So, in Q2 I had to run the scrubbed. But then, once I put on a new set again, in the first run in Q3, it was just super nice. I mean, these high-speed corners, if the car is very well balanced and you can really push it to the limit, it’s just really enjoyable to do to drive. It's always difficult to judge but after FP3 I was like, ‘they’re quite close’. But then luckily, I think yeah, we made some tiny adjustments and I think it helped the car a little bit. And then probably Sector 1, once you feel very confident with the car, you can push it a little bit more and that's what happened in qualifying. Yeah, he told me a ’28 would be nice. I said, “don't worry, I'm going send it,” and then he was like, “yeah, but don’t shunt the car, right?” I was like: “yeah, well, obviously, that's not what I want to do.” I knew that there was still a little bit left in a few places, and that's what I tried to tidy up, which worked out quite well. Zero. Singapore didn't happen for us? Yeah, I mean, the car is quick, over one lap, I think also on the long run it’s quick. It's still a decent amount of laps and quite a bit of deg on the tyres. So just need to look after them during the race. But yeah, the car normally should be quick. That was the aim, especially coming from Singapore. I wanted to have a really strong weekend. And of course, we know that this is the first proper opportunity to win it. So we also want to do that. Honestly, yeah, we had a bad weekend; of course then people start talking about… ah, it's all because of the technical directives. I think they can go suck on an egg. But for my side,  yeah, I was just very fired up to have a good weekend here and make sure that yeah, we were strong. Yeah, of course it was on the limit but it felt in control and that, I think, is very nice when the car just does exactly what you want it to do. So yeah, just really, really enjoyable. There are a few sectors where… like Austin, you know, is also very quick, but here, I think what makes it very special is that there is no runoff, so if you have a moment you're going off. In Austin, you have the runoff and tarmac and normally it's a bit more forgiving. So  that's why I think this track is really beautiful to drive once the car is planted I was never really a fan of anyone. I appreciated everyone's success and yeah, from my side, I was like…  I want to be there one day, I want to stand on the podium or win races. But I think everyone's different, everyone has a different way how you get to Formula 1 anyway,  a different upbringing. So there are a lot of factors that come into play and that's, I think, the beautiful thing about Formula 1, everyone is different because if everyone would be exactly the same I think it’s quite boring. But yeah, of course the success of some of the greats… I mean that's amazing. You might get a little bit of inspiration from it but I wouldn't necessarily want to try and do it the same way if you know what I mean. But anyway, the world is changing every time right? Every different era so you also have to take that into account.",Japan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, the first lap was pretty solid. I was quite happy with it. The last chicane I could have done a better job but yeah, it was a good lap. On the second lap, my first sector was good and the next two sectors not so good, so no, happy to end it in P2. It’s been a really good weekend for the team so far, got upgrades on the car, and yeah, here they’re quick and we thought we might have decent chance around here but no, still got to make it happen. So, happy to be second, for the team to be second and third. Very, very happy. Yeah. It’s the first time I’ve started on the front row for a while. So, it’ll be cool. There’s only one car ahead to overtake, so I’ll try and make that happen. Yeah, very, very happy. You know, I think yesterday, we thought we could be in for a solid weekend. And then I think this morning we made some good changes. And the car looked quick in FP3. And I was getting more used to the track too. So yeah, very, very happy to be on the front row. Of course, the gap is a little bit or a lot bigger than I would prefer. But yeah, I'm happy to be in second. Yeah, there was a bit, I think I was about two tenths up after the first sector, but I wasn't going to find six. So yeah, in the end, it didn't make much of a difference. But of course, you know, when you're up on your lap before, of course you want to keep going that way and yeah, just a little bit frustrated that I didn't manage to improve on the second lap. But in the end it didn't matter. I think the strengths are still the same as it's always been, the fast corners, the high-speed corners where we can really just commit to the grip really. We still struggle in the same places I think. The upgrades, of course, are in the right direction and have made the car quicker but we still need some more steps evidently to be the quickest. So yeah, it honestly doesn't feel that much different to Singapore. I think the circuit is so different as well that it's hard to tell but clearly it's not too bad. We’ll try. I mean, we tried our best and Silverstone, so we'll try and do the same thing. But obviously it's going to be difficult. I think it's going to be a very difficult race tomorrow as well. Very different to Silverstone in that regard. So yeah, it could be a lot more open, I think. I mean, it's nice to have that, obviously. There's not been that many Australians in F1, full stop. But yeah, it's of course not a record I'm trying to chase, being the fifth front row from Australia. But yeah, it’s nice just to have that success, I think. And I think, in particular, so early on in my F1 career. Some people don't get this opportunity in their whole career. So for me to have it in my first six or seven months is a privilege. But yeah, of course, I want to try and be the next Australian to break some other records or be added to those lists. So yeah, a nice start, but of course, I want to be able to do more. Even through qualifying I was still trying to work on things. I think it's just natural for everyone… the grip comes up but I think overnight I was more happy this morning in FP3, a little bit closer and just feeling a bit more comfortable. I think if I came back next year I'd probably be more comfortable again so it takes a while, especially around here. I had quite a big moment through the first Degner yesterday and it took me a few laps to get back up to the same speed. So it definitely bites but yeah, I feel it's taken all of Friday and most of today. Yeah, I think yesterday and the whole weekend, just the degradation has been a lot higher than say Silverstone. Yeah, just looking at the tyre choices from everybody, clearly I would say most people are expecting more than one pit stop just from the number of… Max saved three sets of softs and the rest. Yeah, so he's doing a four-stop tomorrow! So yeah, it's just going to be a very different race to Silverstone from that aspect, and I think whenever you've got more deg, more pit stops it just increases the margin for error. It tests how well you can manage the tyres as well so it's not as simple as just going flat out or as quick as the car will let you so yeah, that was all.",Japan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Sure, first of all, a quick hello to everyone watching. Yeah, it’s been a very good day for us. As a team, a P2 and a P3, a great job by Oscar today and, as usual, by Max, but a good day for us. To be P2 and P3, I was pretty happy with my laps. Tricky, it’s not an easy circuit to put everything together always, but it’s so quick around here, the smallest mistake can make a bit amount of lap time, you know? I’m happy. It’s been a good day, good positions for tomorrow. Yes! Some of the most amazing McLaren stories come from here in Japan. We are of course hoping for a good result tomorrow. We want to continue that tradition but it’s going to be difficult. Max is doing a very good job, Red Bull are always doing a very good job, so we’ll do our best to make their life difficult and have a good race tomorrow. I mean, not a lot to talk about. I think we're very happy as a team. Also, for myself, I'm pretty happy with the improvements we made. But I think all weekend we've been strong, from FP1 onwards, the car has been feeling good. We've made some good steps forward throughout the weekend as well. And I think that's proved, to be ahead of Ferrari. I think we thought it'd be close with Ferrari, so to be ahead, and have two cars ahead was an even bigger bonus. But like Oscar said, I think we would have loved to have been a bit closer to Max. But it proved not to be the case. So yeah, a good day. Not bad. I wouldn’t say they were not my best laps. I think there were some very good laps but just a couple of things may be holding us back a little bit. But otherwise, we're happy. We're going to try. I mean, if he's leading by Turn 2 there's not a lot you can really do. If you want to emulate Prost, Oscar, into Turn 1… I mean Ayrton Senna into Turn 1 you can do that happily! It would be lovely for me! So yeah, I think we'll try. I think our race pace is decent. It’s definitely not going to be as good as the Red Bull here but we’ll do our best. Yeah, not much more from that. I think just the knowledge of our general pace and competitive pace… Mercedes are always very strong on a Sunday. But I think we've been strong all weekend from qualifying runs but also high fuel runs. So I think we're hoping for probably an easy race but it's never going to be an easy race around here so like Oscar said, just with undercut powers and things like that, I'm sure there's going be a lot going on.",Japan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, first of all, the track layout is amazing. It’s my favourite track. So I’m just really looking forward to driving here on track. Seems to be good weather this week. So I can feel pure kind of performance, Formula 1 as performance, here in Suzuka especially in the first sector. You know, like, last chicane is a fast chicane and, you know, that's kind of proper aerodynamic downforce corners. And yeah, also for the fans, as well. You know, like it's really far away, normally, from Japan, to feel any kind of support exactly. You know, I didn't expect… It’s always a surprise the amount of people supporting Formula 1, because, to be honest, it's hard to know exactly the amount of people watching Formula 1 from Japan but yeah, even yesterday, even to two days before I went to Tokyo and did a couple of promotions and stuff and I saw lots of Formula 1 fans there and I feel I got a really warm welcome from them. So yeah, so it's nice to be here and looking forward to it. No, I was 16 years actually Ah, OK. You mean the track itself? So as a spectator, maybe earlier, yeah. So I think I was maybe 14, 13 years old. I think I remember when Seb was driving with Red Bull. I think that was the first time I came here, Still probably the engine sound was really loud. And so I remember I was wearing kind of earplugs. It's incredible. For me, it's the best place to watch Formula 1 from the outside, especially around Turn 1, Turn 2, even like first Sector. I can see the Formula 1 car going into the corners with a sparkling kind of a yellow spark. And I can see how fast they are. And I feel always impressed. Also Turn 7 and Turn 8, the Degner curves, that place is just incredible. Nothing I think. I just probably thin… I just put down like just unfortunate, especially Monza was things I couldn't really control. Singapore, obviously there was a bit of room to improve myself but also just didn't work out in the end, just things that also happened that I cannot really control as well. So I just reset. I take it positive, just hopefully I digest every bad luck from there. And yeah, hopefully I can have a good race week here. So just reset and think positive. The car was good in Singapore. I think also the car itself, the characteristics of the Singapore track, anyway, was probably suiting us anyway. When we see Baku, normally we're fast there, it’s a kind of a mechanical grip track and we're quite fast. We see here I think we can see proper aerodynamics, if we actually gain from the aerodynamic side from the car. So yeah, if we perform well, I'm quite, you know, optimistic for the second half of the season. But we’re expecting good performance here as well. So yeah, hopefully we can put it all together and aiming for good results. Japan loves you. Yeah, so we’re speaking already. It's not confirmed yet. But I don't know, to be honest. I think both perspective have positives. Daniel brings definitely more experience. And he showed a lot of feedback, comparison, he's got really good kind of… Yeah, he definitely can tell more details about the how the car is behaving. So I think it helps a lot for the engineers. And I think engineers like it, especially how he talks and how he helped the development side. So if the team wants to develop the car more to be competitive, maybe Daniel. But at the same time, Liam, I think he showed in the first three races that immediately he showed the good performance. And probably he's still progressing. So on the performance side… Obviously I’ve just done, with Daniel, two races, and it was not really probably the best time for AlphaTauri as well. And in the last two when Liam actually came into the Formula 1, the car was pretty good – Monza and Singapore – so actually, he had a good time as well. But at the same time he definitely perform well. So yeah, I think AlphaTauri itself, we know it's like a junior team. So yeah, I think there is a bit more risk [in that] if we think about the results in general, so… Yeah, depends on what they are thinking. You know, if they want more results. probably Daniel would probably be more easier. He has more experience, especially, maybe, he can extract that results maybe, but also Liam, you know… I don't know. I probably… It's hard. I'm scared to say… I think Liam also [got] the best score, you know, he got ninth. I’ve never done ninth. So I'll stop here. Maybe, Liam and Daniel. Three seats! I’m quite scared now, talking about drivers line-ups! We’ll see. Obviously for me now it’s Red Bull family, so it would be nice if I’m part of Red Bull. And yeah also about Honda as well, so see how it looks like. But yeah, I think same copy/paste as them. Both! Both definitely. I mean, Honda has supported me from 16 years old. Actually started from this track. So without them, obviously I'm not here – but same time, without Red Bull, I'm not here as well. So, it's hard to say but they are different. I think they combine very well as a junior category, when I was a junior. They helped me in both ways and it's balanced actually really well. So definitely both. We’ll see soon. You’ll know soon. I don't want to really talk about like Singapore… but in general to be honest it feels like I'm quite getting consistent penalties, to be honest. So yeah, but it is what it is. I spoke with FIA actually in Monza, so I understand what they were thinking in general.",Japan,thursday,RB
Alex Albon,"I thought it would be younger than that? Six or 16? You should ask Yuki that as well. Yeah, of course he is. You know, it was a bit disappointing, of course, at the race last week, just points for us, especially, you know, as they come long and far away from each other, so not to be able to score points was a bit of a shame. But all forgiven. And you know, we're going into Suzuka, a track that should play a bit more into our car. But yeah, it was a bit of a… I think it was more disappointing because we didn't have many hopes going into Singapore last week and to be in a position where we could have almost scored points was exciting. And then I think, normally, as long as we kept it on track, we would have scored some points. But we didn't. Honestly, tyres aren't such a big thing. It's more just about the circuit itself. I think it's, kind of, low-braking, high-speed kind of corners around here. And that's actually a style that suits us. We've got some proto tyres to test this weekend. I think that's going to be quite interesting just to see, and give us a lot of mileage, basically, as drivers, to be on low fuel or get the most out of it. But yeah, honestly, not so different. Yeah, yeah, I love this circuit. I think it's actually my favourite circuit of the year. It’s kind of what Yuki said: it's that feeling that you can really drive the corners and really feel what it's like to drive a Formula 1 car, which sounds silly to say, but a track like Singapore, you don't really feel like you’re driving a Formula 1 car, whereas here just the speed, and because it's so tight, so narrow, there's grass either side, the immersion in speed, the feeling of speed is a bit more than you get, for example, at Paul Ricard so it's very special. Not as much as Yuki, that's for sure. But it's OK. It's not bad. It loves me? You love me or Japan loves me? Everyone loves me! Thank you. No, it's a great place. I actually would say Singapore was a bit more my home race than here but as Yuki said, apparently I'm welcome here. I love the food. I think I've gained about three kilos in the in the three days I've been here so. So that's been good. Sounds like Yuki Marko! Yeah, I think just as Nico said. Of course we are paying attention to it, I think it's more that it's the teams that are paying attention to it more than drivers. We’ve just got to focus on our jobs. I think it's as Nico said we will have our own stock and then it's our performances that raise or lower it. And then, that’s it really. I think more than ever this… I don't know, I haven't been in the sport long enough but it does seem like there's been a big push around 2026 in general from the whole paddock about keeping… there is a big move around then and that's when we're going to get the big Musical Chairs like Nico said. Lando, there, was pretty extensive and complete. Yeah, I think it's quite a tricky one because I think consistency is… we push on it a lot as drivers, I think as teams as well and viewers as well, but it's a tricky one. For example, you could take my incident with Checo, when he has a five-second penalty, it's consistent with everything else, but is it really fair? Maybe not. So I do think there needs to be flexibility in some ways. To answer the question about Max, same as Nico, I haven't really seen it but I do think things don't need to be as consistent as they are right now.",Japan,thursday,Williams
Nico Hülkenberg,"Is that so? 2019 didn't go so well. That was my last time here, but yeah, it's a cool place. It's a fun circuit. Definitely ranks very high on my favourite list too. And yes, it’s very different. It’s always exciting coming to Japan and spending a couple of days here. I think we all have, pretty much. I didn't see many other F1 faces. But yeah, obviously there’s limited time in between and, you know, Tokyo is always worth a trip. Be quick. You know, connect all the sectors, have a good car balance. Obviously, there are a lot of grip-limited zones, a lot of change of directions. It's quick and flowing, as we know. So yeah, I guess, ultimately, it comes down to you know how much grip you have and a good balance. I think it's quite challenging for us here this weekend. Singapore last week, I think was definitely one of our stronger weekends, especially recently. Think here this weekend, obviously quite different characteristics and I think they will challenge us. I don't know yet. Let's see, but I don't think so. I think it's just lifting. Yes. Neither, I think. It's obviously the same for everyone. But I think that neutral. It doesn't play a main factor. Obviously, it's high energy, high deg, therefore, and I think the soft compounds would really struggle here. So, you know, it's in line with what this circuit needs. I think there's still so much gap between now and then. I mean, sounds like quite a big change. And for sure, I think beginning of next year, you start to wonder about that. The Musical Chairs I think will move in and work quite a bit next year and I think naturally things will fall in place for people so yeah, depends what happens, how you perform and how strong your value is. You mean the pit lane stuff on Saturday? I mean, I've seen it. I know too little about it. What Pierre wasn't happy about it? He felt it should have been penalised – or what? I don’t know everything about it. I think it's a fine line there. I think Pierre is probably pushing for what you can do. But, I mean, they looked into it and yeah, that's it.",Japan,thursday,Haas
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, obviously very happy to have that announced already. You know, it was already around for next year but to announce it for the end of ’26 now is very exciting. Very happy to have my future secured for a long time in papaya. So I'm looking forward to it. I don't know. I mean, I've still got three years after this. But it's… You know, I think everybody… It's always nice to have a sense of security. And I think, for me, it made sense from my point of view, from a team point of view as well. So yeah, just that longevity and continuation together as well. Yeah, nice confidence for us all. It's been cool. I've been Tokyo as well. And yeah, it's been a really cool experience. Came to Suzuka last night and yeah, it's obviously a bit different to Tokyo, out here. But no, I'm enjoying it a lot. Tokyo I really loved, first time. So yeah, enjoying my time here so far. So, this was a long time ago. I did study Japanese at school for three or four years, but that was probably about 10 years ago now. So I don't remember much. But yeah, arigato gozaimasu, I mean, it's very, very simple. So yeah, I know a few words here and there, but not enough to say thank you. So thank you. And hopefully it's a good weekend. Yeah, I'm really excited. It's a circuit I've heard plenty of things about and obviously watched a lot growing up, being in Australia as this was one of the races that was actually quite friendly for me to watch. So yeah, I've watched it a lot. I've driven it on video games and simulators. It's always been a fun track. So I'm looking forward to getting out there tomorrow. Prepare your neck for Sector 1. That was the first piece of advice and yeah, obviously, there's so many factors here, you know. The wind can play a massive, massive role, especially through the high-speed corners; it’s a long race, a lot of corners where you put a lot of energy through the tyres. So yeah, a lot of factors. But your neck’s probably a big one. I mean, it wasn't a massive factor, to be honest. I think, you know, for me, obviously I'm still only, I think 14 races into my career. So, I think more just having a team around me that's very supportive, that were keen to have me in Formula 1 in the first place. To be able to continue that journey is the more important thing. And obviously, we've made a lot of strides and a lot of progress this year, firstly on the car and the team point of view, but also, they've been helping me develop as well. So, yeah, I feel very much at home and I think just continuing that for everybody involved was the main thing about that. It was cool. I walked it this morning. But I think any sort of like historic track where there's a bit more risk, it's a bit more old school. It almost, in some ways, for myself, it reminded me a bit of when I was coming through the junior ranks, on almost some of the British circuits, where there's a lot of consequences. It’s just a bit more old school. So it looks cool, the layout looks cool, but yeah, also I guess, it just bites you a bit harder, which, of course when it does bite, it's never fun, but it adds that element of risk and excitement.",Japan,thursday,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, first, I mean, congrats to him. I think any contract that allows you to be longer in Formula 1 is a great thing. He's performed, he's done everything he's needed to, and probably, I think, exceeded most people's expectations from what he's been able to achieve already this season. He's pushed me a lot. And it's not a nice thing. It's not what I want. But yeah, he's done a really good job. So congrats to him for another few years. And yeah, we've had a fun first half of the season. And it's a lot of progress. And I think for him to be part of that progress, and to hopefully continue that into next year. ’25 and ‘26 for himself, is going to be something to look forward to. The strongest. Yes. It's tough to say. I don't know. I want to believe so. I think everything did it was what it was meant to do. And I think we definitely took some steps forward. I don't think we're confident in saying we’re as quick as Red Bull. I think Red Bull will probably be dominant this weekend. But I think comparing us to Ferrari and Mercedes then Mercedes have been just a lot more consistent than what we have. We still fluctuate quite a bit. On a good weekend we can be very, very good and maybe a little bit ahead, like we've seen in Silverstone and things like that. But on the whole Mercedes have probably been the second best car this season, then Ferrari and then then us so far. We're getting there. It's still a very different circuit to Singapore with these upgrades. So there's all things for us to find out and analyse from Suzuka. Pretty much a guarantee. Yeah. There are always things every now and then. I would love to. I've always said I want to win with McLaren. And I think we're getting closer and closer to achieving that. And not just to win races, but win championships, both Driver and Constructor. I want to do it with McLaren. I'm very happy there. So if I was to spend 10 or 15 years there I'm not going to ever say no. I think that's something I would look forward to. But I’m very much just concentrated on this year, next year and ’25. I think that’s two-and-a-half years to try and progress and we'll see then. But things [crop up] every now and then but nothing more than that. I think quite a bit. Like Yuki mentioned and Alex, I think when you go to Singapore, it's still amazing to drive it into Formula 1 car and probably still quicker than any other car you can go around Singapore in but you don't feel the same speeds like you do here: you don't get that same feeling of what an F1 car is really capable of, because where it performs better than anything is high-speed corners. So yeah, I think a lot of it is about that. Also, the room for error is pretty small. There's a lot of consequences as soon as you go off pretty much anywhere. I know some places have changed, and there's a lot more Tarmac run-off, like in the Spoon corner and things like that. Maybe Turn 1 as well, but it's not changed much over the years, which I think is one of the best things about it. It's not just Tarmac everywhere, they’ve still got grass, you've got that bit of risk, that element of risk, which I think is always genuine, it always feels very natural and definitely adds to, say, a Qualifying lap, with how much risk you want to take. Especially through Turns 7 and 8, you're always a bit afraid of running too wide, things like that, because you know if you put a wheel half a metre too wide, it’s game over. So it's exciting. It definitely brings a few more nerves while putting a lap together and driving. But, yeah, probably one of the ones I look forward to the most every season. I think a lot of drivers do, They said it was their favourite ones and probably up there with one of my favourites too. So yeah, you experienced what Formula 1 Car is capable of and just whole experience of driving here is always a lot of fun. I don't want to say too much because I'll just create controversy. I think the blocking one on track should have been a penalty. He blocked someone: it’s not just down to the team. I know the team got the fine in the end of the day, but it should be down to the driver as well to look in his mirrors and see if someone's… you’ve got nothing else to do the whole lap but look in your mirrors and it seems like a lot of people struggle to do that. But I think, yeah, it should just be harsher penalties for blocking people, because so many people do it, it ruins your lap, it ruins your Qualifying. It put Yuki out in Qualifying and he was P1 in Q1. Probably would have been P1 in Q3 if he went all the way.  Just no one seems to care enough. It’s happened a lot this season, happened to me quite a few times, especially with certain teams – but it's also down to the driver to look in the mirror, like they got nothing else to do but hit the recharge button and look in your mirror and people seem to struggle to be able to do that in Formula 1, which is a surprise. But yeah, I'll probably block someone out this weekend and make myself look stupid.",Japan,thursday,McLaren
Sergio Pérez,"Well, that's definitely the target. We still don't understand fully what went wrong, or what went so wrong in Singapore. We have some ideas, but certainly this track is very different. So, there should not be a reason why not to be strong in Suzuka. Actually, they should be one of the best circuits for us. Yeah, we obviously have some good ideas on how we prepared the weekend and the misinformation we have, and where things got wrong. But obviously, it's something that we will keep internally, but there's some good indications that we probably approach the weekend with the wrong set-up. Once you are in the traffic, you're driven by traffic in Singapore, it's impossible to know. And obviously taking the tyres to the maximum life, being obviously on the different strategy to everyone else, to the optimum strategy, you never know. But the balance was feeling… I think we were more competitive in the race than we were in Qualifying certainly – but still, we were not that competitive. Yeah, it felt good. And it feels bad in Singapore already. So hopefully, it aligns well, and it can be a good a good track for us. It would be very special to do it here in front of all the Honda supporters. You know, they've been working extremely hard on the engine side as well. So, it will be nice to get it done this weekend. Yeah, I think the team is operating at an extreme level in all areas: on the strategy; on the mechanics; reliability issues and so on. Has been really on top form. Nothing to say on it. Not on this one. What should I say on this one? I pass it to you. Not wait for that long but it's something that probably in the future we’re allowed now. Yeah, we’re obviously keeping an eye to see but it's all so hard to predict what's going to happen. I think we’re all trying to get the best possible next contract we possibly can, where we think we're going to be most competitive at. But I think in my case, I’ve got another year of contract so I have no rush in that regard.",Japan,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, so Esteban and I had planned while ago, that while we’re here, we’ll get our remote control cars together and have a bit of a race in the pit lane. For me, it was very reminiscent of when I was a kid on Blue Peter, and it was really cool, because we all share, more in common than we probably think, other than the fact that we're pure racers. But it's very rare that we all get to do things like that, so it was it was fun. Unfortunately, yeah, I thought they were going to be electric. Yeah. But that's what our race when I was a kid. I raced electric and petrol and it was Kyosho. It's basically an evolution of the car that you'll see, like Senna had and I had the same car as Senna when I was younger. And he's mega at it. We were all spinning around – but I wasn’t far off your pace! I flipped it a lot of times! But I think I had a softer set-up. I have no clue. I would think that, if they're not 30 seconds ahead, like they have done in the past then something's up! But no, I think that as Checo said, it was obviously a difficult weekend, the last one, but their car should be phenomenal here. They’ve been phenomenal all year long. They've aced pretty much every circuit. And I mean, it's going be great to watch that car in general. Normally, you would come here and it’s beautiful to watch the laps that they do, because the whole team as a whole and the drivers are doing an amazing job with the package they have. So, it'll be interesting to see how the weekend goes. I hope that we are closer and I hope they’re not as fast as that 30-second gap they've had in the past. I don't know whether that's really the case. I think Carlos was managing at the front, and I think he was… we were relatively close, I would say, at the front. But what a great race it was. Just to have us all that close up front. And I think this weekend, I don't anticipate having the performance we had in the last race. But we've worked very hard to continue to try and push the envelope that we have. So, I'm hoping that we're not terribly far off this weekend. Well, I’ve got a terrible memory, but I don't remember saying it's my favourite. It's one of the favourites, I think, for all the drivers for sure. Just because it's figure of eight. It's that historic circuit where you saw Ayrton and Alain racing on many years ago. And it's it is an incredible track to drive on. And it's such a beautiful country as well. So, it's just overall a great trip. Great food, amazing hospitality. And then the track is just, yeah, it's one of the greatest layouts that we get to experience in the calendar. And so, I just hope that our car works. Yes, pretty much the same for me. I think it's exciting that we have this race, this battle at the moment. I think our goal was… just like them, we started off pretty poorly at the beginning of the season. Definitely didn't expect ourselves to be second in the constructors and to now be relatively close, particularly in the last couple of races… well, the last race and be fighting in the constructors, I think it's exciting for us as a team. And of course we want to beat them just as they want to beat us so it's going to take a full team effort, that's for sure. Are you sure? You always have an opinion on things. Are you allowed to park at the end of the pit lane on the way out? Just asking, because I didn't know. I don't really know what to say. I didn't really see them. Obviously I was in the pit lane when everyone stopped and I couldn't see what was happening up ahead. And we always push and work as closely as we can with the FIA to have consistency and there is some variation so we have to continue to work on it for sure. Well, we won't ever bin the car of course. These cars are still masterpieces, really, even if they're not. It's not the fastest car in the world. But no, 2000 people have worked so hard to build these things, and they will continue to be a part of our history and our learning curve. There will be bits of it that we try to change, try to hold on to some of the positives because there's always positives, good and bad sides, and so we're trying to hold on to the positives. And with the new direction we have it's far too early to say it than to be optimistic about next year's car because we are just in the process of going into that. But I have full faith in the crew that they're going to take it in the direction that it needs to go. There's been a lot of learning in these past two years so if we haven't figured it out by next year then obviously we will just keep working away at it. But I'm hoping that they have. Yeah, it's great, firstly, to have Seb back this weekend. He sat down and told all the drivers of his plans. It was great to see that he's found his purpose and - to be honest - in the history of the sport, I don't know any other driver that's ever had… or who's ever been so outspoken and showing real compassion for the world outside of this little world that we're living in and it's really great that he's utilising his platform. I always just hope that with the things that he's doing, for example, that he inspires the other drivers to do something along, maybe, in their own lane. But we all need to come together in this world to have a positive impact, to spread love, to spread compassion, to raise awareness for a lot of the problems that are.. and there’s obviously millions of problems that we need to address, but biodiversity for sure, is… when he's working with the bees here, raising awareness this weekend I think is a great, great way… just sparks a bit of interest and raise awareness for people to understand exactly what and how important they are in terms of our ecosystem. Ultimately it’s for him to… he's a grown man, so it's for him to go through his own process but of course, I support him both internally… I messaged him, as we do when we’ve both had difficult weekends just to say, wishing you… you'll come back and just try to shine a bit of positivity because we all know what it's like when you have a difficult weekend. I just signed my contract. Don't really know much about it to be honest. But of course in the not too distant future, I'll be looking at my contract to 2030. Yeah.",Japan,thursday,Mercedes
Esteban Ocon,"It was just a bit of fun. I was super-impressed, because he hasn't done it for years. And he was like: ‘yeah, start slow,” and all that. Because I practice a lot, like I'm constantly on it, and straight away, like first braking points, he nails it. So, you know, that's more than impressive. Yeah, he had a softer set-up. Not really more concerned. I think those things happen, unfortunately, in motorsports. It’s a painful one because we were going to score quite a lot of points and being very close to the top five as well in that race. And, you know, the car was suddenly very alive, and very quick, all the way through the race and I was very happy with the performance that we had. Obviously a premature end to our day – and my birthday! So, that didn't feel too great. But you know, we come here, a track that I love so much, had a great fight with Lewis last year, I finished fourth as well, so, you know, it's usually a track that gives us great performance, and I hope that we can repeat the same weekend. Yeah, we did bring some updates into Singapore, which made a difference really. The team did a really good job in comparison to Monza, which was a bit of an extreme circumstance. But, you know, we really improved the car and had much more performance, Qualified back in Q3 for a while and yeah, in the race, we were overtaking and were on the charge really, which was a bit… I'm not going to say unexpected, but it was in comparison to the other races. And that's really due to the hard work of the team, and each time we bring something, it has worked out. So yeah, we need to keep doing what we do. Keep focusing on ourselves and hopefully, that's going to continue well on the rise. It was incredible! It was very busy, of course. But yes, so many fans, so many supporters that I've seen. A lot of French flags, a lot of goodies and presents that I got also for my birthday. Since I arrived at the airport, it's insane. So yeah. And I've shown them also my special helmet for this weekend, which means a lot to me, because Japan has a special place in my heart , will always have. And yeah, my favourite track also is here. So that's awesome. I haven't seen the incidents I have to say. No, honestly, I was focused on myself more than on Max. Yeah, obviously we are a constructor team, so we hope to be able to improve in the future, that's our aim. We're not coming here just to be around and go backwards at all, that's not the mentality of the team in general. We want to push forward, we want to make progress, work on every aspect of our weekend, if it's the car, if it's the actions, the procedures on track. I've been quite a few years with this team. Every time we had an opportunity, we took it so we’re constantly working and finding out what to do with the car and the aim in the future, obviously, is to progress and go towards the front. Yeah. It's quite vague at the moment. Still, I don't even know if the rules are completely fixed. I heard some drivers tested these new cars on the simulator like Red Bull. Yeah, we've tested it with our test drivers as well in the simulator and had the first look but as Checo said, you can't really know the future, expect what it will be. But I think things will still change. I think for long tracks on the energy management, it looks quite tricky at the moment. So yeah, we don't end up in situations where one car has 30 more kph than the others. There's still a lot of time to figure out everything and see how it works. So yeah, we'll see later.",Japan,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"I don't know! There might be one. I mean, I'm lucky enough to be a Ferrari driver, so wherever we go in the world, we have a lot of support. But to come here in Japan is always extra special. The fans are so creative, so passionate. And they always come up with some crazy things on track. So it's always interesting and nice to be here. It's very difficult to predict any team's performance this year because it's just varying so much from track to track. We did not expect Red Bull to struggle that much in Singapore, we did not expect us to be that quick in Singapore. I hope the surprise will be a good surprise for us too this weekend. However, I think we expect Red Bull to be obviously in front and then to be a close fight with McLaren, Mercedes. It's been the case for the whole year and every hundredth makes a difference. So it's very difficult to predict for now whether we'll be in front or behind but we'll do our best to be the best of the rest. One thing that we did find for sure, since Zandvoort, is at least we have a good understanding of our car now. I think in Zandvoort we did quite a lot of tests and it's been super useful for the whole team in the two or three weekends after that, in order to understand a bit more of our package and that is crucial for the future developments especially. Then for the short term, I don't think that will help us to basically fight for wins all the time but at least we'll be able to maximise a bit more our package which shall be good as I was saying before, no? It's only a few hundredths with the Mercedes and McLaren so we need to be on top of our game every weekend. No, no. I don't think this will play a significant part in our competitiveness so no, I'm not concerned about the hard tyres. Yeah, at the end, I think as Ferrari, especially coming to this year, we finished second in the constructors last year so the target was to try and win the constructors this year. Then after the first few races we understood that this wasn't realistic because Red Bull is in a league of their own at the moment. So yeah, the main target for Ferrari is to come back winning as soon as possible. Having said that, looking at this season, the best we can do is second place and we'll do everything to achieve that. It's going to be tight because with Mercedes, also McLaren but they are a bit further away in the constructors, now all three teams are super close. So it's going to be an exciting end of the season. It's just unfortunate that it is for the second place and not the first one. Yeah, I was a bit surprised especially the one in the pit lane because that could open quite bad situations in the future. But again, as Lewis said, it's always an open discussion with the FIA and trying to explain them what our point of view is and improve and I'm sure we'll have that discussion tomorrow evening at the briefing. I didn't get the second question. OK. Well, of course, it gave a huge boost to the team especially after the first part of the season that we had. It was obviously a difficult one. To be honest, if you had asked me four, five races ago, I will have said that Red Bull will have won all races. So if there was one opportunity it was Singapore as they were probably not on top form. And the team has done an incredible job of being at the right opportunity, right up there. And Carlos did a great job too. So it's a big boost for the team and for the rest of the year, especially that it's been two or three races that we feel we are going in the right direction, that we are working in the right direction and to finally make this step and to win a race this year is a huge boost for the team. Then in terms of working with Carlos, I think we've always worked well and it was clear already from the Saturday night after qualifying, but probably even before qualifying that whoever was first - yeah, the second car will have to basically help the car in front. So this this was clear and yeah, we did a good job so I'm really happy that at least the team could win and it also motivates me and gives me an extra push in order to win one before the end of the season. Yeah, I think as drivers it's very difficult to know exactly where every team is at. Obviously, focusing on myself and with Ferrari, I didn't have the chance yet to drive it on the simulator and as soon as it will be the case, then I'll be able to tell probably a bit more. But yeah, for now very difficult to have a clear picture of who is ahead in terms of development or whatsoever",Japan,thursday,Ferrari
Valtteri Bottas,"Beautiful. Yeah, saw a lot. Yeah, actually, the first time I went to Kyoto and instead of going to Tokyo, I thought I would like to explore a bit more. It's really traditional Japanese city and actually the former capital of Japan if somebody didn't know! Like everyone, always look forward to it. It's a great track to drive and have great memories here. And yeah, it's just good fun, the flow it offers and like everyone explained already, the fans and everything combined. It's truly, truly unique Grand Prix. You're right. I think we always knew going into Singapore, that would be a bit more challenging to see big differences. We see that everything is working as it should, but in theory we should be able to extract a bit more out of it here because of the high speed nature of the track. And that's kind of what that upgrade was targeting. So it's going to be an interesting weekend in that sense and to learn more about it and to optimise better and hopefully that will be a bit more competitive. Yeah, I also haven't actually seen the incident so we need to have a look first to comment. No, I don't think so. No. Yeah, we definitely haven't made the steps that we wanted from last year to this year. And yeah, it's clear some teams made big steps but I'm not concerned that we don't have the resources. I think this team has… now that I've been part of it, I've seen it has become a lot stronger in terms of how it operates at the factory, at the races. So there's been a bit of reconstructing of the team also happening lately which will hopefully show a bit more next year. So I'm confident that everyone is in this together and really trying to get back to where we want to be and even further. So full confidence in the team. I heard Audi is going to be pretty strong in ’26. That's the rumour! But yeah, of course, like everyone, there's so many question marks. I haven't done any simulator testing either with the latest numbers so it’s still a bit far away but in the end, it will come quick and at least for Sauber, there's a clear plan what's happening and yeah, there's been lots of work done already for sure.",Japan,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, an incredible feeling. An incredible weekend. I want to thank everyone in Ferrari for making this huge effort to turn around and manage to win this season after a  tricky beginning – but now this weekend, we nailed the race, we did everything that we had to do. We did it perfect and we brought home a P1 that I’m sure all Italy, all Ferrari is going to be proud and happy today. Yeah, it was all about, given our limitations with tyre wear and degradation, all about managing the beginning of the stints to make sure I made it to the target laps that we wanted to do on each compound. Obviously a Safety Car forced us to pit even earlier than we wanted and I knew it was going to be a long stint on Hard. I had to give George… I had to get him slowing down, don’t give him a Safety Car or a Medium tyre opportunity – and it worked to perfection. It was just quite tight at the end – but we gave Lando a bit of DRS to help him and in the end we made it P1. I felt under control, to be honest. It was… I always felt like I had the head space and the pace in hand to do whatever I wanted to do. I’m not going to lie, you’re under pressure and you obviously are very close to making any kind of mistake but I felt under control, I felt like I could manage well and we brought it home. That was the best feeling, y’know? Over the moon right now. It’s difficult to pick one. Honestly everything. Everything. We have to be extremely proud of the weekend that we’ve put together. We’ve had one opportunity this year to win the race, which was here in Singapore, and we nailed it. We didn’t put a foot wrong all weekend and yeah, there was a lot of moments out there where we were a bit under pressure and we kept it calm, we kept our plan, our strategy. We had to play with tyre degradation, with pit-stop gaps, with DRS, and playing with all that, and managing to keep everything under control, we managed to bring home a win that was never easy, but that definitely feels incredible. Yeah, it was very difficult to tell before the race whether we would have the race pace to win but I felt like even if we didn't, by managing and controlling the gaps and controlling the pace and the tyre degradation, I could create myself the opportunity to win. Obviously keeping P1 at the start and then from there controlling the race. It was a whole plan and that Safety Car came a bit too early and going into a Hard tyre on Lap 20 wasn't my preference, especially because I had managed very well the Medium and I felt like we could have gone a lot longer. But it was the right call and then yeah, that stint on Hards was always under control until the VSC came out and gave the Mercs the opportunity to two-stop. And we were clearly under a lot of pressure there at the end. At the beginning, not so nervous because I felt like I had a lot of pace in hand to push the last 12-15 laps. But immediately, I felt like as soon as I started pushing, my tyre degradation started to kick in. And I think Lando and I were sliding a lot, then it surprised me quite a lot how quickly the Mercs managed to pass Charles and close the gap on Lando and me. And at that point, I thought okay, it's not going to be easy and these last five, six laps is going to be a fight. And at that point, obviously I had to change a bit the strategy. I had to give Lando a bit of a cheeky DRS boost, and that helped us to keep them behind and win the race and get the get the win for Ferrari that feels great. It's always tricky. Because you always put yourself under extra pressure, no? Because then you know that then you cannot have a lock-up. You cannot have a single mistake or a snap because it means that then Lando’s going to have a chance to overtake you if he's on DRS. So yeah, at that point you decide to give him the DRS, hoping that that's going to be enough to keep the Mercs behind. There was in particularly one lap that I think Lando defended into 16-17, and then I had to slow down a lot into T1-2-3 to give him DRS again. I think that move actually, saved my race, saved also Lando’s P2 because I feel like there, if not, I would have been also dead meat, if the Mercs would have passed Lando, I think they could have got passed me pretty easily. Honestly, I don't think it means much, I think this year, it's going to be a bit like this. We've had two great weekends in a row, but I think the two tracks that we've been to have suited our car. In particularly this one, a high downforce track. I'm incredibly proud of the effort that the team has done to bring a much better high downforce package here, and be much more competitive than in Zandvoort – but I still think there’s going to be tough weekends out there where we’re not going to be fighting for podiums, and we're going to get P5s, P6. We just need to make sure we keep getting those if that's the maximum that the team and the car can do those weekends. But what I'm more proud of is that we had one chance to win this year, and the team under pressure responded. I also responded and we managed to put together a perfect weekend in the one chance that the Red Bull and the situation gave us, and the speaks well of the progress that Ferrari is doing, we are doing in terms of race execution. Yeah, I think in terms of car and driving understanding, I think before the summer break there was this already decent feeling with everything. I just sat down with my engineers in the summer break and we said okay, what can we do to start putting the whole weekend together, because clearly we have a lot of pace, we were doing some good things but we are never putting the whole thing together, so let's see what we can do to improve that and start having consistent performances in the second half, because the potential is clearly there this year. And yeah, Zandvoort was a very good weekend, Monza was almost perfect and here I feel like it was the perfect one. Makes me very happy and proud that when you work, you analyse, and you also have the speed like I've had the this weekend. It is it is always paying off and now we managed to put everything together and, yeah, very happy for the engineers, for the mechanics, the team, everyone. I honestly don’t think the team bet on me. I think we were trying to do the best possible race for both cars, and that was coming by Charles obviously keeping a bit of a gap and a bit of a breather in case there was a Safety Car. That is exactly what happened, no? So, to be honest, this weekend, I just had a lot of pace and I was feeling at one with the car, and I had everything under control, those last five laps before the Safety Car, I managed to extract also a lot of pace out of those Medium tyres. I don’t know, I just felt comfortable, I felt everything under control and, of course, when you are the lead car, it’s always going to be easier. This is a sort of strategy that you always keep in the back of your head in tracks like Singapore, where it might come in useful at some point. The thing is, obviously, it’s easy to think about it, at least, it's easy to have in mind, but it's a lot more difficult to execute it because it does put you under some extra pressure and it comes with its risks. And it's all about having that commitment to do it and to put yourself under that extra risk. But I felt like that was my only real chance of winning the race and I wanted to win, especially when I heard that 1.3s/ 1.4s gap up to Lando after he defended into 16, to take the decision to slow down in Turn One and Turn Three. I was like ‘well, I hope these works’ because if not it could look really, really bad on me, but it worked. Some days you need to trust your instincts, trust your feeling. I've been trusting that, these last two weekends and it's working well. It always feels a bit better when you have someone that you get on well with and that you respect, both as a driver and as an athlete.  As a person, it always feels better to share those good moments. And don't get me wrong, I think if he would have had a chance to pass me at any point he would have gone for it, for the win, but I just knew that that 0.8s/0.9s gap was enough to know that we could play smart. But yeah, what was obviously a great moment and we were joking about it and having a good laugh about the weekend and yeah, enjoying the moment. I wouldn't be surprised if they're still winning the last few races of the season. I think Singapore gave us the chance and we just did well. But I still think the Red Bull is going to be up there in the remainder of the season and they're going to be very, very, very, very difficult to beat. I just think it's great for F1 if Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, Aston would be that two, three-tenths quicker every race, to challenge them in race pace. I think the racing this year would be incredible and it would be eight drivers fighting for wins, a bit like we saw today with four or five guys out there fighting for a win around a street track. So it just shows the potential F1 has to create an incredible show. But it's true that if Red Bull have nailed the car this year and they were doing such an amazing job they deserve to win everything that they're winning. So yeah, obviously dreaming a bit about what F1 could be if we would all catch up a bit on them and in this second half of the season and next year.",Singapore,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"It was. But Carlos was generous helping me get DRS. It helped my race, and also helped his. It was tough. We knew it was going to be tough as soon as the Mercedes boxed, especially with only a couple of cars for them to overtake. But we’re on the podium, P2, we held them off, we did everything we needed to do and more – so super-happy! I know. I hit the wall on the last lap at the same place. I did the same. I think he copied me! Just did it even worse. No, I feel for him, he fought a tough race, he was probably one of the quickest… he was the quickest today, I would say. So, it helped me a bit: the last couple of corners I could chill just a little bit more. Good points for the whole team as well with Oscar there – but everyone – Carlos, Charles, Lewis and George, we all pushed each other the whole way. It was stressful but it paid off. I’m good to go! Do it again! It was protecting P2. George couldn’t overtake me, he struggled to overtake me when he had a five, six tenths advantage, so the chances of me getting past Carlos with maybe a one-tenth advantage, there was no chance. Carlos played it smart. There was no need for me to try and attack him. The more I attacked him, probably the more vulnerable I would have been from both the guys behind and I wouldn't be sitting here, we wouldn't be on the podium if I played it differently, you know. So, it was stressful, stressful last few laps, for sure. I think we both knew as soon as the VSC came out, we had to put in a stint-and-a-half and try to open up the gap as big as possible. But they still caught us. And then it was about not making a mistake. I knew with George, he was going to pressure me a lot. He did and I had to defend quite a bit into 15, or 14. That's when Carlos backed off after that when there was a little bit of a gap and allowed me to get the DRS which was very helpful. So I think we together played it in a smart way to get the Mercs to stay behind us. The last lap then I had a bit more of a breather. I hit the wall, where George also hit the wall, but I hit it with the front so I kind of panicked a bit, thinking maybe I just messed it all up, but it damaged the steering, in terms of it was just off-centre. But luckily, it wasn't nothing more than that. So an amazing race, a stressful race from start to finish. A lot of management, but perfectly executed. I mean, he made a couple of mistakes. But no, I think our pace was strong. Honestly, I think initially I started to catch him myself. I think our pace was a bit better towards the end of stints. The Ferrari was probably better in the initial part of stints. So, I think that would have caught up to him ever so slightly anyway. I think I would have got into DRS. But it was more that when there was a gap, when I was most under pressure from George, that's when he most helped me out. So yeah, I guess it helped me keep him from not getting under pressure, from getting attacked, because I'm sure if I had got overtaken, Carlos would have had a lot more stress too, you know? But he drove a good race. Both George and Lewis and, of course, Carlos, drove a great race to not make any mistakes, not have any lock-ups or any of these things, and finish the way we did. Nope. If we went to Safety Car, we would have boxed, but VSC not. I think on paper, the Mercs were… if there was no traffic, they didn't have to overtake, the Merc strategy was way, way faster. If we weren't in a way, they would have been 10 seconds ahead of us quite easily. But there's always the task of overtaking, which in Singapore is one of the hardest tasks, and especially at the end. And with a couple of those attacks from George, I think he just put his tyres a little bit over the edge. And he didn't attack me as much after that main attack that he did. It's always a difficult challenge here in Singapore, the management and looking after the tyres, but you are kind-of a bit dictated to by the guys ahead of you. And, of course, looking in the mirrors to the guys behind you. But we had a perfect pit-stop to get ahead of Charles and a perfect strategy to get ahead of the Mercedes as well. So, the team did an excellent job today. I mean, he's always been very helpful. I've been with Will since 2018, 2017 in fact. He was my first engineer that I was introduced to and then guy that I worked with. So, it’s a good relationship I have with Will. And even Jarv [Andrew Jarvis], my performance engineer, he's come back after being away for three years. So, it’s our first podium together as well, which is nice. Actually, our first podium ever together, because he left end of ’19 and we went on to score a podium in the first race in 2020, in Austria. So, this will be our first podium together. But they've been working extremely hard. The whole team have and of course we’ve had the upgrades this weekend. So, I do have to say a big thanks to the whole team because the progress we made from where we were in the beginning of the year to now is quite exceptional, to be on par with Ferrari and Mercedes and beating Red Bull on a weekend like this. So, I’m proud of all of them. We know we have a lot more work to do, but it's paying off. I haven’t much more to add. I think Carlos has said it well, it’s always nice to be on the podium with whoever that you respect and get along with so the first time we've been able to be P1 and P2 – it's in the wrong order! – but it's alright for now. And yeah, I guess we had our first podium in Monaco, we were both there, so yeah, for Carlos to be on the top step is obviously great and he deserves it. He's done a very good job the last few weekends but to be up there too and to share it and yeah, just all of us, we've always got along since 2018, 2019 so yeah, always a pleasure and I'm sure and I hope there'll be more moments like it. No, I don't have much more to add. If Red Bull weren’t here, I would have had two race wins already! So yeah, I think  there's always been great battles. Sometimes it's the best of the rest pack. Now the best of the rest is… I wouldn't say it's just us, I don't think Aston are far behind and they were, at the beginning of the season, very close but they've dropped off. AlphaTauri were very quick this weekend, just didn't put it together when they needed to. I think it's great, I think that often if you didn't have the best team there, the best team always seems to kind-of dominate and take away the show from the rest of it. But often if you took away Mercedes a few years ago, when you take away Red Bull now, the battles for the rest of the positions I think would have been incredible: many different winners every race or every season. And even for us this year, if we could compete a bit more against Red Bull, Mercedes would have won, Ferrari would have won, we potentially could have won in Silverstone and Budapest. So yeah, I have dreamed a little bit but I'm sure, like Carlos said, they're going to be back on track next weekend. I don't know what they struggled with this weekend but when I watched his onboard yesterday, I kind of laughed because I've never seen a car that bad before. But yeah, Max also laughed about it. So, we'll see next weekend. I think they'll probably be back at the top.",Singapore,post-race,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, firstly, congratulations to Carlos and Lando, they did a great job today, their strategy worked. We rolled the dice this weekend, we went on with a different amount of tyres into Qualifying, with the option to be able to do what we’ve done today. I felt like it was a two-stop but I think the team did an amazing job today to really get us back up there. It’s a little bit of a shame about the first corner, but nonetheless I just kept my head down, kept pushing. And, of course, extremely unfortunate for George. We were pushing so hard to catch these guys and our tyres were so hot. But I know he’ll bounce back. He's been phenomenal all weekend. Yeah, this is how it should be. It’s incredibly hot. I think I only lost 2kg today, so it’s not so bad. Yeah, I think so. I mean, we needed to take the risk, have a shot at trying to get past some of these guys and going for the win. I think we had really good pace. So I think the team did a great job. I don't know, I think George was in second at the time, and maybe if I was in his position, I probably would have stayed out and at least kept the McLaren behind. But we gave it a shot. And it was really fun to be hunting these guys down. But as Lando said it was just too difficult to pass in the end. I mean, based on our times, I think I was about a half-a-second a lap up. But I think it was just… It's so difficult to overtake here, you need like, a second-and-a-half deficit to the car ahead. And what was really surprising is that the Hard hadn't dropped off as much as we would have thought but also our tyres dropped off a lot in trying to catch up the huge gap that were behind. I think Carlos today had really good pace. So I think I can't say that it would have been easy to have won today. But I think I think our car was very strong. I think if I had qualified better yesterday, perhaps third, or even on the front row with these guys, perhaps we would have been of course in a better place. And I think, as a team, we would have been able to work better together. But when you separate the cars a little bit more, it makes it really hard to work against two other drivers from another team. So, I've got to do a better job there. But I'm really grateful for the hard work that everyone continues to do. Great pit stops from the lads in the garage, and faultless in their performance through the weekend. And also, with strategy and everything. So, I think we are progressing. We’ve just got to keep working away. Well, we're all trying to be millimetre-perfect out there and it's very, very easy to make mistakes, it's very easy too for any us to have been in the position that George was in. He's been driving phenomenally all weekend, so it was really unfortunate for him – last lap – to finish that way. But he continues to grow, he’s continuing to improve so I know that he's going to keep getting stronger and faster and if there's any way I can help, I will be a part of that naturally in the next couple of years. But yeah, I have a lot of experience, I've been here a long time so putting together a race is… not that it’s easy but the race is where I'm most comfortable on track and yeah, I think it's just keeping your head down, it’s trying not to make… but if you look at last year for example, I made a mistake in Turn Seven and went off and crashed into the wall so it can happen to any one of us and it's just one of those things. I don't know what… I wasn't really watching much of others this weekend so I don't really know why they're off pace-wise. But I think it's great to see that others are… McLarens have picked up huge amount of pace, it's great to see that Ferrari have really stepped it up and I think it's a positive. I think, probably if you think about it, they haven't been developing. Obviously McLaren brought an upgrade here.  Others are bringing upgrades, they're working on next year's car. They have less wind tunnel time so then they're probably using some of this year's on to next year's. They would have definitely migrated before us. So no, I think it's just one of those things. They are so clear ahead that maybe they're developing their car less and we are still pushing to develop our current one. But time will tell. Jeez. Only 200. You guys haven't even done 196 races have you? Ultimately, I've been very, very fortunate to work with some amazing people, incredibly talented people over the years and so incredibly grateful to have been able to work with them and have the opportunity to have those podiums. I have no idea where we will be in the coming races but this weekend… we've had pace to be fighting for that top three this weekend. And it'd be interesting to see where it is in the next couple of tracks we go to. Yeah, I hope I can at least get another podium this year. That'd be great.",Singapore,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"It's extremely difficult, as everywhere, but here probably even more so, with the tyre temps and the overheating throughout the lap. It's always a balance between the first and the last sector. But yeah, everything was super close. Mercedes was really strong today, too. So it was an interesting qualifying. Unfortunately, I missed just a little bit to gain a few positions. But again, Carlos did a great job. One-three for the team tomorrow, and let's see what we can do. Yeah. The physical challenge tomorrow is going to be something for sure. It's extremely warm, extremely humid. But until now, we've had a very good performance. Honestly, we did not expect to be so competitive on a track like this. So this is a good sign for the future. But yeah, let's see what we can do tomorrow. I don't know. I think we looked quite strong all weekend. So hopefully we won't see that tomorrow. I'm struggling a little bit more – since the restart of the break actually – with the car. Quite a bit of understeer, but then also quite snappy. So difficult to predict what is the car going to do on the track, which I pay the price a little bit with the confidence I have inside the car. But at the same time honestly, it was a good lap. A small mistake in Turn 17 which cost me too much but apart from that I'm happy with the lap. It wasn't enough today, though. Yes. This for sure. The team has done an incredible job, as Carlos said, though, I think Singapore we've always been quick so we shouldn't get carried away. But it's a good step in the right direction. I think we understood a few things in Monza on a very different track, but we still understood things that I think will be helpful for the rest of the season. But I don't think it will do that much of a difference on every track. But it's good to see that we have a very good performance until now here. Well, I mean, Carlos is starting first, I'm starting third. So I think we can also put them under quite a bit of pressure. So, I’m not worried. In terms of overheating, it's a bit better. It would have been better if there was DRS to at least overtake a bit more but we don't have that this year. But hopefully we can be a bit closer than what we were in the past in the last sector. And hopefully, that will help overtaking. Of course, as always. I think we've got a good car this weekend, so why not? Again, Carlos and I have great starting positions. Now, let's see what's possible tomorrow. Well, again, this weekend, it feels particularly good and much better than the high downforce tracks in the past. As I've said before, I think we found something in Monza that should go a step forward but definitely not as much as what we've seen this weekend. So I think our car is fitting these track characteristics in particular. And, yeah, we shouldn't get carried away and I am not enough confident now to say that it will be the case for the rest of the season. Have we done a step forward? Yes. Will it be like that until the end of the season? It’s too early to say.
CS: I  can copy paste what he said. I'm pretty sure that if we look in the past there's always been one race where teammates collides at one point. So we are not looking too much into that. We are, as always, aware that we are teammates and Ferrari comes first and this will be the goal: to try and put Ferrari as much further possible tomorrow. So yes, we know we have a responsibility, but it's not like we are looking always what happens in the past. Yeah, he's doing an impressive job.  Already after Zandvoort we spoke a little bit and I was telling him how impressed I was because to do your first race in those conditions is probably a nightmare for anybody. So yeah, he's doing a great job and again, confirming it weekend after weekend, so yeah, congratulations to him. Until now, for sure, because they've never been as far as where they are starting now - on a street track also. But as George and Carlos said, we cannot discard them. So let's see but it's the best opportunity since the beginning of the season for sure. Yeah, I agree. I think in Monza the track is helping also those fights. But again, I believe the philosophy will be the same. If we are under pressure of Merc then I'm pretty sure that the positions will be fixed if we have all the other cars quite far behind, which I hope will be the case, then let's see, let's see what the team chooses. But at the end, we'll follow whatever we have been told.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Ferrari
George Russell,"It’s hot out there for sure. I’ve got a bit of a sweat on. Yeah, it was definitely a challenging session. When you're sat in that car, it's like you're sat in the sauna, just sweating it out. But you’ve got to keep your composure, stay cool. And yeah, really, really happy with this weekend as a whole. I’ve felt really confident in the car. The team did a great job with the strategy: we're on an offset strategy compared to everybody else, so we've got an extra set of Medium tyres tomorrow, which nobody around us has. So to get to Q3 and be on the front row with a strategic advantage tomorrow is an exciting place to be. Yeah, I mean, the track is different this year. The tyre degradation on Friday looked pretty bad. So I think it's going to be very close between a one- and a two-stop and with our Mediums we can put Ferrari in a difficult position and try and force them into an error and get the upper hand. So that's what we're looking for. Yeah, the car has been feeling amazing, this whole weekend. Huge credit to the whole team, they’ve been working so hard, put in a lot of efforts to maximise the car we've got, understanding it, looking ahead to next year as well: everybody's you know, given 100 per cent so really pleased to translate that into a really solid result today. And, as I said, it was really, really enjoyable. To be honest, since the break, I feel like I've been really hooked-up with the car. Set-up’s been in a great window, working really well with my engineers. Some say it’s the new hair. I don't know. I think it’s just good work and just enjoying it. Having fun out there. Yeah, to be honest, I think we were. We know that on the high-downforce circuits, we tend to go better. Ferrari always fast on the street circuits, C5 tyre. So we knew there'd be quick. Red Bull are obviously a big surprise, not too sure what's gone on there. Their long run pace didn't seem stellar, either. So yeah, this is a great opportunity, this weekend, to get a victory. We’ve got a different tyre strategy to every other car on the grid out there. We've got two Mediums. So, we're the only team who've got the chance to do a one-stop or two stops, so that really gives us a great chance for tomorrow. I’ll definitely be going for it. I think that will make our life easier. I think we've got the pace over Ferrari in the race but, as I said, we've got a strategic advantage over them. So, I'm pretty relaxed, even if we are P2 after Turn One – or even P3, because as I said, we're the only team who can do a two-stop race. Tyre-deg looks bad and I hope we're going to put them in a challenging position to fend this off. So, it brings…  I'm feeling good, I'm feeling excited. Nobody told me so it didn’t really changed my = approach heading into Q3 Just focusing on ourselves and maximising the result. But it’s definitely strange that they’ve been off the pace this weekend. Unusual. But as Carlos said, can't discount them ahead of tomorrow, even though it will be tough. I guess … I think probably after the first run in Q3, but it was… you always tend to look at yourself and the guys you're fighting, and this weekend has been the Ferraris, it's been Lando and Fernando. So, it's not that you discount them ever, but you're just looking at because you're fighting it and just for whatever reason they have been off the pace all weekend.
CL: For me, my engineer didn’t tell me either. So, just when I was in the box with the screens, I could see that they didn't make it through. That's it. Yeah, I think the fight will be with Ferrari. We can't discount Lando either, he's got good race pace. Their race pace probably looked a little bit ahead of Ferrari’s. But it's just going to be around that tyre degradation, around the pitstops. In all honesty, we're sitting here now, we don't know exactly how the tyre deg’s going to pan out but on a circuit that is difficult to overtake, you're going to have to bide your time and maximise it around those pitstops. Yeah, I think he's been doing a really great job to be honest. I followed him a little bit through his F3,  F2 career. Saw he was doing a great job in Super Formula and it's never easy to be thrown into Formula 1 as a rookie mid-season, no experience.  The tracks that we've been racing at haven't exactly been the easiest. I saw he did a good overtake last week in Monza which was pretty impressive. So yeah, he's doing a good job so not a lot more to say than that really. Yeah. Same.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, again, a bit like in Monza really, hitting the ground running from FP1 and feeling very confident all through the sessions and putting it together Q3. Just focusing on not doing any mistakes in that lap, keeping it clean around here in Singapore normally pays off. It was a bit of a messy session for everyone but we kept the focus, put a good lap in at the end and now pole position. Yeah, I think it's the story a bit of our year, you know, We have a very good car in certain tracks and in certain conditions like one lap, on these sort of short apexes, quick changes of direction our car seems to be very good. This weekend again, a bit like in Monza, we know our weakness, it's always a the race pace and it’s somewhere we always pay the price. But I think the team has been doing a great job over the last couple of weekends to understand the package understand the car. And I think we're definitely making a bit of progress keeping in mind that this circuit has always suited Ferrari quite well. Race pace? Bit of a question mark. It’s not like on Friday you can learn much. But yeah, Mercedes is normally a bit quicker than us come race day. They have a bit of a different strategy with the tyres that we will have to keep an eye on. But if I focus on my own race, put together a good first stint and a good stint on Hards, then I think we can still target the win. Yeah, that would feel amazing and that's the target. I mean, try to get the win tomorrow. I'm going to give it everything like I gave it in Monaco and hopefully tomorrow it’s enough. Yeah, it feels very good, I must say. I felt on it again since FP1, FP2, FP3, building it up. Again, another clean lap in Q3 with no mistakes. I knew I had the pace. I knew I could do it and just putting a clean lap together in Q3 gave me pole position again, which is an incredible feeling. And now more than ever it’s true that I want to get it done, no, not like in Monza, tomorrow we will try and get that win. Yeah, it's been, I think one of my strongest points of the weekend, really, keeping the rear tyres alive for the last sector. Yeah, again in Q3, I made sure that I kept that advantage going into Q3 because it's always easy in Singapore to over-push, to have a snap here and there and end up losing the lap. And yeah, even though I felt like I didn't take too many risks during that lap, I kept it clean and it gave me a strong last sector and it was enough for pole position. So yeah, very happy with it. Pleasantly surprised, because our last high downforce tracks, we've really struggled. We've haven't been on the pace. We've been third, fourth, fifth-fastest car and certainly since we arrived to Singapore, a high-downforce track we were clearly one of the fastest, if not the fastest. So it has been a very good progress. I think we've done a lot of work to try and understand our high-downforce package and the team has done a very good job to put it together for Singapore. But it's true also that this always, historically, has been a very good track for Ferrari. It's also been a strong track for me, I like driving around here and yeah, I think it's a good job well done. But it's also I think the track is suiting our car a bit more than Zandvoort, for example. A lot of confidence for sure. I'm not going to lie, I'm feeling very well with the car and I'm driving very good, probably the best since I've been a Ferrari driver and finally I’m extracting my full potential. And I'm happy to see that. I'm happy, too, with the work that I'm doing with my engineers to little by little keep extracting more and more potential and more performance out of the car. And it's obviously going to give me a lot of confidence moving forward. But yeah, we need to keep working on the race pace. In Monza, you could see what happened and tomorrow is another good test to see how much progress we've done in that area. I'm more confident, mainly because of the track layout. I think it's a bit easier to hold on to our track position. That obviously gives me more confidence than Monza in terms of pace, I really have no idea how we're going to be. Looking at long run data from Friday. the Merc, the Aston and the Red Bull did look a bit quicker than us in tyre degradation and race pace, so it could be that tomorrow we have to run, yet again, a bit of a defensive race. But I don't discount that even around this track we could hold on to a P1 because it's a lot more difficult to pass than other tracks this season, but our race pace still looks like our weakest point. I don't think you can ever discount Max and Red Bull. they might turn up tomorrow with a race pace that they've had there all season, and still managed somehow to make through the field. But, for sure, around here, they have a much more difficult task. And it's a much better opportunity than Monza, for example. I think tomorrow the race is going to be between the top five cars that we're starting. I think it is true that George has this extra medium tyre but we could also do a two-stop as the Soft didn’t look too bad. Yeah, I think it will be a tough race to manage, a tough race to put together but I think if we nail it, we have a great opportunity. And that's the target tomorrow, of course. My engineer told me the two Red Bulls were out and obviously it was not bad news to have. Also, more looking into tomorrow than today, as Qualifying any way it was always going to be a battle, yes with Max, but also with Lando, George and Charles. I think we were all very tight since practice. And it was really tight again in Quali. I thought the battle for pole position was not going to be affected too much but the battle for the win probably. And yeah, it was decent news to receive for sure. Yeah, my thing is always very small, incremental gains that you do during the season. It is true that in the summer break you always have a bit more time to relax, to meet with engineers conclude on the things that have worked, the things that are not working, where you need to put a bit more focus, where you need to keep working well and maybe just having the time to switch off but at the same time to analyse and to put together everything into second half of the season that's helping. And that's why probably these last few races have been a step forward and now the target is to keep it going until the end of the season and hopefully into next year with a more competitive car. Yeah, it's also three different drivers, different conditions. And trust me, I will not be thinking about that when the lights go out. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time to follow what other people are doing because we're so focused on our own car understanding and putting laps together that it is difficult to see and understand what what's going on in the other teams but by the looks of it and by the sounds of it, it looks like he's doing a very, very good job. And from here, obviously congratulate him because to be Q3 in Singapore is not easy, especially jumping in the car halfway through season. Yeah, up until now it is for sure. Well, first of all, I'm sure that the characteristics of the track is not like it allows (us) to have the nice battles and great wheel-to-wheel that we had in Monza, which again, was a lot of fun and a great battle. But I think this track is very, very different. And, of course, we will be looking into tomorrow to see everything that we can do to beat the Merc and to get the cars into one-two and I'm sure the team will, again, prioritise the overall team result and try to get the win.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, firstly, very happy to be obviously continuing with the Alfa Romeo team. And I feel like the work that has been done in the past and also the trust between the team also from my side is being extremely, let’s say, well and transparent together. So just very happy to be finally announced in Singapore. I think last year I announced here as well to continue for this season. So yeah, really happy and exciting for where the team is heading and to be taking more into this project, you know, for the future. So yeah, hopefully we can start  off the weekend in a good way. We're going to be taking part into the future development on next year's cars. I mean, the team is already starting on that project. But knowing me, staying in the team, I can definitely put a lot more effort into that and guiding together the guys at the factory, with Valtteri, together, to make sure that everything is heading in the right direction and to improve the weakness of the car and remain all the strong points. So yeah, I really feel, you know, getting everything done here, we can really focus on just continuing improving as a team, as a group of people, and from my side, just really happy to be able to settle more into Formula 1 and of course, next year we have the home race, so I've been waiting for that for two years already. I mean, it’s a nice place, and I think it will be forever a memorable weekend for me in Formula 1, because I grew up obviously watching, in 2004, the first race. Back home in China, it’s 20 years and now we're heading back next year. So it's going to be amazing just to catch up with the fans and with the people in the home crowd. Yeah, I remember that. I was actually waiting a lot on the marshal post, knowing the pit lane was literally one minute walk from that. But yeah, obviously last year was not great, I  haven't finished the Grand Prix here. So this year, I’m really looking forward to the new layout, first of all, and on the other hand, I do feel that we have some package here, so hopefully it's working correctly, for us a step stronger to our main rivals, competitors, and yeah, finish the weekend off in a nice way together. Obviously, it's settled for next year. So, 2024 I’m secured, and after that, obviously, you know, how the team is settled into another project so everything will be decided after that year, so to keep the options open. And on the other hand, I'm so excited to be going home because just the fans back there, they've been waiting, or a lot of them actually came here, even some other races they come to watch. But I think it's just different when you have the home race, which you grew up watching as a kid in the grandstands, braking or turning into Turn 1 I remember that first two years, I was in exactly the same spot, because I felt like you can see the start, where the action is, and then going back there as a driver [inaudible] and also, I think it's going to be just a sensational weekend, so yeah. I mean, I think it was very clear, you know, after a lot of teams announced their driver line-ups. Of course, you know, beginning of the year, I was just focused on my pure driving. And then halfway up or before summer I was looking for what are the options. And of course, there were other options. But for me, the priority was trying to stay with the team. And like I said, of course, this year maybe went a little bit longer than expected, just because we wanted to make sure we maximise all the little details we have together into the collaboration with Alfa. So yeah, for my side, I was very keen. That was my priority option for what was coming. And as we see, you know, it's not like we have a lot of seats available and I feel like I was very happy being in that happy place with my engineer and with a group people that I know already. To be honest, obviously, I have my targets before the year, I think everything was given before the season that they want to see me making a step, which was clearly up to the performance, making sure I tried to be as consistent as possible and try to always together match the similar pace of my teammate. And then yeah, from that side, obviously, it's up to them if they were happy or not, and clearly everything is working on both sides, we were very happy with what we were able to achieve. Maybe not so much in terms of how we finished off P6 in the Constructors’ last year, and this year has been a little bit more struggle. But I think in general, on my side, I was able to make a step but it's just hard to put that all together into the points at the end of the day. But yeah, I think in general, the object was able just to achieve on that side, but of course, we still have a long-term object we want to aim for with the whole team, also for the remaining races, because I think in a way, P9 in the championship is where we shouldn't be. And I think we can still, you know, making this step further up. Yeah, from my side, maybe Logan will experience that after the weekend but last year, this was my toughest race that I experienced out of the 22 we had last season. I think it's more, just like George said, the streets layout. The heat, humidity, and how much you're constantly turning the steering wheel, trying to focus on that. You don't really feel like… you know, when you do a good lap here in Singapore, you really can feel you nailed the lap. And yeah, you know, drivers always do extra preparation for that. I actually never drunk, the first half season but I did start drinking a bit of tea afterwards.",Singapore,thursday,Alfa Romeo
George Russell,"Yeah, it's getting very competitive and bumping into a few familiar faces. We reached out to the Padel, the local Padel court here, to see if we could get some courts after hours. The first night we did it was totally fine. The second night they said it's sold out after hours and when I arrived there I had Lance playing on the court next to me, then there was Lando and I playing and then on the other court was Pierre and Antonio Giovinazzi. So Lando and I had a good battle. Three-two in sets to team Russell, so I was happy with that one. Yeah, it was great to see the opening game of the rugby. It’s a sport I follow a lot. I've always been to the Six Nations in the UK. I would have loved to have seen England play but didn't get the chance to do that. But I was there with Ineos, watching the All Blacks and France go head-to-head and I was sat next to Richie McCaw. So that was a good experience, obviously a rugby legend, and hearing his views on the game and getting to know him. I think it's going to make the race a bit more exciting. I think Singapore is a really great circuit to drive, but it's a little bit challenging to race on. And historically, it's only really been Turn 5, which has been an overtaking opportunity, whereas now I hope maybe into the new Turn 16 there’ll be another chance. It’ll make it slightly easier physically for us, because it was obviously the longest race of the season in terms of time duration. So I think the track will probably be nine seconds or so quicker this year. So a bit shorter on Sunday. But as I said less fun in quali, should be better for the race. Last year, we had a really fast car and unfortunately we didn't make the most of it during the weekend. But I think it's so close at the moment between ourselves Ferrari and McLaren, Aston Martin are fluctuating in performance. Hopefully, we can close the gap slightly on Red Bull here, on the high downforce circuit. So I think it is that battle for P2 on the road. But you're going to have to nail every single detail because it's going to be by the smallest of margins. Nothing more to add, same as what these guy’s said. Yeah, I think we've made some good gains this season. In all honesty, there'll be a few more little things to come towards the end of the season, which will aid our learning into next season. I think it's clear that we made some mistakes ahead of the 2022 season, and again over this winter, but I’m definitely confident that these mistakes are going to aid us and help us a lot for the future. And, you know, you need those setbacks, and you need those errors to set you on the right path. And I think, as a team, we're incredibly motivated to get back to the top. And as I said, I think the lessons we've learned over these two years, will only help us in the years to come. I don't know why two years, to be honest. No, I think that was mutual between us both. And this is a long-term partnership between the two of us and we want to continue building on what we've built over the last couple of years, the lessons we've learned. And yeah, from my side, it was sort of never really in doubt and a bit of a formality really. When I signed, two years ago now, this was always the plan to be together, and hopefully, you know, try to keep this relationship as Lewis has done with the team and obviously, I could only dream of success like they have achieved together. Yeah, I think this is definitely the toughest one of the year. And, as Kevin said, I think a big factor is because you're constantly turning. It’ll be made easier this year with the layout change. But also, being on a street circuit, you get no airflow from doing the highest speeds like you would do in Spa or Monza: you get a lot of cool airflow when you're doing 300km/h-plus in the straight. So, that's another factor. But it's enjoyable. It's enjoyable to have such a challenge, and you never want things to be straightforward, week-in, week-out.",Singapore,thursday,Mercedes
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, definitely. I love a night race to be honest and I feel like it's a track… When I first started playing the F1 game a long time ago, this was the track I always came to. I don't know why. But it's exciting and I've always wanted to drive here. So I think it's going to be a special weekend.",Singapore,thursday,Williams
Kevin Magnussen,"Yeah, I think we were the weakest that we've been this year, I think, in Monza. It was super difficult for us in both qualifying and the race. So yeah, tough one to swallow. But we know that we have been lacking in development throughout the year, I think we started the year in a decent spot, you know. We were able to squeeze into the top 10 once in a while. And, you know, other teams have just made bigger improvements. Williams have made a big step forward. And, you know, obviously McLaren has made a massive step. But we're waiting for that step for us. You know, I think there's some interesting stuff going on in the background that we might be able to bring to the car this year. And I'm excited to see those things get to the car and try it out. No, I don't think I can confirm that. But it's certainly, you know, a lot of stuff that we're trying to bring to the car. Whether it’s B-spec or not, I don't know. But it's a lot of stuff and it's exciting. Hopefully. I don't know exactly when it's due to arrive, but hopefully sooner rather than later. Yeah, I think low downforce for us is not great. I don't think it's going to change the world that it’s a high-downforce track. I still think we are where we are. We're behind. We know that. So, every race we're trying to maximise our chances of some kind of opportunity with a safety car or any sort of odd opportunity that we can try and grab. We know on pace we're not there to score points. But yeah, we're still trying everything we can of course. Yeah, Singapore is one of the toughest, if not the toughest race of the year, just because of the humidity and the heat, but also because the track keeps turning, you know, you never get a rest. And because it's so low-speed it also extends the time duration of the race. So often it goes close to two hours. So it really is the one race where I think, you know, the tough days in the gym, you know, you keep going because of this race. You know this is going to suck if you don't work hard on your fitness. But hydration-wise, we do have drinks in the car, but it gets very hot, very quickly. So you kind of get the first, I don't know, 15-20 minutes of the race, where you can drink cold water and then it gets almost like tea, too hot to drink. So I don't tend to drink too much. And it's actually hard to swallow liquid when you're driving and being thrown around in the car. You need to be careful not to drink too much, it can get tough on your stomach. But yeah, it's a tough race for sure. No, I don't think so. You know, I got the lap record here because we had a terrible race and I had to pit at the very end of the race. I got new tyres with low fuel in the car, so you know, got a lap record there. Yeah, it was a smoking lap, for sure. To beat it this year? I think it's going be tough with the new layout. Sorry. Yeah, it's going to be beaten for sure. Whether I'm going to take it, I don't think so. I don't hope so, almost, because it means I'm going to have to pit at the end. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, it's happened twice. One of the times I got, like, some kind of fast food plastic on the front wing and had to pit for that. So that was great, but I got the fastest lap.",Singapore,thursday,Haas
Lance Stroll,"I think so. Throughout the year we've generally been more competitive on the high-downforce tracks than the low-downforce tracks. I think we struggle a bit on efficiency. So yeah, I'm hoping we can have a better weekend here.",Singapore,thursday,Aston Martin
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, I must say it was it was definitely very special to take a Formula 1 car around the small Le Mans track. Even if it was only two laps, managed to do a couple of doughnuts. And it was a fantastic event with over 60,000 people showing up there. And for a quite unique race and event. So it was definitely very cool. We expect it to be slightly better. I mean, obviously, very different conditions, very different track characteristic, more corners. We know why we struggled in Monza and some of the weaknesses. And I think it's probably on paper it’s a bit closer to a track like Zandvoort, where we showed slightly more competitiveness. It's not going to be night and day but definitely we prepared ourselves in the best way possible and I hope we were in the in the mix for the points. Usually more corners, the better it is for us, so I wasn't so keen. But yeah, I think the track is… I've always loved Singapore for how twisty and technical it is, in a way, so yeah, it's just two chicanes which have been taken away and no wide grandstand which is facing the wrong way there. So hopefully, they didn't sell too many tickets there. But yeah, apart from that it's still going to be very, very cool. Yeah, I guess he’s said it all. It's extremely humid and very challenging. So I hope you did a good a good training, good workout before coming here because if you didn't, it's a bit late. But I know you're working with Pyry (Salmela) so I'm sure this body is well looked after. Yeah, luck is  not really a consistent factor. It’s not really  going to affect it so much. Obviously it's a different car, different conditions, different track: everything is kind of different to what it was last year. So just approach it... I did my training same as usual. I did sim prep with the team. Obviously quite a lot of question marks after Monza because we struggled definitely more than we expected but yeah, we know we are ready for this weekend and confident we can extract everything out of the package we’ve got. His (Max’s) restart is slightly different. He doesn't need to think where he's going to attack; most of the time he's got no one in front of him so it's just about how am I going to secure my position?",Singapore,thursday,Alpine
Max Verstappen,"I think we just are not as competitive as at other tracks. I think the street circuits are a little bit tougher for our car. I still think that we can do a good job but it will be very tight. They’re fine. I mean, less braking, less steering, bit more relaxed. Yeah, it will probably be a little bit less but I am hoping that it also helps the racing. It will depend if we can get a DRS zone in there or not. I never really looked at number eight, nine, ten.  I just always want to do the best I can. So naturally, every single weekend, it's basically the same amount of pressure you put on yourself to try and get the best result out of it. So, nothing really changes actually from that side. I think we always had quite high level performance as a team, but we just didn't have that good of a car, I think, up until this year. Of course, you know, last year already the car was very good. But the years before we were close, winning here and there and not fighting for the Constructors’, but yeah, I think everything really came together. We understood this new regulation really well. And yeah, when you have the good people also in every single position and you can achieve something like you're witnessing right now. You're already talking a little bit: just hydrate well, not dehydrate, but hydrate well. What is the best thing about racing in the humidity?  Well, you just lose weight.  Well, then the negative of course is that it's just quite uncomfortable driving, like you always feel just very warm and you have to get used to just sweating and it can't really go anywhere, it's just in your suit, and so you have to just get comfortable with that. Yeah, it's a tough track. You need to keep focused throughout the whole race. It's easy to hit a wall here and there. But that's always tough on the street circuits, but then of course with increased heat, just trying to stay focused for almost two hours  or two hours is the hardest bit, I guess. Yeah, I wouldn't go against my technical director! No, I agree. It's not one area, I think, it's just very good in basically all the areas. I think I've said this before; when people ask you what is your driving style, of course, maybe naturally you have a driving style, like what you like more than others, but it's also about adapting. If you keep forcing your way of driving in a car which doesn't like that it's not going to work so you have to adapt. And adaptability, I think, is key in Formula 1 all the time, every single race weekend, every single session can be different and that's what I try to do. Well, I'm not disappointed in that. But they had a pretty shit race, so probably he was still pissed off with their performance. He almost sounds like he’s an employee of our team sometimes. But no, luckily not. I think it's just important that you focus on your own team. That's what we do as well. That's what we did in the past as well, when we were behind them and when they were dominating, and I think you should be able to appreciate when a team is doing really well, which I think we've done in the past because it worked also as a kind of inspiration. You know to see someone that dominant, it was very impressive at the time and we knew that we just had to work harder, try to be better and try to get to that level. And now that we are there, we are very happy of course that we are there and we are enjoying the moment and honestly, that's all I can say about it. I think every single one is a bit different. But I think also at the time, he was probably in the middle of that streak. I had the streak so now.. Yeah, they’re completely different cars, different times so you can't compare. But yeah, of course naturally I want to try and continue that streak but I know that there will be a day of course that it will stop. Normally, street circuit, Singapore is always a bit more of a risk, a bit more chaos. But we are here to win and we'll try to do that. I don't think it will. We never really had any flexible front wing or whatever. So I don't think it will hurt us.",Singapore,thursday,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"A lot of things, I guess. Need to see the chequered flag first, it's a very demanding race. Everything runs a little bit hotter than normal. The walls are very close, as all the street circuits. And you need to have that confidence in the car that you need to have as well in Monaco and Baku. So, let's see if we can build that confidence from the free practice and get a good race. I hope so. I think it's difficult to say. In Monza we were not competitive, that's for sure. Here we hope to be a little bit in better shape, but I think it's very tight. And some of the street circuits we had kind of feeling, like Monaco, that we were okay. In Baku, we were not okay. So, I think we have to wait and see. And as I said, build from FP1 a momentum. Let's see. I think it's going to be long until Abu Dhabi, I think it's going to be up and down for everybody. We saw during the season some moments on some races it seems that we were the second fastest. Some of the races, we feel that we are the fifth or the sixth fastest. So this, as I said, is difficult to guess. But you know, we are confident. Obviously we are in a position that is a privilege to have, fighting with top teams, and we're still enjoying every moment in every weekend. But yeah, let's see. I think we have to go race-by-race and be very open with our chances, and if we can score many points, we will fight for second. I don’t know. I was not in the in the interview or in the conversation. So sometimes we will read the headline and you don't know exactly what it comes from and, and what is the tone of the answer. So, it's up to him obviously, if he thinks about it. As I said, I think when Daniel came back, it is a challenge. It cannot be underestimated, going back to F1. And yeah, it could be a challenge. Same. Well, let's see. I think that's raced kilometres. They never count free practice, qualifying or testing. So I remember the first year, testing in 2002 when I was test driver, I did 40,000 kilometres, only that season. So if you put all the numbers together, they are a lot of laps but yeah, hopefully we’ll see the chequered flag on Sunday,  normally gives you some points here because anything can happen and yeah, let's see the next few years, how many more laps. I don’t know. In racing cars, for sure. Because yeah, I've been testing and doing a lot of laps every week,  off-road as well. Well, there are eight thousand in Dakar, plus 10,000 of testing or something so there is a lot of kilometres always.",Singapore,thursday,Aston Martin
Carlos Sainz,"I'm not sure I've definitely felt good the last few races in the car. Yeah, we are starting to understand it a lot better and making sure that we put the car in the right place in FP1 and it gives you confidence and it's an easier build up. But yeah, this year I feel like I understand the car a lot better and I'm driving better than last year.  It's just maybe the last two, three weekends I’ve managed to put everything together a bit more and it shows in the results. But the driving and the comfort in the car is good and now, hopefully in the second half of the season, my target was to be more consistent and just nail more results, nail more weekends, we can keep doing that like we did in Zandvoort and Monza. Yes, we are realistic and theory says that we should not be as quick as Monza. Normally, up until now, all the high downforce races we've struggled a bit more than the low downforce ones and this is a very (inaudible) long, not long combined corners, they are more sharp apices where our car tends to suffer a bit less. But at the same time, it will be hot, it will be tough on tyres, which we also know can be tricky for us, so let's see. Like Fernando said, this year is going to be changing a lot race to race and we need to stay open minded. We did actually learn some very interesting stuff about how our car performs in that sort of track and what our high downforce wings are doing and yet in some other cases they don't work as well as we like and that's why we're changing a lot the package race-to-race, and hopefully for this weekend we found a better solution than in Zandvoort and it can give us a bit more performance. But honestly, I think it's a much bigger thing than just the rear wing and it's more a car characteristic thing. Just wish for a couple of safety cars to break up the rhythm, to get a bit of a… open the vizor for a bit when you're feeling really warm. And enjoy the tea that we have in the car because that's not a drink, I think it's more a tea that we have to drink during the race to rehydrate because it doesn't taste good at all. It's not what you want to have when you're struggling in the heat. It’s a difficult question. Smart kid. So how do you reset? Well, if it's a red flag you do have time to cool down,  chat with your engineers and maybe plan a bit around that second part of the race that is about to happen.  It’s like a full reset. And you think about strategy and how you're going to do the restart. Normally there's some weather condition that has changed or whatever. If not and it's just the safety car, under a safety car you keep focused, you don't really fully disconnect and you're constantly thinking about keeping the tyres and the brakes up to temperature. And probably you're deciding how you're going to do the restart, where you're going to attack if you're going to attack. What's your difference in relative performance to the others, like, for example, I am on a softer tyre than the guy in front or are they on a harder tyre so are they going to struggle in the restart or not? So you start planning a bit your restart and how you're going to attack it and you just don't fully disconnect on a safety car, while maybe on a red flag, you do get some time to cool down.
MV: He nailed it, yeah. I think now I feel more at one with the car since the beginning of the season, really. It's not like something's changed recently.  It’s just maybe just putting the weekend together has been a bit more the case but I feel at one with the car from the beginning of the season while last year that wasn't the case and I had to change quite a bit of things with my driving and adapting and tuning a bit the car to my liking.  But in terms of who we will be racing this weekend?  I have no idea. I think it could well be Aston, it could well be Mercedes, could well be McLaren or even Alpine if they are as competitive as in Zandvoort. I think Red Bull will be one step ahead but if we nail everything then anything can happen.",Singapore,thursday,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, my feeling can only be amazing with the tifosi of course. On my side, I'm a bit disappointed. I obviously wanted to be first but seeing that Carlos is P1 is great for Ferrari. He has done an incredible job all weekend. I've been struggling quite a bit more, FP1, FP2, FP3 but in Qualifying I managed to put everything together, so I was really happy. Then unfortunately in Q3 I didn't have a slipstream and probably this cost us one position at least, but it's life, we should be happy. Especially on my side, I've been struggling a lot… They [the tifosi] are just incredible. I don't smile very often when I'm P3 but obviously being here and having that much support is an amazing feeling. Exactly. And we'll try to do first and second with Carlos. Well, our Q3 was really on the limit. I mean, the two laps I've done, I was really happy with my laps. But we were very close with Max and Carlos. To be honest, it's not something that I expected. Until now it's been such a difficult weekend for me. Yesterday, I went into a direction that was completely wrong with the car set-up and I really struggled to put a lap together. This morning in FP3 was all about adapting to that new car, following the direction of Carlos’ set-up. And then in Quali, I managed to put everything together and I'm really happy with the performance we've shown today. Yes, it's only P3 and I’m never completely happy with third place but considering where we started the weekend, it's not a bad place to be. I had a feeling that this was the right direction to go. But obviously after FP2, I realised that it wasn't. It’s as simple as that. And yeah, then it was all about re-adapting to everything in FP3 as quickly as possible, but also there I have been quite inconsistent. And then, coming into Qualifying, I put everything together. And the last lap in Q3 was really good. I mean, Carlos has done an incredible job since FP1, he's been on it, and in Q3 as well, his lap was really, really good. But yeah, happier to be that close. Well, I think it wasn't too bad. Compared to the others, I feel we probably struggled a bit more on the Hard, especially on the first lap, straight out the box. We seem to struggle a bit more to put them into temperature but, apart from that, it was good on all three compounds. I'm not a big fan of it. Q1 Q2, Q3 is okay but free practice is not great. I don't like it. Unfair or fair, at the end we are Ferrari so of course there's a lot of noise around the team and we need to deal with it. None of us are happy in the team of the performance we are showing at the moment, apart from today, of course, where we are quite proud and happy. But the rest of the season for now has been very difficult. And we are also aware so it's normal that people are talking a lot about Ferrari, because Ferrari is Ferrari and because of all the history they have in the sport and now it's our duty to make everything in order to come back at the top. Then for the pressure;  me personally I don't feel more pressure coming here. It's just motivation. It's a long week for us;  obviously we start already from Monday or Tuesday at the simulator and then we've got events in Milan and we feel so much support. You can really feel how much it means to the whole country, this Grand Prix, and how much Ferrari means to them. So it is very special. You can feel the responsibility, but at the end it's a lot more motivation than pressure.",Italy,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, of course, but it's nice to see, and of course tomorrow we'll try to win the race. Normally we have a quick race car but first, you know, just enjoy today and then I will focus on tomorrow. So now you do count my Spa pole! OK [laughs]. Yeah, I think it was just very tight. You know, you could see Q1, Q2, Q3. Yeah, it was… every run, you could see that we were very closely matched. And I think this weekend, especially from my side, I think Friday was a little bit more tricky, but I think we can't really complain. So many weekends in a row where we put the car on the track and it has been easy going, it has been really well set-up and it seemed like here it was just a little more difficult to find the right trade-off of downforce for us. But I was very happy this morning. I thought the car’s working well on one lap and on the long run as well. So, yeah, I'm happy with second, to be honest. Here in Monza it’s always very tight. Sometimes you might jump ahead, sometimes you're just behind but I'm confident for tomorrow. It was good. Just pushing as hard as I could. On a track like this, with low downforce, it's not always the easiest, but it was enjoyable out there. I mean, so far this year, yes. So hopefully it will be the same tomorrow. Not really surprised, they were quick also last year. Also when you look at their rear wing, it seems like it's quite well optimised for Monza where I think our wing especially for one lap is maybe not the best optimization but for the race normally it should be better. So yeah, nothing shocking to be honest. For me, it's not necessary.  It doesn't really change anything.  The quickest cars anyway at the front and normally also the quickest cars on the harder compounds are even better so it probably makes it even worse for the teams in the back. Oh no, I don't think like that. I'm only here to win and then we'll figure out what happens leaving the track but the fans, they of course support Ferrari and of course they will always want to see a red car win but they are also sensible, you know, they're not hooligans, so it's all okay. Yeah, or just barge through it, have to run out of the way so it will be okay -  no, I'm joking. It will be fine.",Italy,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Honestly, it's been such an intense Qualifying especially in Q3, you know. All three of us went for it, we were very, very on the limit. And in that last lap, I knew I had some lap time to come in Ascari and Parabolica and I went for it. And it worked well. Why not, because I really pushed hard, you know, on that last lap. Goosebumps since I crossed the finish line. The whole in-lap, watching the crowd and obviously getting out of the car and seeing this, I haven't stopped the goosebumps. It's incredible. But in the hotel, arriving to the track. Everywhere we go, it's just noise, support and encouragement and it’s the best feeling you can have as a driver, as an athlete. Yeah, that's the number one target. Tomorrow I'm going to give it everything to hold on to that P1. A good start, a good first stint, see if we can battle Max. Normally in the long runs, he's quicker but I'm going to give it all. It’s difficult to put into words, to describe the feeling. It's just amazing, you know. Just the whole weekend really, since we arrived here on Wednesday, the support and the feeling with the crowd and the energy that they put into us, it's incredible. I had my birthday yesterday also, so I enjoyed that and I'm pretty sure it gave me also a good feeling, good vibes and good energy into today. I've been feeling very comfortable with the car and I put together, honestly, one of my best laps there in Q3, run two, to settle pole. It was tight with these two, like it used to be last year, and like it gets to be normally and I enjoyed a lot that lap. Well, I guess our efficiency. Like we've seen in some tracks this year, it's pretty good and the car, honestly, since we put it on track on FP1, it just felt completely different to what it did in Zandvoort and it is what it is. It's what we're getting this year: we're getting some very good weekends and some other very tough ones, we just need to make sure on the good ones we, we try to maximise, like we did today, and in the tough ones, we learn how to suffer and get the best out of it. But honestly, the car today, I cannot fault it. It was a really, really good balance. It gave me a lot of confidence through Sector 2, Ascari and Parabolica, and it’s there I think where I could make the major difference when it counted, taking a bit more risks. Yeah, I'm not very worried about that, because I had to slow down so much to not impede other cars that were on fastest laps that it was almost impossible to respect the delta that the Race Director put us, because if I would have respected it, I would have impeded my competitors. So I just played it safe, preferred to not impede anyone. And even if I was, I think, one or two seconds off the Delta, I think that's safer than actually impeding someone. Yeah, thank you. Don’t scare me! Well, we've got the motivation and the energy to do it. The car, it has been very good all weekend, especially over one lap. From what I've seen through the long runs, I'm not going to lie, it's trickier. It's not the same picture as in Quali. That Red Bull, as soon as you put five or six laps on the tyre, and everything starts to degrade a bit, it's where they come, their strengths, and the race pace that we've seen all year. But hopefully I can get a good start and then I can make Max and Checo behind and Charles’ life, obviously, as difficult as possible. But I think we will need to work well as a team and give it our best shot. I think it's a good opportunity tomorrow, but also being realistic, the Red Bull should be quicker. We're just going to try and make their life as complicated as possible and try to take the win. I think it can happen. I think nothing is impossible tomorrow, especially starting from P1. If I get a good start, I'm going to do everything I can to stay ahead of Max.  I think, looking back at this year, one hundred per cent of races, they've been quicker and they've been clearly quicker no? So that makes me feel like it's not going to be easy at all and they're going to try a way past one way or another, no? But, you know, something could happen. We could also have a particularly good day tomorrow and get the win. So I'm just going to try, and go open-minded into tomorrow, drive us as I want to win the race and then adapt to the circumstances and to the race pace of each car. Maybe you should ask Max? But honestly, I don't believe in statistics too much. And these kind of how – do you call them, curses or whatever? I think on Sunday wins the one who deserves the most and normally the one who is quicker – unless something happens. And I'm just going to try to be that one. The faster one and the one that puts everything together and go into tomorrow also trying to enjoy the day, y’know? Enjoy starting on pole in Monza with Ferrari. Good energy, good vibes. And then yeah, just enjoy myself out there, because it's going to be fun. Yeah, I think it's typical here in Monza. You have such a light feeling with a car that you never really are willing in practice to take the car to the absolute limit until really Q3 when it counts, and I've had a few good laps here in the past in Q3. I remember my McLaren days and even last year in Ferrari also, I had a really good run around Ascari and Parabolica when you go and remove – a bit – that fear and you're going to take the ultimate risk and today work again. You just go into that corner that is an incredibly fast corner, where the car feels incredibly light and you just hope it grips – and it did. Like it's been doing all weekend. This car has been giving me that extra confidence and extra feeling to push through there. And I think I had a very good run through there and I could take pole by hundredths. But yeah, it was good fun. Honestly this Qualifying session, I enjoyed it a lot. I enjoyed the battle already from Q3 Run One, where we did point-five, all three of us. I knew it was going to be super, super tight and all about the details and risks going into the second run and it was really good fun. Honestly, this year, yeah, it's been an up-and-down year in terms of pace. And some races we are there, some others were not. But I've been feeling a lot more at home with the car since the beginning of the season and I feel like I understand a lot better how to drive it, and how to set it up a bit more to where I want the car to be. And yeah, I've been having a – in terms of pace and getting pace out of the car – a smoother season. And I am hoping that this second half I just can put more weekends together like I did in Zandvoort and it becomes a bit smoother from here onwards and we just maximise where we are. I think the FP1 and FP2 and FP3 are maybe a bit more of a pain with the tyre allocation, just not being able to put as many new tyres and learn from the car and maybe waiting around in the garage for a bit longer than… Honestly in qualifying, I like it. I like hard, medium soft; having to adapt, having to find the grip. It becomes a bit more improvisation and a bit more like yeah, improvisation and feeling of how much grip you're going to find in Q2 and Q3. But the rest of the weekend I wish we could have a bit more running and a bit more tyres;  just Q1,  Q2, Q3,  I like it. I don't… I tell to myself ‘Vamos, Carlos’. I don't know. Have you ever been that person to realise what you're thinking.  I think we're going so fast and we're so pumped of adrenaline that you don't really have time to tell yourself much. You're just seeing turn one come at 340 kph and with these cars that jumped around you cannot even see turn one because of the vibrations and the speed that we're doing. So you're just trying to find your braking point as much as you can and even sometimes it's quite difficult to find it. So I don't have time to tell myself ‘vamos’ or anything like that. I'm looking from the beginning of the straight, seeing where's my braking point is, because I need to find it. Yeah, I would agree with Charles. I wouldn't call it pressure, I would call it a sense of responsibility and a sense of wanting to give this crowd and this country the best possible version of yourself, both off  the track and on the track with your performance. Honestly I cannot be enjoying this weekend more than I've been enjoying it from the beginning and it's been like that for the last three years, since I'm a Ferrari driver.  I just cannot remember or cannot think about a better feeling than being a Ferrari driver in Monza. And it's a dream come true, something that I'm sure I will remember for the rest of my life, to be going through these years of experience, feeling this, something that I consider myself extremely lucky to do. And yeah, it's responsibility more than pressure. And the other question was: vamos?  Pressure? No, that was the one I answered. No, there was another question. Yeah, okay. Good. Probably my three pole positions - you count four because of Max last year in Spa but I think three proper pole positions you know -  I'm fair, not the statistics, must be very, very good laps and my best laps but I've always done good laps around Monza. Sometimes I've had the car for pole, other times  no. This one is for sure up there. I am not sure if it's the best one.  I've done so many Qualifyings in F1: 150+, 180 Qualifyings, so to pick this one… for sure it’s the most special position. Is it my best lap ever around the circuit? I'm not sure, I cannot remember but definitely one that I've enjoyed the most. You can also go in a helicopter if not.",Italy,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"Quite different. We are lucky enough that driving for Ferrari we’ve got support everywhere but when we come to Italy, obviously it’s on a different level. So a very busy week, but also a very exciting one. I’m sure it motivates the whole team. So we are really looking to go out on track and hopefully have a great result this weekend. I love it. Especially the Ferrari old-style logo here is what I love most. Also on the cap here, you can see it. So, beautiful. I love it. Many. Not really in the race, as obviously a part of my front wing went under the floor and broke everything, so I had basically very little grip but for the rest of the weekend, we tried quite a few things. Especially in FP1, trying to put the car in very different places, in terms of set-up, to see how it will react. I think we had some confirmation of what we expected, so we’ve got a lot of work to do now and find solutions to our problems and the weakness of the car – but it’s even clearer, compared to before, where we are lacking at the moment. Yes. The unpredictability, especially on tracks where we have a bit more downforce. It becomes really, extremely tricky to drive, and we’ve got big changes of balance through the same corner and, as a driver, it’s very difficult to get into a corner not really knowing what balance you are going to get. So, that’s where we need to work at the moment. Let’s say it’s… well, it’s not exactly like Spa but these track characteristics are closer to the ones of Spa than Zandvoort and Budapest, so we should be a bit more competitive here. Then, whether it will be enough to fight for the podium, I don’t know but I really hope so and we will do everything for it, for sure. Yeah, I mean, on my side, we are in quite a difficult situation at the moment and the priority is to first focus on the job we've got to do with the car, because we are quite far off the Red Bull. But then I'm sure that at the end of the season we'll start the talks. I think I've made clear quite a few times what are my intentions for the future. My dream has always been of being a Ferrari driver. And I would love to be winning a World Championship with them. And yeah, I'm not too worried about when the discussions will start. I've still got a year and a half of contract for now. So I'm not in a rush. Well, I think first of all, my call came really late, much later than the one of Checo. I was fighting with Oscar and I think I did the call in the last corner, which is very late. But I also knew that with the amount of rain there was in the last corner, whatever I will lose inside the pits, whether it was five or 10 seconds, I will recover them on the out lap, because there was way too much rain for slicks, which we did. So at the end, it was the right choice. Then we could have optimised few things. But yeah, we’ll keep that inside the team. But, yeah, for sure, there were things that we call have done a little bit better. It wouldn't have made a huge difference, because again, the main thing that made us lose time is just a call that arrived late, but that was the right choice anyway. No. For me, I really don't mind. I don't know. I've never been sensitive to that. Even the porpoising wasn’t something that was really disturbing me. I don't know why. But yeah, for me, it's for me, it's fine.",Italy,thursday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"There’s not  a lot to say. They didn’t let me hold it for long, but it was a nice thing to have done. So yeah, it was good, some of the organisers were there and the people who put it all together again. It was nice to meet some of them and yeah, try to give something bac for what I did. My first partner was Alex. We dominated, we thought the teams were unfair, so then I had to go with Max, ‘cos he’s the newest member to the padel group, and we won again. So the common denominator was I won and George lost. But it was a lot of fun, we had a nice little day. We play every now and again. I played with George already last week and a few other times and it was nice for us all to play. We get quite emotional at times, and think a lot of people were complaining about how loud we were shouting and how angry we were getting – but it was a nice day and a nice way to start the weekend. Tough! Not as much as I would like. I think that’s obvious: I think we saw in Spa how much we struggled, even though Spa wasn’t where we could have been. I think if we could redo Spa now I think we would be in a better position, and since then we’ve spent quite a bit of time trying to optimize some of the downforce packages that we have for these kind of circuits: maybe not in as confident a position as we are in, say Zandvoort, Silverstone, Budapest and places like that, but definitely a better position than we were in Spa, and that’s definitely given me a bit more hope. We’ve had good races here in the past, it has been one of our best weekends in the last few years, so I’m hoping that will repeat again. It’s great. It’s always been a pleasure to race against him. Even this year we’ve had a few more battles and that’s a cool thing. To have raced against someone who’s one of the best drivers ever in Formula 1, who’s created a lot of history, written a lot of history. I think it’s a… I guess a pleasure for all of us, someone I looked up to when I was a little kid and still get the chance to race against him now. So, I’m happy and will continue to do so for a couple more years. Yeah, we just spoke about it a bit now. And, as always, there’s been a few days of reviewing things, and making sure we look at things first. I always say things that I never… when you look at it after you always think… I always make myself look like an idiot and you, know that I would never mean something like that, of course. So, it’s more that we made some mistakes with our calls and our strategy and things like that. A bit of it is just emotions at the time. I think I said it the other day, like I always sound like I’m crying or moaning on the radio. I don’t know why. I hate it but I feel like I’m really relaxed and chilled in the car but then I’m always the opposite when I listen to myself afterwards. So, yeah, there’s just always discussions, I guess, there’s always things that you’re trying to tell them and information that you’re trying to get. It’s just a couple of times when the information was not to the level it should have been – clearly. Then yeah, I guess it gets a little frustrating a couple of times. But stuff we’ve reviewed… it definitely won’t happen again. It’s definitely something I would be open to in the future. I think I can happily say Max is probably one of the best drivers ever in the history of Formula 1. I never raced against him until I was in Formula 1 but I was always in the category below. In karting I already knew him reasonably well. Back in 2012-2013 was the first time I got to meet him and get to know him, so I’ve been able to witness what he’s doing and I think it’s not just that he’s in a good car and he’s able to perform. I think no matter what car he’s in, he’ll be able to perform at a similar level. Maybe with different results but at a similar level and I think at that point it’d be great to work alongside someone like that and, at the same time, see where I can really stand against him. I’d be open to it. I invited him to McLaren the other day. So, if he wants to come any time, he’s very welcome. No, my team knows. People always judge things from the outside and like to make comments but the team know how I work and how we say things and so forth. I’m not denying… I think at that time I was a bit frustrated with what I was getting told and things like that. I’m not denying at times, and also in the past, when you’re under pressure it gets a bit stressful at times, then I maybe don’t sound the most relaxed. But a lot of the time I am, and it maybe doesn’t come across that way, especially if you’re on the outside, listening to things. The team know how I work, and when I’m performing well, and when I’m not and they know how I work. Simple as that. As long as they know that, and I know how they do things and how they speak to me and how we interpret things, that’s all that’s, from my side, what’s needed. From what people see from the outside, I care, but in a way, I don’t care, because I’m doing my job and I just do that the best I can. I mean, I would love it. I wouldn't say no, if we could have softer cars or something that makes it a bit more like it was in ’19, ’20, ‘21. I’ve struggled a lot with my back. I've had to make quite a few seats and do a lot more training just to try and strengthen my back, my lower back. I've had a lot of issues over the last 12 months or so. Similar to Carlos. It’s probably mainly referring to me, I think, when he said it. Yeah, I guess everyone's had different things and struggles with different bits and cars are different and whatever. But yeah, for different reasons, but a bit of it including the car and how stiff it is. I've struggled quite a bit.",Italy,thursday,McLaren
Valtteri Bottas,"Actually, not really. He really seems to enjoy racing still. He’s still go the fire to get back up there again, so not really surprised. yeah! I had a pretty easy day – maybe I’m getting old! – but pretty chilled, which was nice after a hectic race on Sunday. So, yeah, had a good day, thank you. Yeah, it’s a very Italian design. I think it looks good and obviously it’s the final home race together for Sauber and Alfa Romeo, so it’s a big weekend for us, and that’s why I hope we can also be competitive. A good welcome. Lot of passion around here, lot of energy. We have a big support group over here and also from the factory, some people have the chance to come here this weekend and see the cars in action. So, it’s not going to be down to lack of support. We’ve got some new stuff for front suspension. Otherwise it’s a low downforce package. Always difficult to predict , it’s super-close. It’s a fast lap so margins will be small – but yeah, we really need some points now. We haven’t scored for a while. I think he’s made progress from last year. He’s made a big step in performance but also confidence and technical knowledge and I think he really deserves a place in Formula 1. And he’s a nice guy as well. Really good guy to work with. It’s true. I'm involved in quite a bit. But all that I am involved in is what I have a passion [for], like, for me nice they are things to do and to be involved [in]. And with many things I do have people helping me, so I can really choose the load I take from those activities, and especially on race weekends I also always try to minimise things that I don't want to do, and I can basically choose, so I think, for me, it's a great balance. I think it's nice to have other things than Formula 1, just to keep things mentally fresh so that every time I come to a race weekend, I really want to be here and I really want to perform the best I can. So for me it's a good balance at the moment. Not so much to add. My back was already destroyed in 2015, so there's no feeling anymore, so it doesn't matter! But in the end, everyone will always search for performance versus comfort. You take it, even with not being so comfortable in the car. And that would be definitely by the regulations somehow to be improved, not by the teams, because teams wouldn't go softer if it's slower.",Italy,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Nico Hülkenberg,"A little bit perhaps – but I feel the tifosi, they obviously love Ferrari the most but they’re just very passionate about F1 and cheer for most teams and most drivers I feel, just a lot of love and support. So yeah, always great to feel that here. A quick car! Be fast on the straights, be good in braking too. Obviously it’s a low downforce package, which has been difficult for us this year. I think we haven’t been too competitive when it’s been low downforce so, frankly, expectations are not too high. We’ve just got to keep working, like everyone. Everyone is pushing forwards. In Zandvoort, we raced a new front wing for the first time. I think it’s definitely a step forwards. I think it wasn’t really visible or didn’t come out because of the circumstances of the race. But some progress made – but we need further improvements to be competitive – or to be more competitive within the midfield. It’s different but it was challenging and tough back then, but it’s the same right now. I feel… it’s difficult. I don’t know, there are quick cars now, especially the race pace, when we don’t have a lot of tyre deg, the pace can be very high compared to five, six years ago. But going back at the very beginning of my career, you know, it was similar too. Cars had less downforce but they were lighter so it’s comparable. It’s always challenging and tough – we’re in Formula 1 and everyone’s pushing. The cars are definitely super, super stiff, the stiffest I've ever driven and witnessed in my time in F1. So it's definitely, I think, something… Most drivers feel it's something we would like to work on. It also limits you sometimes in races when you want to offset yourself, getting out of dirty air, you can't use many kerbs because of stiffness. So it just limits what you can on lines, racing lines, etc. So, it is tricky. There is some, you know, some difficulties with that for sure. Pain, I don't have [any] but you know, obviously that's very different, everybody's built different, everybody has a different seating position. But yeah, they are very, very stiff.",Italy,thursday,Haas
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I think this track offers you this opportunity. Very fast, one of the fastest straight line speeds ever, and then braking for Turn One, it’s always quite challenging, for example, because of how light your car is. So it’s not always a straightforward thing. And especially in the race. Back then, when we used to have earlier and more degradation, the racing was a little more unpredictable in that regard. It’s always good racing around here in Monza. I think it’s very hard to predict. In some races, we felt like we’re going to have quite a bit of margin and then it turns out to be really close. And in some others we really don’t think it’s going to be that far off. It’s quite difficult to predict and I think this is a very different circuit to anything we’ve done before, so it will be very interesting. Yeah, a lot. I really, really want to have a straightforward weekend and I think with this new tyre rule for Qualifying, it’s also quite challenging as we saw in Hungary. Having a strong Qualifying, it’s key around this place, so hopefully we can come away with a result. Well, I think we have to appreciate what Max is doing. At the level that he is driving at the moment, it’s extreme. I think the ability he has to perform at his 100 per cent every single weekend, no matter which conditions he’s driving at. It’s something that… yeah… it’s quite hard to see as his team-mate, y’know? It doesn’t really matter what’s happened, whether we have a good margin or bad margins or the car is becoming difficult. He’s been able to extract 100 per cent, out of him, out of the car, pretty much every weekend. Yeah, it’s certainly something to do with his balance, to do with how he’s driving the car and looking after the tyres. Something that he found, and he’s been operating in that balance-wise, and he was able to cope with it already in Baku. From my side there is still a year and a half to go. So I think there's no need to change anything. It's more important now to focus on the races ahead and finish the season on a high. And then we will start discussing early next year what's the plan to go forwards? I think every driver through their career or through each season, you know, you get some upgrades to the car that adapt easier to your driving style than others, you know, like, sometimes you will put a part in it and you will straight away go faster with it. Sometimes you will have to adapt to it. And it's something that we are all facing through our times during the season with the upgrades. And I haven't been able to adapt as quickly as I should, you know, and I had to change my driving style a bit to adapt into the car more than in the beginning of the season, for example, when things were coming more naturally. But that's something that most drivers at some point we go through. I think it's hard to say, you know, I think we have to look at it race by race at the end of the day. Sometimes the gap is bigger. For example, how it was in Zandvoort, it was mainly getting the conditions right and exploiting everything out of the car, and the differences, if you don't get the conditions right, you will see a big delta. It's how it works sometimes. We've seen with other drivers those sorts of gaps. It's a long season in F1 and it doesn't really matter, in my opinion, where we are now, it only matters where we are able to finish and then we can summarise our season in Abu Dhabi. Definitely I went through a bit of a tough patch through the middle of the season where I was struggling the most with the car. But I think that's all behind us and we should be having good races from now on. For me, also fine. I haven't had any issues with my back. My back is as fresh as when I was 15. So I'm lucky in that regard, I guess. Certainly the cars are on the stiff side, but I haven't had any problems.",Italy,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, you're all stuck with me for a little bit longer! Honestly, I couldn't be happier to be extending with this team. We've had such an incredible journey together. I mean, Mercedes have supported me since I was 13. So such a long trip. And we still have unfinished business. So, we are in this together, we've got a lot of work to do to get ourselves back to the front, but there's no place I'd rather be. No, no, I definitely wanted to continue. I mean, I think in life, there's always… When you have up and downs, like last year was a difficult year, I'm pretty sure everyone was questioning whether they wanted to continue, because it's just tough at the top. And it's such a tough sport. But that feeling, that thought, quickly goes away and you put your work, you put your mind and your energy into being the best you can be and dealing with the situations that you're faced with. And so I'm really proud of what we achieved last year to get through it. And then while we started on the wrong foot this year to have had some really great results, we're second in the Constructors' Championship, and the plan is to keep that and then close the gap to the guy ahead. The goal is simple, yep. Setting the target is simple. Achieving that target is not. But it's going to take all of us pulling together… I think every team here and every driver is working so hard to get on top of the aero package they have and the team that they have and pull everyone together. And having everyone firing on all cylinders is not easy in a large team. And so that takes consistent work. And same from a driver's perspective, you know, just making sure you're performing every weekend. Even though I've been driving and racing all these years, I still feel like I can improve each weekend. And I think that's what I love about this sport – you're never going to reach perfection, but the pursuit of perfection is one of the most exciting things about what we do. It's shifted a lot. I think from the beginning, it was, I mean… I can't remember if it was here… No it was somewhere else that I got black cats thrown at me. But I think here was, yeah, I remember there was a period of time where we couldn't wear the team shirt into the circuit, to now just having such a warm welcome from the Italian fans. And finally, for the last, God knows how many years, just feeling really welcome here. And in a place that I've loved since I was like 13, the first time I started racing in Italy, in Parma and Jesolo and South Garda. And it brought me so much happiness. I had so many great memories out here, eating as many pizzas as possible, the great pasta and the best lasagna ever. And the gelato. So to finally be embraced within the culture, and especially with this incredible crowd that we get here. You know, obviously, a large percent are Ferrari fans, but the passion that the Italian fans have is second to none. So I think we got a cool little following here. And I look forward to seeing them this weekend. Well, we’re trying to win more World Championships and I think, yep, the unfinished business is getting us to the back to the top, it’s getting back and fighting for World Championships. We've been the most successful team in history and had the most successful run in the past 10 years or whatever but it's been a challenge this past year so I think yeah, it’s just getting us back to where we belong and where we operate on all those cylinders which you're seeing Red Bull do. I can’t remember what the last part was. It's what you see. It's not necessarily what someone says, it's the work that you're doing, it's the meetings we've been having with all the engineers, with James Allison and the whole group back at the factory just focused on… the heads of all the departments coming together and talking and just really engaging better than ever before about where we are, the mistakes we've made, why we've made those decisions and why we won't make them again and where we're going. And just all having that confidence in each other that we are the best at what we do and when we come together and when we… given time, we will get to where we need to be. Well, firstly, behind this camera we have a couple of kids who wanted to say… and some parents who wanted to say hi. I don't know if they can see us. Hi guys. Ah, shoot. What did you say? Yeah, definitely. I definitely didn't think that I would be at the age that I am and feel the way that I do, physically and mentally and still love what I'm doing as much as I do. And that's something I'm incredibly grateful for. I think a lot of people stay in the same jobs and roles for a long period of time and fall out of love with it but just keep going because it's maybe the only thing they can do, but for me, I genuinely love, I still have that love for what I'm doing. I still love getting in the car. I still love racing with my peers and I still love working alongside Bono and all the guys in the garage, in the team, like chasing that common goal and dream. And I love that feeling of when you have the lows together and when you have the highs together, there's nothing like it. Yeah. Bono’s stuck. Yeah, I'm very fortunate and again, that's like history as well. There's no… I don't think there's ever been an engineer and driver pairing that's been this long. So we’re setting new records. I think I look at people like Tom Brady, who's such an incredible athlete and has shown what can be done today, so he's the real role model, in that respect, I think for all athletes to be able to look at, and I'm really, really fortunate that I've been able to speak to him to understand, as well, what he's done, what he does consistently to keep himself in shape and he's expressed it in the media anyways. And then, yeah, of course it's great seeing Fernando. He was here way before I was and obviously took that retirement and came back and is doing an amazing job. It just shows that your talent never really leaves you. As long as you have that passion and that commitment you can continue. And then on the 2021 thing, I'm not really a revenge person. It's not about revenge. It's not about redemption. That's in the past. There's nothing you can do about the past but what we can do is work harder and be more precise and be better moving forwards. And I truly believe that with this team, we can win more World Championships and watch races together so that's where all my energy is going. I don't know what's been proposed. I've not heard anything. But we've experienced lots of changes, which were put in place to slow us down over the years and I think that it was better for the sport. If you look at 2021, for example, our qualifying pace was amazing… I think it's 2021 or 2020, I can't remember, but where they took away our qualifying mode, for example, brought us closer in qualifying. And on one side, the engineers just did an incredible job and they deserved that in merit but I think from a racing fan, we want to see all of us a lot closer. I think that what you're seeing behind the Red Bulls, we've seen quite a good championship this year, between the Ferraris, Astons and all the teams are looking a lot closer than ever before. So in some ways, the rule change has worked. In others, there's still some work that needs to be done. If you look at some of the teams, they're all capped but some teams don't have the same resources in terms of whether it's wind tunnel, whether it's stuff that's at the factory that the bigger teams had because they had loads of money to throw at it a long, long time ago and they can't catch up now. So there's always work to do but I think the sport’s done a great job and I do hope for the fans in future we don't see Mercedes dominate for 10 years or Ferrari dominate for 10 years or any other team because I think that's not in the best interest of what us drivers want or what the fans want or what the team want. We want close competition and I hope that gets better and better. Contract-wise, we got it done this week. Actually, the stuff was finished last week, last weekend. I'm not working towards next year thinking that it's going to take another four years to get to where we need to be, but I'm aware that it does take time. Of course, in my heart, I'm so hopeful that the decisions we are taking and the direction that we're rolling towards is that which will put us in in that target zone, to be able to fight the Bulls and be close and be challenging for pole. But if it's not next year, we'll continue to work through it. But in my heart, I truly believe that if it’s not next year, it's the year after we will be there. Look, there’s a bunch of other drivers here. Well, you should just tell us if you don't have any questions for these guys, because it sucks them having to sit here, but you should ask them these guys a question. I love James. Well, James is exceptional and we had an amazing journey together, we achieve so much together. And we still have a very good friendship. And I remember getting the message from… I remember him being in the role and realising there was nowhere for him to really progress within the system. And I knew that just it was a matter of time that he would break away and this opportunity came up, it was so great and so right for him. And obviously, so many people questioned whether he could do it and you're seeing such a great impact that he's having there. He's got such a great mindset. For us, it's not that… of course we miss people that we lose but we're very proud of people coming through, having a good time and having that success and carrying that on in their careers. And I think James was very much a part of setting up what the system we have within our team. So we're operating off some of his philosophy and we'll continue to do so. But I really, really hope that… and I'm excited to see the progress that they're making there and I can't wait to see Williams come further up. When you guys were up and in the top three last week, it was kind of cool, because when we were growing up Williams were right up there, so really happy for them and look forward to racing them soon. How old are you?",Italy,thursday,Mercedes
Alex Albon,"I mean, I was staying in the same hotel this year, and they put me in the same hotel room. And I was just laying in bed and I thought to myself this is exactly what happened and I woke up… well, I didn't go to bed and I got this pain coming. I don't know if you know what it's supposed to feel like but it can feel like you're gassy. So you spend a lot of time like… I didn't know what was going on but I honestly felt like I had PTSD! I had to ask to change room. So yeah, it is interesting. Obviously, it was a strange time. A frustrating time, actually, because it was the one time where last year I felt the car was quick enough to score points. But you know, Nyck did a great job, actually and he did the job for me. So yeah, thinking about it, obviously the appendix is out now so it shouldn't come up again. If it does, there's something wrong! Relative to last year, yes, I do think so. Well, we've just had a more competitive car at every track we've been to. But let's see. Obviously, coming from Zandvoort, especially, I think expectations are quite high from everyone for this weekend. But we have to be realistic. I think Spa was a bit of a wake-up call for us. We were not as quick as we thought we would be on a track that's quite similar to here. So let's not speak too much until FP1 and we can start to figure out where the car is and our pace. It doesn't feel the same if it's just a push along. But tell me! Yeah, no, genuinely? Yeah. OK. No, James is great. Obviously, he's come from Mercedes, he most probably was part of Lewis's contract back in the day, but he's come along, he's got a lot of experience coming from Mercedes. I've said it a few times now but I think honestly, the best of James is possibly still to come. I think that a lot of the stuff that we're doing right now is short term goals that we've been able to do obviously, things like tyres or whatever strategy he has prior knowledge, quick knowledge that you can get overnight, almost. But the real big things, the big ticket items are going to come next year, the year after that, and that's what I'm excited to see. I'm really excited to see what direction he's going to take the team. Speaking to him, he obviously has a close connection with drivers. And he does do a bit of driving himself so he gets this, he understands the language that we talk. We talk about it a lot at Williams, but we do have some characteristic problems in our car and hopefully if we can get them out of the way, I think we're going to make a good step. It shows at tracks like Zandvoort, when we don't have so many limited corners, we can be right up there. So let's see. Yeah, very similar comments. I think to be able to be in Formula 1 until you're 40 you… realistically you have to be a generational talent to be able to do it. I don't think… we would like to, all of us would like to be 40 and still be in Formula 1, but it doesn't normally turn out like that. That's our goal, I'm sure we all would love to keep doing what we're doing. I'm sure you guys know, being on the road for so long and doing it, it takes a toll on you, so I'm sure that there's a lot of fire in Lewis’s belly to be able to do that.",Italy,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"I think it's obviously very good for the whole morale of the team and obviously great to secure the second podium for the team this season. With such a tight midfield battle to have both of us on the podium this year, it's pretty cool. And it really shows that we can take the opportunity when it comes to us. And we should be pleased [about] that. Obviously, there's a lot of work ahead and we know, you know, how much we have to improve to be in positions to be more often in the top five and more often on the podium. There is still a lot of work ahead. So, yes, everyone is flat out pushing and the atmosphere is good inside the team. You know, I'm focused on my side of the job. As I said, an opportunity came, you know, and we took it as a team. You know, there are things that obviously we can always improve and get better at and everyone is focused on doing so. And, you know, my side of the job is to drive that car as fast as it can go and as high up as it can go in terms of results. So that's what I'm focused on. In Spa, we were pretty competitive, you know, in the dry. We had good pace, you know, from quite far [back] the grid and managed to have decent straight-line speed in Sector 1 and Sector 3. And that has helped us to be fast in the race. So, yeah, I hope that we can repeat something similar at this track and score some points on Sunday. Time flies, but luckily I'm still young. I'm not as young as I used to be compared to these two on my left… Twenty-six, almost 27. Thank you. It's been a while I've been around. Thank you. I look old, is that what you’re saying? You look good, man. Tell me your skincare routine. I don't know where I will be when I will be 40 but obviously, yeah, if I don't drive a car for a week, I feel like I miss something and I need to get that adrenaline back and to get that rush again. I'm just passionate. No, I'm just addicted to driving. That's who I will be for the rest of my life.",Italy,thursday,Alpine
Oscar Piastri,"I would say as a circuit it's probably not as technical as some others. But I think it has a very different atmosphere about it on from a Saturday to a Sunday. Obviously, you know, getting a slipstream in Qualifying is important. I've got nightmares of my F3 days of red flags in Qualifying sessions from people trying to get tows, so hopefully it's not that bad. But you know, obviously the slipstream plays a massive part and also on a Sunday. So yeah, maybe not the most technical of circuits, but an atmosphere I really enjoy and a track that is very good for overtaking and racing. So looking forward to it. I'll be able to tell you tomorrow. Yeah, I think we could have done a few things a little bit better. I think for myself, I didn't help my weekend with FP2. But we've reviewed the race and definitely a few calls that I think, given the opportunity again, we would have done a few different things. But yeah, to have both of us still in the points at the end of it, considering where we were at one point in the race I think was still a decent afternoon. Of course there was always more and I think some other teams and some other drivers show that if they made all the right decisions, there was a lot of points to play for. So some things to learn, definitely, from my personal development and I think also for the team too. Yeah, I've got 18 years until I get there. If I'm still driving race cars and loving what I'm doing at 40 years old, I think that's a pretty good 18 years of my life well spent. So yeah, when you've had the amount of success that Lewis has had, I can imagine why he loves it so much and I think we all start out racing because we love it. Of course, the higher up you get the more pressure there is, and other commitments and stuff like that, but I'd be quite happy if I’m racing at that age, I think.",Italy,thursday,McLaren
Yuki Tsunoda,"Especially after the Imola Grand Prix got cancelled, definitely all the Italians fans and our team were really disappointed but at the same time we know the reason and I think it's the first time this year Italian Grand Prix here I can see all people, mechanics, colleagues at AlphaTauri really motivated, also including me of course. And yeah, I hope I can have a good result here to kind of motivate and give extra energy to the people who works in Faenza as well. It's OK. I think in the end I just have to focus on what I have to do. The things I have to do is the same as usual: score points, have good results. Obviously, I would say more towards the team it doesn't help probably. It's not easy, like changing to another driver in one week, it's very difficult. But I think Liam is doing the job and also all the drivers doing a good job so far as well. Same for Daniel as well. Daniel started to get used to it more and he had a good session and then right after he got an unfortunate incident and Liam he just jumped into the FP3 and he did well in qualifying and the race. I think we’re all working well. It's not that easy but for myself not much difference. Yeah, well, nothing. Forty years old, yeah, still probably 17 years to go. Around there. It'll be nice. Obviously it will be nice, probably if being 40 years old, it will be nicer if I can be able to achieve my goal, like World Champion, but at the same time it will be nice, I want to do my own thing that I want to do outside of racing. Kind of own a restaurant would be nice.",Italy,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"All I want to say is, let's go! Yes! I’m feeling so stoked, honestly. What a race, coming back from the summer break and, you know, it hasn't been the easiest start of the year, just trying to improve race by race and it was good to get some time off, come back and straight into it. We had a third place in Spa in the Sprint, it wasn't exactly like a normal podium and I'm super pleased for all the guys to get that P3. Yeah, I was pretty upset that I got a five second penalty earlier in the race and I was like ‘OK, now it's 1-1’, and then, yeah, obviously I tried to push as hard as I could to stay within five seconds, and managed to do it. It was a very long race. Very challenging from start to finish and it was greatly executed from all the guys. Yeah. Yeah, it looks like that. Yeah, I mean, it was extremely tricky today, as Fernando and Max said. All the conditions were pretty much thrown at us from the start. We ended up on slicks in the dry, in damp conditions, then feeding the Inters on the wet, but then on a drying track. So it was all about adapting yourself to the conditions and really playing with the limits. But after the summer break, I was really excited to get back in the car and today was probably the most fun I've had all season. Very exciting to be fighting for these positions. And yeah, they were important goals to make but the whole team executed a very strong race. And I'm pleased, because we haven't been very fortunate since the start of the year, kind of involved in some unfortunate situations on many occasions, which goes to some points and which kind of built some frustration but you’ve got to keep your head down and always trying to improve what you can on yourself, and today it paid off. So yeah, big congrats to the guys and a great way to restart the second part of the year, I mean, we knew we were starting outside the points and there was this rain coming. Took a good start and out of that last corner, I saw the rain, I could see the intensity, and I saw the opportunity and the reward. So I called it straightaway. I wanted to box, also to benefit from a slightly drier track to warm up the tyres on that first lap. And it really worked out well. So it put us in a strong position, fourth place straightaway. Then there were 71 laps to go. So still a pretty long day at the office. But it felt great. We managed to pull away from the Ferrari, we had a five second penalty, which wasn't great and put us back behind Carlos, which we had to overtake after that. But all in all, there's some very good pace and good calls from the team and good strategy. So I'm happy to start this second part of the season in that way. It's never easy to stay within five seconds of a Red Bull, that's for sure. But you know, I mean, I saw the opportunity, I knew what was on the table and yeah, just gave everything I had out there. And actually, I expected to struggle a bit more with a warm-up initially, but the conditions were not too bad. So, it was yeah, pretty much a couple of qualifying laps at the end, which were really rewarding and I can feel what he was feeling: I went through it a couple laps before with these five seconds penalties. So yeah, I just tried to get everything I could. I think it does give some confidence. I think it's definitely coming more together with a team. It’s obviously this sort-of adaptation part, since the start of the year, trying to learn from each-other. Last weekend in Spa we had a good top-three finish in the Sprint in Intermediate conditions, like in the wet. Again today, we managed to make the best out of these conditions. There is a clear trend that the car seems to work a bit better in the wet. Now we’ve got to improve and keep working because we’re still slightly further back in the dry. But there were definitely some good signs of pace today and we need to go from there. Well, it's obviously very satisfying when you get a reward for the work that we're all putting in in the team. I think objectively, you’ve got to look at the package that you’ve got. And obviously last year, with AlphaTauri we were nowhere near a podium finish at any point.  We just didn't have the speed. I think this year we came close in Monaco, running in third position and it was clearly a missed opportunity, with the, sort of, extra stop, which wasn't necessary. But no, it's a sort of season where you’ve just got to keep trying, just keep trying again and again and there’s going to be a point where things are going to click and today it did, and it was probably the most challenging race of the year. There were a lot of obstacles. There were many moments where we could have got it wrong. But as a team, we just tried to maximise that and that's why I'm really pleased and I'm really proud of the team, because we haven't been really fortunate but you’ve got to keep trying and keep looking at yourself and seeing the areas where you can improve. And that's what we've been doing. The top three in Spa didn't feel the same. Obviously, it was a third place, but it's a Sprint and I didn't get to go on the podium. But clearly, this one feels a lot better. And I hope we can build up from there with the guys.",Netherlands,post-race,Alpine
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, it was a very intense race, obviously at the beginning with wet conditions we were very, very fast. And we stopped maybe one lap too late, but the same as the leaders. And yeah, the car was flying today – very competitive, very easy to drive. In these conditions, you need a car that you can trust and I did try the car a lot today. So, I did enjoy, thanks to all the fans. The energy that we live here in Zandvoort is very unique. It was two years ago when this race came, I thought I will never experience maybe the Zandvoort podium because I was not in a position to think about that. And today it’s going to be very special to share the podium with Max and Pierre now. Yeah, it is one of those races that is difficult, as you said, to concentrate, to stay focused for such a long period of time but yeah, as I said, I think this is a very special race track, with all the fans and the energy going on, so you feel always very focused. Happy for Max, congratulations to everyone. I did think about trying a move in the last restart but then I thought maybe I cannot exit the circuit so I stayed calm in second. Yes, today the car was really working really well. And yeah, I felt confident driving. I had trust in the car, which obviously in these conditions you need that level of trust in how much you push. And yeah, the car was fast in dry, it was fast on Inters and probably our most competitive part was at the beginning of the race when it was just a few drops of rain but we still were on the slick Tire. And yeah, quickly we switched to the Inters, so we could not capitalise on that. But we still made some moves – in Turn 3 at the start, on Alex and George, and also on Lando on lap two. So yeah, I was quite happy with the race and it was one of those Sundays where you feel connected with the car, you feel in sync with the car, and everything you do, the car is just answering perfectly. I think it's too early to say. I think that the car is better than the previous events that's for sure. I felt the car was, as I said, easier to drive. We were more competitive. We've been in the top five in every session this weekend. It was not only in the race where we were fast. I think we felt competitive since Friday. But Monza next week is a completely different layout, minimum downforce there and drag. And let's see if we can still be competitive. I was thinking about trying. So I was not conservative, let's say! I thought about what to do, a lot, in the red flag period. So I thought, what were the possibilities, obviously, the move into Turn 2 was something that was in my head, also into Turn 1. I discussed it with the team as well. That was my feeling, that I wanted to try today. But obviously, I don't want to compromise any big points for the team, because second was very important as well. But they were happy with me to try. I think they have the trust in me as well and in whatever I decide. So yeah, at the restart, I tried in Turn 4 launching the lap, trying to be flat in the banking with the cold tyres, which is a little bit risky, and tried to be side-by-side at least into Turn 1 but I was not that close. So after that I tried some different lines – inside, outside – the opposite of Max for the first lap, in case one of the lines was very grippy or much grippier than he is. And yeah, it was close, but not enough. It was FP1 or FP2 it was wet and in one of the out-laps I let a few cars go on the normal racing line and I found a lot of grip on the inside casually, by just letting people go. So, I kept in my head, all the time, all the weekend, in case it was wet. I was ready to try again and, to be honest, when we were on the grid, and the red lights were on for the start of the race, there were a lot of drops in the visor. So, that's the worst feeling you can have. Because you are ready to start the race on a slick tyre, and on your visor, you see that it’s raining, So, you have no idea of the grip that you will find in Turn 1 braking, or Turn 3. So, I thought everyone will be a little bit cautious in Turn 3 with the grip level, and also just outside Turn 3 there is paint in the Aramco, so you have to be a little bit cautious there. So I thought about the inside line, it could work and yeah, we overtook those two cars. Definitely, that should be the overtake of the month, again. I hope. Yeah, it is underestimated sometimes what Max is achieving. I agree with the comment and the question that your colleague made before. I think to win in such a dominant matter in any of the professional sports, it is so complicated. So to be at the same level of him, obviously, we have a lot of self-confidence, drivers in general. So I do believe that I can do good as well as well. I don’t know about Lewis, but me, yes! And Lewis as well, and everyone, I think you need to enter in a mood, in a state that you are, as I said before, connected with a car. I think days like today, I felt that I was at my best and have been giving 100% of what I felt and my abilities on a racing car, but maybe in Spa I was not at that level or in Austria or something like that. So you always feel that there is room to improve and you are not 100% happy with yourself, as I am today. And I think Max is achieving that 100% more often than us at the moment, than any of the drivers, so that's why he's dominating.",Netherlands,post-race,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Incredible and also today they didn't make it easy for us I think with the weather to make all the time the right calls. But yeah, incredibly proud. I mean, I already had goose bumps when they were playing the national anthem before the start. And you know, even with all the bad weather, the rain, the fans were still going at it, so an incredible atmosphere. I'll think about it next week. I'm first going to enjoy this weekend. You know it's always tough. The pressure is on to perform and very happy of course to win here. Yeah, it's fantastic. Look at this [shows bags of sweets]. I got this now. It's the highlight of the day for me. Well, yeah, I mean, the race itself was very hectic, of course. I mean, lining up and seeing the rain coming down, yeah, it was tough to make the right calls. I mean, I thought together with the team, you know, they told me, like, the rain is coming, but maybe not enough to switch to an Inter or maybe survive for a few laps, you know, so we decided together to stay out for one more lap, but that at the end of day was then the wrong call. But it made the race definitely more fun, because from there onwards I had to pass a few cars, I had to close the gap up front. But luckily I think within a few laps I closed down like 10 seconds of the gap. So that was very important for the rest of my race. And when we went on to the slick tyres as well, I think that the tyres were holding on quite well on the car for my stint and it was very enjoyable to drive. But then you think you're going to have, let's say, an easy ride home, and then they tell me 10, 15 laps before the end, there's some rain coming again. And this time it was not just some rain, it was quite a lot. So we pit for Inters and within a lap it almost becomes undriveable on an Inter and we opted to go to an extreme. But the problem we have at the moment is that the Intermediate is basically too good compared to the extreme. So even when there's a downpour like that you still actually want to be on an Inter because it's faster, but at one point there were so many rivers on the track it just becomes incredibly dangerous. So at the time, I was a bit, well, not upset, but disappointed with the red flag. But I guess in hindsight, with so many people on Intermediates it was probably the right thing to do. Yeah, it was quick on the Intermediates and quick on the Soft tyres as well. Yeah, I think the first laps on the slicks were quite stressful. You don't want to immediately go off the track. And also knowing how much grip there is still out there on the tyres, with the amount of water coming down, was not easy. And of course the final restart, you know, with seven laps ago, six laps to go or whatever, I knew that my first lap the whole weekend already has not been the best with warm-up, so I knew that I had to survive that first lap. And yeah, Fernando was pushing very hard behind and I could see him close in my mirrors. But once I had the temperature in my tyres it was all well balanced again. Yeah, it was probably one of the more difficult races to win again. But yeah, nine in a row was something I never even thought about. So yeah, very happy with that. But I think I'm in general very happy to win here in front of my own crowd. Yeah. Especially in the beginning. And also, when you have this kind of tricky race, for sure, it was a lot about risk management. I mean, when I compare it to a few years ago, where I'm not fighting for the championship, I'm driving completely different for sure. But that's fine. I mean, even while driving like this, I know that they have a car, which is capable of a lot. So that probably helps to, to be a little bit more in control, I guess. Yeah, absolutely, I mean, even if you have the best – and I think there have been more dominant cars in the past than what we have at the moment and they haven’t been able to do so, to win nine in a row, whatever, the consecutive wins we have as a team. So yeah, it is hard and especially like today, it’s easy to make a wrong call or even drop it yourself in the gravel or whatever. So, yeah, it’s never that straightforward unfortunately. I mean, I knew I had good pace on the Intermediates and I knew that when I had to push, the whole weekend already, you know we were quick. So, it was more about just keeping them alive for whenever you would need them, if there was more rain coming or whatever. So, in the beginning, I think, it was pretty good. But yeah, to compare the wins, I think all of them have been different. So, this one definitely was definitely the hardest one to make all them the right calls to the end. Yeah, I think I learned a lot from the race in Baku, how to do some things with the car, how to set it up. Of course, I didn't win that race in Baku but actually I really tried a lot of stuff and different tools in the car. That's why throughout the race it was a little bit inconsistent, but at one point, I got into a good rhythm with what I found. But then I damaged my tyres a bit too much. But it was like ‘OK, that's quite interesting for the next races’. And I basically implemented that and it has helped me on every track. Yeah, I mean, that lap was definitely too dry in the back, but it started raining, like, on the main street, for example. Then I went again and I came again through Sector 2 and it was still dry. But I don't know, of course, what's going on the main straight or Turn 1 and apparently it was really coming down. So then the team told me ‘no, no, you have to come in this lap’. So, it's a bit of feeling, I think, also, from both sides, you know. Sometimes it can be a little bit more up to you , sometimes a bit more up to the team. And at the end of the day, you have to trust each other in making the right call. And I was very happy that they called me in that the second time around.",Netherlands,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a very tricky Qualifying. Starting, of course, with the Intermediates but also, the track surface is quite slippery, the new tarmac. So yeah, it was all about putting your laps in but also staying out of trouble. I think we managed that quite well but then also at the end, when we could go onto the slick tyres again, there was like one dry line in some places and we had to risk it a bit – but that last lap was very enjoyable. Yeah, I mean, we’ve been to some other places already where we’ve had wet races and stuff, and I think this was the first time we came here with this kind of conditions. So, I think we underestimated maybe a little bit, with the wind as well, and then the sun coming out, how quickly it dries. So, it’s again all about experience and lessons you take forward but at the end of the day, it didn't matter. We still did the right thing. Yeah, I mean the pressure is always there to perform. When you can pull it off, it’s incredible. It was quite slippery out there. So, it was easy to make a mistake or whatever, especially on the new tarmac, so Sector One, Sector Three was quite slippery. And especially on the Intermediates, in the beginning, to get the temperature and get going was a bit difficult. And you had to do a few laps to get into a rhythm and have the tyres up to temperature. And then of course, we were getting closer to Q3, it was drying out. I initially didn't think it was going to be dry enough but I think with the wind around here, and then the sun coming out, it actually dried faster than I expected. So, I went out on the Inter and then quickly realised that was the wrong tyre. So we boxed, put the slick on but then unfortunately, of course, there was a red flag. But it was still very tricky, I think, conditions in Turns One and Two at the time, like only one proper dry line. So, it's easy to get to make a mistake. And then, of course, we had a bit of a delay. And then, of course, also Charles had his moment. So, at one point, the dry line was becoming a bit wider. So, that, I think, helped a bit. But then again, you know, you have to really get a bit out of your comfort zone in that final lap because it's still not entirely dry everywhere. But luckily the lap was good. I started the lap, I went into Turn One, I though, oh, that’s it, I braked way too late. So probably my Turn One wasn't fantastic. But I think the rest of the lap was okay. I felt okay with the car. I think in general, when you have the pace in the car, you can overtake even though, of course, on this track is a little bit harder than maybe on some other tracks. But if you're really faster, you will be able to pass. But it's always nice in front of your home crowd, you know, to take pole position. I mean, they come here, and they expect you to do it but it's not always that easy. And especially with a qualifying like this. It's never that straightforward and you always need to be out at the right time. But luckily, we did that. I've had a few good ones. Well, I guess Spa didn't count, did it? That was probably also really satisfying. But I mean, we've had a lot of these qualifyings lately where we start in the wet, go to the dry. It's always quite entertaining, I think. No, not really, I know I made a few mistakes, probably three-tenths worth, which puts me two-tenths off, and I think that's about right. Yeah, I didn't know of course what to expect with other teams coming in but they have been quick all weekend and they've been quick in the wet, they've been quick and dry so that's very impressive to see. And that's great for the sport as well, that more teams are up there. And yeah, very happy for Alex himself. He's a great guy, he was my teammate before. We always had a good time and yeah, very happy for him to be up there and have - for at least this weekend - a very competitive car. I think, yeah, low speed... I'd also… like bumpy tracks, kerbs. Like max downforce, high downforce, probably we would like to have a bit more, but at the moment, you can't have everything. So it's also a way of the philosophy of our design team, how they designed the car. So not all the tracks, of course, are high downforce. Of course, you always try to optimise things so I think it's literally trying to find little improvements here and there and that's what we continue to do. Well, there's a difference between racing and doing qualifying and normally qualifying you always look for your own spot, you create a bit of a gap and I think everything was absolutely fine. But again, it's so easy to make a mistake when it's quite slippery out there or when you go from intermediates to slick tyres while the track is still a bit damp. So yeah, mistakes are easily made, but I think it was definitely safe enough to drive. I know how challenging the track is in the dry and the wet from before so yeah, I think also with drivers I think we like in other places where you have a lot of runoff, even when you make a tiny mistake you just go through the extra tarmac run-off or whatever and you continue here. In some places, that is just not possible. And especially then to really pull the lap out when it matters, it is definitely more challenging than most places we go to. I have done this now quite a few times in my career, during the qualifyings, it doesn't matter. Of course, if you have the best car or the worst car on the grid, like the kind of approach you have is the same: when it really matters, you try to do the best lap you can. And after my first run in Q3, it was not good enough so I had a few places to improve but I knew that… of course at the end of qualifying you always risk a bit more but it was more like a banker lap. But it's still good to see where you can improve and you're just thinking about that. And then once you drive out you look at how much the track has dried and how much more you're able to push in some places compared to the previous laps; that's what you do. Well, I think after like five wins in a row or something like that, Seb texted me, you know ‘well done, what you're doing at the moment, keep it up’ and something like ‘you’re going to do it’. But you know, I was like, ‘that's nine wins in a row, it’s something very impressive’ and I never thought I will be able to be already on eight. I mean, if it's possible tomorrow of course I’ll go for it, but it's not something I have in the back of my head, constantly like ‘I need to do this, I need to do this’. I'm not in this sport to try and break records. I'm just here to win in the moment. I mean, I know that they start very well. But I think mainly you just think about your own strategy. And then of course, you go through the scenarios that in case you got passed, or whatever, you know, there are a lot of things that you take into account for tomorrow. But mainly you focus on your own strategy, because that's what you can control. So that's what we'll do. Ask them to repeat that! Honestly, I don't know why I went off. I wasn't even pushing. I just suddenly lost the car. Maybe it was just going too slow to the corner. But yeah, that last bit of the banking was extremely slippery for whatever reason, if it was rubber or dirt laying around. So yeah, the line on the exit was a little bit different to the dry for a long time. But yeah, I don't know why, in general, I think just that new tarmac was very slippery. And maybe with the banking, it made it a bit more tricky. Well, I mean, I have to give the trophy anyway to the team, so do what you want! Well, I think this one looks quite solid. I mean, it's different material. I guess we'll find out there.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Thank you. No, I’m happy still. P2 was a good result, I guess, in these kind of conditions. Every now and again you hope Max makes a mistake and he doesn’t. Frustrating in a little way but I’m very happy. The team’s done a good job. It was a chaotic qualifying but another P2, so… good. Qualifying is always stressful, no matter what the conditions. But definitely now it’s definitely trickier. Like the first half of the lap was mega, the second half was probably one of the worst second halves that I’ve done! So, it peaked very early on. It’s tought, but I really enjoy these conditions. I’ve always enjoyed the conditions, it’s when we do well. So, I’m taking the P2 still. The driver! The driver. Tyres were good ‘til the end. The driver peaked very early, so I’ve got a bit of work to do. Not the most comfortable but good enough, so I’ll take it. I thought there was a chance at least. I knew my lap in Q3, Run 1 was decent but I knew everyone's going to improve a huge amount. I knew there was plenty of places and time for me to gain on that lap. So, it's difficult because even when you think you're doing… you know, I was one second up after already, what, six corners, seven corners? It gets you a bit excited. But you know, everyone else is probably doing a similar thing. So, my first half a lap was very good, my second half was pretty terrible. I had a double shift out of Turn 10, which probably cost me a couple of tenths, but at the same time, nothing would have got me enough to get past Max. He did a good job. These conditions, where you hope something might come your way and it didn't today, but P2 was a good result for us. No, no. It's never a surprise anymore. I’ll challenge him probably two laps, then he’ll drive away. I think there's quite a bit of tyre degradation here and not our forte, let's say, when it comes into play, we start to struggle quite a bit in certain corners. But we've improved the car quite a bit, I think, since Friday, so I want to be a little bit more hopeful. I'm not going to say no, like I’m not going to give it a try, but Max is always on another level when it comes to Sunday, in tyre degradation and race pace. So, there's opportunities, but it's going to be tough. I mean, I think we're pretty reassured already after Silverstone, that things were looking a lot better. Even after Austria, we were confident things took a big step forward. And they did and we went on to score two podiums, had a tricky Spa, but still a P7. And we come to a track which we know suits us a bit more and we proved it today again. So, the team has done an excellent job – I've said countless times, but they've really made a massive step forward from where we were to where we are now. And days like this, when you reward them, is always a good thing. So, we’ll keep pushing. I keep saying we’re not far away, but at the same time, we’re still quite far. So yeah, we'll keep our heads down. I wouldn't say it's a big, big surprise because they've been very competitive at certain places but every now and then, like Silverstone was a similar thing. He was P1 through practice and so on. Now, they just managed to keep it more through qualifying and into Q3 especially. So I’m happy for him and the whole team. Logan was there all the way pretty much into Q3. They look strong, they made some big progress this season. And yes, good to have them in the battle too.
GR: Yeah, similar to what the guys said, really pleased to see him up there and it goes to show when you get your confidence how that can really transform the performance but Williams is making a huge amount of progress at the moment and I think James Vowles is having a really positive impact there. I think he's definitely the best man for the job for what Williams need at the moment for their resurgence. Yeah, it's great to see more than just the top teams fighting and that's what we want in Formula 1, we want everybody to have a chance if they do a good job. I'll say no, just because there's been times when we’ve been very close, you know? Yeah, there's been plenty of times it's been super, super close, whether Max has made a mistake and therefore it's close or not, but there's two differences, whether it’s Qualifying or the race. I think in the race, at the minute, we’ve kind of got no chance unless someone gets unlucky or he gets unlucky and something happens. Just got a very good driver in a good car and he's doing the job he needs to do. So I think full respect to that. But I wouldn't say no, because there's always a chance, like on a day like today when he can make a mistake. Sadly, he doesn't, but it can happen. It happens to everyone and it can still happen to him. So there's a time and a place and we’re kind of still waiting, everyone's waiting for it to happen, but just not today. Sadly, I would say I'm still more worried about the people behind than the car in front, which is, I think, still a good thing. You know, we didn't expect to really challenge the Red Bull at all when we had the upgrade in Austria. And I think we're still pleasantly surprised by how competitive we've been. A mixture of us taking a step forward and, you know, Aston taking, I would say, a step backward from where they were at the beginning of the season, and Ferrari just not looking as good as they were last year or they were also in the beginning of the season. So there's definitely more to come. Even like the rear wing that we have. We've chose this one today just because of a, yeah, safety with these conditions, you know, and not wanting to… We lost one yesterday, so just want to make sure I’ve got it for future weekends. So there was a bit of lag time in the bag, right? If we just used the other rear wing we brought this weekend, it’s a step forward, it's a more efficient wing. But we chose not to use it. So there are little things that we're going to consistently try to bring. Maybe not for much longer, because there's a time when we focus to next year. But there’s more to come and I think because the car has taken so many big steps forward, we're confident that it’s alive and there's more things to improve. No, nothing more to add. Just the conditions, I mean, we've seen people crash last year, right? And the year before. I think Carlos had quite a big one there last year. So it can just catch you out. It’s easy to make that kind of mistake. I guess Oscar made it yesterday, too. Tough, especially with these conditions, it’s even easier, just because you feel like you can attack it so much but as you kind of hit the dip a lot of things can happen, then the grip feels good, but then almost gets a lot worse the closer to the exit you get. You feel like you can almost overdo it very easily. So it's a good challenge in both conditions, but even more so in the rain.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, absolutely. Really great session, happy to be here in P3. Quali was one of my strengths at the start of the year and it’s just been going a little bit wrong recently, so it was good to have that break, came in with a fresh set of ideas, good reset and we’re in a great place tomorrow to fight for a podium. The lap was OK, to be honest. We know we always struggle either when it’s very wet or it’s the crossover onto slicks and we’ve got to get that temperature into the tyres but we know the Saturday is the strength on Sundays. It’s going to be an exciting race. I’m sure Max will be having his Sunday drive and waving to the crowd on his way tomorrow – but hopefully we can have a good fight with Alex, Lando and the rest of the guys. Yeah. I’m really happy for Williams and for Alex. I said before the session, I saw the guys on the pit-wall looking pretty happy with their performance and I flew over here with Alex, and I said ‘what are your expectations for the weekend?’ and he said ‘I think we’re going to be rubbish!’ so, he got that one slightly wrong! As I said, really well done to Max but also to Alex and Williams. Yeah, very satisfied to be honest. Qualifying was one of my strengths at the start of the year and generally a session that I really enjoyed but the last few races before the break had been a real struggle for me. Things were pretty scrappy and was never really going towards us and had some bad sessions so it was good to have the little break, coming into this weekend with a fresh set of eyes: a good reset. And really please just to get back in the groove and put in a good performance. I think what Max said… it’s always very challenging in those conditions. You have 10/15 minutes waiting for a red flag, you go out one lap, the track’s evolved by a second and a half or two seconds. I was pretty satisfied with the lap. There's obviously always more you can do. I think we always tend to struggle a bit when the track’s either very wet and you're trying to get the temperature in the intermediate tyres, or on that crossover when it's just going to slicks and you're trying to get the temperature into the slicks. So to end up P3 in those conditions I was very happy but we know we have a faster car on Sunday so starting third is a great spot. Yeah, I think it's going to be a good race. As Lando said, a lot of tyre degradation so it gives you a few opportunities with the strategy. I don't think we'll have the pace to fight with Max. As Lando said, he's a bit of a league of his own at the moment, but I'm confident Lando and I can have a good fight. Obviously great to see Alex there in P4. He'll probably be in the mix at the beginning of the race and then we'll have to see the progress of Checo. He's probably going to be the next threat from behind. Yeah, same as Lando, definitely. I think Max and Red Bull are doing an amazing job at the moment. But I think we just need to turn up a little bit more, apply a little bit more pressure. I think they’ve got a really nice buffer at the moment. And when you're in that rhythm, you're in that groove, you can afford to make a small mistake and still be in a really great spot. There's a lot less pressure than when you know if you make a small mistake, it's going to cost you a couple of positions. So we're going to keep on working. You know, for sure, they're the guys to beat at the moment. But we just need to focus on ourselves. Keep looking in the mirror, and just seeing where we can improve. And we'll get there. We'll get there. I think going back to the small point on pressure before, I think when you continue to focus on yourself, you don't worry about anybody else, you just get in that groove and you keep on moving forward and you find yourself in a really good spiral and when things start to get a little bit more challenging you want to work harder you want to focus on the details and I think sometimes myself and the small team around me were maybe overthinking things, chasing the last millisecond, but not focusing too much on the temps that we could lose if we get the traffic wrong in Qualifying or if we're not getting the tyres in the right window. Then, you know, even a few things in my personal life, just making sure that there's as little to worry about as possible. And this break was so, so needed for me, spending some time with my family, with my friends. And you know, just coming into this weekend in a really good spot. Feeling good about myself, feeling happy, feeling refreshed and I think a lot is to be said about just being in the right frame of mind. You guys are playing with us here. That’s not the name [laughs] I feel like a lot of circuits, recently, they re-tarmac parts of the track if it's a bit bumpy, or if the tarmac is degrading, and then you find you've got half of the track which is really old tarmac and it's sort of broken up and you have got really good grip from the wet tyres and the new tarmac is like a bit like a bowling alley. So in the dry conditions, there's lots of grip. But as soon as there's a bit of water down there, it gets really slippery, and just trying to judge that across a lap when you've got first corner is old tarmac, second, third corners are new tarmac, then old tarmac, back to new tarmac, you just got to be aware of these small details.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"No, I think it was just a safer call. I mean, I could come in first, but I might be blocked by other cars, there might be a Safety Car and then you lose-out massively, so, I didn’t mind to stay out. I mean, we lost one position, but we know that we are quick and I think that you could see that when we put the Inter tyres on. We were flying. So it was OK. I don’t know. I mean, I need to pass a few cars ,so I think the biggest risk is just lap one, Turn 1. All these kind of things. Everything is always very tricky there. As long as we stay out of trouble, I think we’ll have a quick car. I think just to make the call when to pit. I said already to the team, I know we can pit straight away. It’s very risky in case of having all the cars come in as well, who would pit behind me, and then of course you have to hold your car, or a Safety Car lap one, you never know, that can happen quite often in these kind of conditions. So, I think we just took the safer option to at least do one lap. Maybe there would be a Safety Car and you’re unlucky. There wasn’t a Safety Car so I knew I wouldn’t lose out, because the extreme tyres are a lot slower around here than an Inter. So yeah, we did the pitstop. I had a little wait as well for the Ferrari, and I came out behind Oscar and then of course I knew I had to get by him at some point. I could see that within two laps, he was already struggling a lot more with the tyres. Like they were just overheating more and then I guess with our top speed as well, I had a good run after the Safety Car. Yeah… first time? It’s always good. I mean, I’ve been in that position as well, where the younger guy comes in. It’s nice, and it’s great also. I think Oscar is having a very strong season in general, but I think also this weekend he has been really on it. It’s always nice to, for the first time, basically, race. yeah, car was quick. We knew already over one lap we were anyway not bad, but also in the race it seemed like we were quite good on keeping the tyres alive. So hopefully, we can do the same tomorrow if it’s dry. But tomorrow, of course, I’m starting a bit further back. I need to be careful to not have any damage on the car. And as soon as I have a clean lap one, I think from there onwards, yeah, we can move forwards. I think the rolling start was a smart thing to do in these kinds of conditions because I think nobody could really see what was happening in front, and especially on the new tarmac around here, there’s a lot more standing water, so I think it would have been quite dangerous out of Turn One and through Eau Rouge, and I don’t think you want that when all the cars are super-close and there is a little moment. So, I think that was a good choice. I think we could have raced a little bit earlier – maybe two laps earlier – but again, I prefer to do it like this than go out there when it’s unsafe and they release us. So, it’s OK. I think it really depends on the conditions we are facing:  how wet it is, visibility-wise. Every track is a little bit different with that. I think here it was probably quite a safe view on things but I prefer that than risking it and going too early. But other tracks again, maybe it's a bit different. I don't think it needs to be clear four or five laps. I fully get Pierre’s comments because I think it has become worse from when I started in F1. I think it's just the wider tyres we have and the ground effect cars. But I remember also in the junior categories, it was also quite tough, the visibility was very bad. Unfortunately, of course, we had these accidents happen over the years and probably… that's always the unfortunate thing, I guess, with some things where we then try to improve stuff on it, something bad needs to happen before [it] really gets changed or gets looked at. But I remember races in F3 where I couldn't see a thing when you're in the pack or whatever. And also today, for example, I couldn't even see the Safety Car sometimes, and I'm the first guy. So that's not even an F1 car, so if we really want to get rid of it, we can't do a race at the moment in the wet if we want good visibility and this is also something we have to look at. But then also another thing is we really quickly, at the moment, want to go from an extreme to an Inter, even when there is a bit of standing water around so I think also the shift between the tyres, the extreme needs to work at a better window as well so we don't need to always go straight to an Inter, but that's again a different problem because of course visibility is probably the most important because if you don't see where you're going that's not what you want.",Belgium,post-sprint,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Very, very happy, we tried our best. We boxed when the Safety Car came in, led a few laps, tried my best but we were no match for Max. Nice to be up there in P2. I think, apart from Max, our pace was really strong, so full credit to the team again. The last three weekends we’ve had, it’s been pretty special, compared to where we have been. So, I can’t thank them enough for the car. We’ve still got a little bit of work to do – clearly – to get right to the top, but it’s a lot nicer to be up there. To lead my first laps was a day I won’t forget. I thought the Safety Car was going to be in my favour – it meant less laps to try to hold him behind, but I looked out of Turn 1, I felt like I got a decent restart, I looked at the top of Eau Rouge and he was basically on top of me already. I couldn’t keep him behind on the straight. Clearly, we have a little more work to do but I’m very happy to get the good points. First… I would say podium but I don’t really know what this is… so first top three in a sort-of race. I’ll enjoy it and hopefully we can have a good race tomorrow. Yeah, it was a good Sprint. I think it was pretty obvious for us to box on the first lap. Obviously we had the same risk as Max of potentially getting stuck with everyone coming it – but it worked out really well and managed to lead a few laps, which was cool. So really enjoyed it. Think we struggled a bit with keeping the tyres alive. Yeah, that was pretty much all we could have achieved today, so I’m very happy. I mean you're always focusing on trying to just do the best laps you can. I mean, when you've got Max and his car behind you, it doesn’t put your nerves at ease, put it that way. So I knew it was going to be difficult to hold him behind, of course. I probably wasn't expecting him to catch me literally at the top of Eau Rouge after the Safety Car restart, but such is our straight line speed. So yeah, it was cool. I was just focusing on trying to do the best job I could, knowing that it was probably going to be a when Max came past, rather than an if. But yeah, I tried my best. And I think second was all we all had. We didn't. Yeah, I mean, I've done quite a few Safety Car restarts before, so it's nothing new. But of course, you just try and do the best job you can in tricky conditions, with quite low tyre temps at that point. So yeah, I tried the best that I could. I think I went a bit wide at Turn 1, which didn't help things, but I don't think it really made much difference. No, it was nice to be able to control a Safety Car restart again and hopefully there's a few more opportunities in the future. I feel like it's going well. I wouldn't say it's particularly linear, in my development. I feel like Silverstone was the best weekend so far. I think in Budapest, there were still a few things that I needed to learn and work on. I think here's been obviously quite strong today. Yesterday, maybe there was a bit left on the table. So, it's not always linear. I think especially in the conditions we've had this weekend, it's so easy to always want more and more and then you find yourself in the wall. So you know, I've got to keep my expectations in check. But I feel like in a general trend, it's going in the right direction. I'm getting more and more comfortable with the car. Of course the car is much, much better now than it was at the start of the year, which of course helps, with just the feeling of the car, but also knowing that if you do a good job, you can fight for the top three. It helps so yeah, I feel like it's in the right direction. There'll be ups and downs I'm sure but hopefully it's more ups. Yeah. I think for us, it was pretty clear we would box for Inters. And then, you know, there's always the risk that maybe you hit some standing water or whatever, but I could see how quickly I was catching the guys ahead that stayed out on Wets and knew I'd be in a pretty decent spot. You know, I think with Zhou maybe I could have been a little bit more aggressive. But yeah, in the end, it was enough. I think we were quite fortunate that we managed to do a normal stop when we did, because otherwise, if you have a car that's one second further ahead or closer to and then they have this five behind, you can easily lose five, six seconds. So that worked out very well in our favour. But yeah, I think for us, it was always quite clear it would be Inters and we made the most of it. I would have been very happy. I think before the season, maybe we thought that that could be possible, in the right circumstances with maybe a few cars not finishing. Of course once we got the season underway, it was a pretty distant dream that we'd be able to compete for the top three and to now be here, consistently for the last three weekends is yeah, pretty remarkable. No, it's been amazing for me of course. It's always a nice motivation when you know you can do a good job. The car is there to finish in the top three, but I don't think it changes too much of what I'm trying to do myself. I'm always trying to get the most out of myself. I still have plenty to learn and just getting back up to speed with some things still.  So from that aspect, it doesn't change too much. But when you can walk away with a trophy or a sprint plaque thing it's cool. So yeah, hopefully we can get some more and keep pushing forward. It's flattering to have those comments. I'm very happy where I am. But yeah, it's always nice to be talked about in those kinds of ways. I think my season's been quite good for the most part, I think there's definitely been some mistakes or moments I wish I could have had again, but with hindsight, it's very easy to say those kinds of things. So yeah, I'm happy with where I'm at driving-wise, there's still a lot to improve, a lot to learn. I've got a very strong teammate to learn from who just by being a benchmark is a big help for me getting back up to speed. So yeah, I'm happy where I am.",Belgium,post-sprint,McLaren
Pierre Gasly,"Well, yeah, I must say, it feels amazing. I’m extremely happy to finish in the top three, especially here in Spa, which feels some kind of home race for us without the French Grand Prix. So, it was a very, very difficult conditions but no, I’m extremely happy. We pitted at the right time and managed to hold off Lewis until the end, so it does feel very special to do it here as well in Spa and obviously, I have a thought for Anthoine. I’m just extremely pleased for the whole team because it hasn’t been the smoothest start to the year and managed to put things together here today. Yeah, I must say I gave it everything. I could see him coming back, getting closer and I was just trying to focus on my driving, making clean laps, one after the other. It wasn’t easy, the tyres were degrading, and I just gave it all and it paid off. I’m just super-happy for all the guys and I will go for it again tomorrow. Well, I think you summed it up pretty well. I think the last few races have been pretty unsuccessful and involved all sorts of incidents. So a bit of bad luck there. So yeah, it means quite a lot, actually, to be able to just put a strong Quali this morning and a strong race this afternoon. We know in terms of performance it hasn't been as good as we would have liked since the start of the year. But in these conditions like today everything can happen and you need to play with the cards that you have. I think we definitely did the right choice in boxing on lap one and then from there it was a bit of survival mode, with first Sergio in the mirrors and then after Lewis for a couple of laps. But, yeah, we managed to hold him off until the end and really, really pleased to finish in the top three today. This weekend, we kind of set up the car for dry conditions and especially for the race, like trying to target straight line speed, so in these conditions there is a compromise and I knew we will not be the most competitive or the fastest out there, but I knew it would not be that easy for other guys to pass us. So it was about putting in clean laps, not doing any mistakes. And Lewis has been fast all weekend, so I knew he would be putting some pressure. He caught up pretty quickly. But then yeah, I just managed to hold him off until the end. So I'm really pleased for the whole team, because as you mentioned earlier, it hasn't been an easy season. There's quite a lot of changes going on inside the team. So I'm really pleased for the guys to put a positive note to the start of the season so far. Yeah, well see. I mean, it's obviously a great result. We know the conditions probably played in our favour, we risked it and it paid off. I think on pure pace we know it's extremely tough for us at the minute to be fighting for top three or top five. So I think we definitely need to take one race at a time and tomorrow we'll start slightly further back. But yeah, we'll give it a go and I really hope we can fight our way back to the top 10. I think what's most important for me is the impact that it has inside the team. More than the podium itself. It's a Sprint race. It obviously sounds good and you get a little trophy, but you don't really jump on the box and stand on the podium. So it's a slightly different feeling. But nonetheless, you know, we take it. We finished that Sprint race in the top three. It was difficult conditions, and not easy to keep it to the end. I'm really, really pleased for the guys, for the mood inside the garage. And yeah, everyone who's been working since the start of the year. I think personally, obviously to do this in Spa, it's been a tough season, really unlucky so far and to kind of have these turning points here in Spa with obviously the history and the incidents that happened in the past year for me. It's definitely meaningful. So really, really happy to get it here. Yeah, yeah, for sure it's been quite a, let's say, busy last few weeks for the team. It's kind of tricky for me to really comment on anything . I obviously just joined at the start of the year and it's quite a big step when you come inside a new team and need to work with new people. And I must say from Laurent to Otmar to Alan, even Pat that I could see at the factory, they work in the best way and the best way possible. I think it was quite unfortunate that this season, at the minute, doesn't work out as well as we expected it and we're not making the progress that we will like, but yeah, for sure,  it's been kind of join and with all these changes happening, it’s  quite a lot at the minute. But yeah, as I said, at the moment I can only thank all these guys: Laurent, Otmar, Alan and Pat for what they've done in the first six months and I just wish (them) the best for the future. Yeah. I think I have a slightly different view than Max, based on the comments I think.  Mostly you can only compare to your position at the time and I was in sixth position and (I’m) pretty sure like when your first or second it’s slightly different and when you are at the back it's probably worse. So I don't think my opinion is really…  you’ve got to ask all 20 drivers based on what they felt but I could not see a thing. If Oscar or Max was in the middle of the straight, I would have been straight inside him. I just couldn't even see 10, 20 metres ahead of me and even when we were all warming up the tyres and stuff, it was just… you're just hoping for the best, but I didn't feel safe. When they restarted I was really hoping nothing… no guy gets off the track or collide and gets stopped in the middle of the straight because we know obviously what's happened. It's not really a question of conditions because the conditions were probably practical, raceable since the first lap but the problem is the visibility in the spray.  At the moment it’s so huge out of these cars, the water just stays in the air. I was in P6, I could not see anything so I can only imagine how bad it was at the back of the pack. And I wanted to box already straightaway for Inters but this just added another incentive to box and just have visibility because down the straight (you) just don't know what could happen. So yeah, it's a tricky call.  You want to race but at the same time I'm glad everything went safely today. But all you need is just one guy to be stopped at the wrong place in the straight and it can go wrong very quickly. So it's a tricky call, yeah.",Belgium,post-sprint,Alpine
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, a very tricky qualifying out there [sneezes] and a bit of an allergy! But it was very tricky. You know, I started on the Inter. Conditions were very tricky initially. We thought that it was going to get a lot drier, a lot quicker. But it took a long time and even there at the end in Q3, it was quite tricky in a few places like Turns 8, 9, very tricky. But it's a good result. It's a bit of a shame that I didn't get Charles there, but I think in these conditions it was good that we had a good one. Well, I think in these conditions, it's so easy for it to go wrong. We already saw in Q1, if you're on the wrong side of it, with the tyres too warm on the final lap, or so on, it can be very, very tight. Even in Q2, I had the wrong engine deployment, because I did consecutive laps, and that just puts you really, really close to the limit, you know. So it's just one of those sessions that is so tricky to find the limit, and you have to go with the track. Already, I think every single Qualifying session was quite tricky today. Well, I think certainly we have good information about the crossover times and where the circuit is damper, but it’s always changing here in Spa. So we will find out tomorrow, a new challenge, I'm sure. Yeah, well, I will try my best. I will try to get Charles at the start, which is always hard, but I think it's also a long race, high deg. So anything can happen on Sunday, but we certainly have a good position, It doesn't matter. As long as I get him. That will be my target. But I think tomorrow we’ve got a very busy day. So it feels like Sunday is miles away. I think the biggest concern is come Sunday, because we haven't done any high fuel. We don't know how the car is going to behave with heavy tanks, the ride, how it will be. It's always a massive concern going into the weekend basically blind. And yeah, like Max says, you can get it wrong very easily. Yeah, I've certainly had a rough patch with the car and with my driving style. I've been working on it. And you know, it's no different to any other driver out there. I think drivers, we go through these periods where we are just finding our sweet spot. It has happened to anyone. But yeah, it's a long season and like I always say, people only remember where you finished in Abu Dhabi. So for me, it's still a very long season ahead. I want to get my season back on track, but I know, and I've done it before, so I think we are heading in the right direction.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, not a bad qualifying for us, especially in those conditions it’s always tricky to put everything together. I put a lot of work in those conditions, as I wasn't really comfortable a few races ago. And it seemed to pay off. We went a bit too early for that last run but pole was definitely not for us today and Max was too quick, but we could have been a bit closer. Having said that, we have a great starting position for Sunday. And yeah, let's see how it goes. Yeah, it was really tricky. I had Kevin, also, that went in the wall and then continued in front of me. So I didn't put a lap in early and then you've got all the pressure on that last lap that you need to put, and in those conditions it wasn't easy. But in the end, everything went well. So yeah, happy. Having said that, there's still quite a bit of work to do in order to catch the Red Bulls. Happier, for sure. I mean, I put quite a lot of work in those conditions, half-wet, half-dry. I knew it was one of those conditions where I was still struggling with a car. I didn't have the right feeling in Barcelona, in… I cannot remember the other races we had, but we had two or three races in a row where we had those conditions. And today, I felt much better in the car, so this was positive. Still very far from Max in Q3 especially. But yeah, all in all, I think in Q3 we could have done things slightly better. I don't think pole was possible. I mean, I'm sure pole was not possible today. But we probably could have been closer going a bit later in Q3. Honestly, it's more changes with my driving style. I have quite an aggressive driving style and in those conditions, it just didn't work for me. I was making too many mistakes and it was difficult to build from a solid base. So I changed a little bit the approach and it seems to be better. Yeah, it was very difficult, especially 8/9 was horrible. You would get into the corner and you never knew how much grip you will have and you just had to trust the car to grip again, because in between 8 and 9 there was really low grip and then in the middle of 9 you will get the grip again. And you just had to trust the process. But yeah, as Max said, you can never really go over the limit in those conditions. So you just need to go step-by-step and get as close as possible in the last lap of Q3. Not confident, especially with the two Red Bull guys right behind. I think they've got a much better race car than we have. I mean, it’s great to be starting first and I think it gives us a good chance to have a great result. But to say that we'll target the win, I think it’s probably a bit too optimistic. If there's an opportunity, for whatever reason, as always, I'll try and take it, but I believe it's going to be difficult to keep those guys behind. Honestly, it is very difficult to give the details, because it's very slight changes in terms of driving style. But that makes a big difference at the end. As I said, I have a very aggressive driving style, whether it's in full wet or full dry, which pays off in those two conditions. But whenever I'm in between with slick tyres, then it doesn't really pay off. And there I tried different directions, also with tools, so the way the car is set up and the way I can change it from one corner to the other. And this gave me much more confidence straightaway. And the lap time came better. Yeah, especially for the race it’s going to be very tricky, because we didn't do any long runs. So also for tyre management and all of those things we are just going in the race with a big question mark. So yeah, it's going to be important to analyse everything very well, straight from the get-go on Sunday, trying to understand in the first few laps where it's going, where the degradation is going, how it looks like, and then adjust the strategy as quickly as possible.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was very tight. Of course, the conditions are very tricky. The track was really drying quickly. And yeah, my final lap, I just didn't have that confidence in Q2 to push more. And I was very lucky to be in P10. But then, yeah, of course in Q3, you have two tyre sets, you know that you can push a little bit more, you can risk a little bit more. And that's what we did on that final lap. And yeah, to be on pole again. I mean, I know that I have to drop back on Sunday with the penalty I have, but it was the best I could do today. I guess Sector 2 was still a bit damp, you know, so there was only really one dry line, or in some corners you had to do a bit of an alternative line to normal in the dry. And it was all about just feeling confident and basically risking everything in that final run to get more lap time. And we know that the car was quick and I think even with these tricky conditions today, luckily, we could show that again. I mean, last year, I had more penalties and we could still win the race. So that's still the target on Sunday. But let's first see tomorrow what the weather will do and what kind of racing we will have. Of course. I mean, I've been here many times. I grew up not far from here, you know, so it's definitely like a second home race for me. And it’s also great to see so many fans here. It's been, I think, quite tough today with the rain, but everyone just stuck in and that's great to see. So thank you very much. To be honest, I mean I crossed the line and… It's quite hectic out there, you know, it's still only one dry line in some places, you're still not even doing the full dry line. So, yeah, it felt alright. But honestly, I mean, I didn't know where I was until I looked on the screens. But yeah, Q3, that final lap, I think was very good. I just risked a bit more compared to all the other laps, you know, leaving a level of margin, which almost knocked me out in Q2. So yeah, it was tough out there today to get to get everything right. Well, it's more about not actually finding the limit. Because then it's very easy to make a mistake and hit the wall. So it's all about just trying to leave your margins and just build up to it, basically. But yeah, it seemed like it was a bit tougher today. I think also because the sun was out at one point, so the track was drying really quickly, lap after lap. Yeah, but honestly, I do know that we have a very good car, but I think it's more just having a bit more luck with the line or the grip. You know, I think if it would have been a full dry qualifying the gap wouldn't have been like this. Yeah, it was close, but again, I had to abort my first lap, because I went wide over the white line In Turn 9, I think, or 8, so I had to abort that lap. Then I did another slow lap. And it just felt like I probably lost a little bit too much temperature in the tyres. And then because of that mistake, I made in 9 or 8, I don't remember the corner, I just took a lot of margin there and it was way too much. And yeah, with the track ramping up that quickly, yeah, it was very, very close. I mean, last year, we started 14th and I think this year, the car is better. So I'm still targeting to win the race for sure. I think it's still the best place to do it. I think Sunday looks more and more dry. So that's why, I guess, we still went for it, basically. Mainly Turn 8/9, because I think I was incredibly slow there before, because I had a few moments. I almost crashed in 9 in Q2. So even in Q3 on my first run I was very slow there. So then on my second attempt I just went a lot faster. I mean, that happens sometimes. Most of it is normally or always blocked off. But I think we are both… We can be quite vocal or emotional. But we always solve it afterwards. It's all good. Feels like a long time ago now. Honestly, I always had this approach of like, we will see. I was like, ‘Well, you know, I made it now to Formula 1’ at the time ‘and we'll find out how it goes’. I mean, I didn't really put any expectation or whatever. I mean, I always tried to get the best out of myself, and I jump into the car and do my preparation, but you don't know, in your career, where it's going to end up, because it also has to do with luck. I mean, I could have done the same steps I've done, you know, from Toro Rosso to here, but if the car is not competitive, then you're not winning races or championships. So it all needs to come together. For some people, it happens sooner. For some people later, or it never happens. That's also part of Formula 1. And I was well aware of that when you know I got into it. Because that's just how Formula 1 works. So yeah, of course, back then I wouldn't have imagined anything like this. Honestly, there is no need for me to comment on that here. I'll discuss it with him. It's definitely a bit more hit and miss. Because we went onto the slick tyres during Qualifying, and then you finally can start to pick up a bit what the car is actually doing. I think, luckily, it wasn't too bad. But yeah, I mean, honestly, with these kind of Sprint formats, when you have a FP1 like that, but even if it's like fully dry, it's still sometimes a bit hit and miss. And that makes it always very chaotic. That's why I never really enjoy these kinds of weekends, because you just don't have the time. And then once you do a mistake, you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend. And I don't think it should be like that. So for sure, you can do better things with the format. But I guess they implemented that for this particular reason that there's a bit more chaos and people not getting it right. But I don't think how advanced everything is in this sport that it should be like that: that on a Friday if you arrive with the wrong set-up, or you make the wrong call after FP1 that you're stuck with it for the rest of the weekend, which basically also happened for us in in Brazil last year. It's just super painful. I think it's important to try and win everywhere. For me, it would be weird if I want to win more here or in Zandvoort. I mean, it's nice and I really appreciate all the support I have, but I want to win on any track. Because that's my motivation all the time, I want to do the best I can. But, for sure you know, when you have all the fans around the track supporting you, it brings a big smile on my face and it makes the weekend a bit more enjoyable for sure.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, exactly. I mean, we've had quite a positive weekend on our side in terms of pace. Of course, the race went well on my side, but a shame for Carlos, as I think we had good pace. So that is good. When you look at the Red Bull, we still have a lot of work to do, especially in terms of race pace, because degradation and everything they are quite far ahead still. Yes, until I've been told to do some fuel saving. And this was quite big at the end of the race. So there I was struggling a bit more, but the pace was there to keep Lewis behind. And then I knew that he was going to pit for the fastest lap, which made my life a little bit easier. Well, actually, it's a brand from Monaco, and I'm very proud of wearing them so I always have them on me. err… yes! This was the best we could achieve today, no doubt. So yeah, you always hope to try to win the race, but on the other hand, realistically, we knew that both of the Red Bulls would be much quicker, and… yeah… but our target was to maximise the points with the package we had and honestly, I don’t think we could have done anything better today. It was good. It was good. Basically, we had to react to what Lewis was doing behind, which then the Red Bull had to react to us a lap later. So that’s why we were all on the same strategy, because everybody was reacting to somebody else’s strategy. So, yeah, our strategy was based on Lewis and trying to keep him behind during the whole race. He had a good pace but I felt we had him under control. A bit too much. But on the other hand, when Checo started to push again for a few laps at the end, I could not match that, so I think they also had a bit of margin. But yeah, at one point I was seeing that I was doing the same lap times as Checo, I didn’t know how much he was saving but I knew how much I was saving, so I thought, ‘OK, maybe we can get second place – but then very quickly I understood that he was just saving. It didn't go well. Before the first race, the target was to do a step better, compared to last year, which was to win the World Championship. If we look at the first half of the year, we are very far from where we put our expectations before the season. So, on the other hand, as soon as we understood that, we reset it and there was an incredible reaction from the team. They brought upgrades, sometimes a month and a half earlier, and this requires a lot of effort from everybody at Maranello. And this, we saw that, it helped us have great results. I think we still need to try to understand – because if I do a step back in the last two races, I think we expected to be much more competitive in Budapest than on a track like here and at the end, it’s the opposite. So, these are things that we need to look at because maybe we haven’t optimised the package in races like Budapest and maybe we’ve done something that was surprisingly good on a track like here. So, it’s good, anyway, to finish on a positive note the first part of the season and now we will take the time of the summer break – or at least whenever the guys can work again – to try to analyse those two last races and hopefully maximise the package at all races for the second half of the season. I think it's a bit too early to say but it's been two or three races where we are managing our tyres better. I think today, this was definitely not the reason why we finished so far behind the Red Bulls, I think they were just quicker. But in terms of tyre management, we didn't have a huge degradation. And also looking at Mercedes behind, I was in control of the pace of my tyres. So on that it looked good, we still need to keep an eye on that because sometimes, especially in very specific conditions, we sometimes get off the window of the tyres, the right window, and then we struggle quite a lot. No racing for me. Around Monaco, Corsica and Sardinia with my family and my friends.",Belgium,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was a good race for the team, we deserved it really well. We had a great start. So I managed to get through Charles, which was one of the targets of today. And yeah, from then on, I was just doing my own race and then Max came through in the second stint pretty fast. So nothing I could have done there. And then afterwards it was just about making sure we brought it home safely without too much damage on the car. Yeah, certainly. I really look forward to not leaving the podium anymore from now until the end of the year. It's been a bit of a rough patch, but I think we overcome and today we managed to score great points for the team. Yeah, definitely. I really need the summer break. It's been really intense the last few races, so I look forward to it and come back very strong for Zandvoort. I think just getting that form back. We were on the podium last weekend and now, and I think, having these sort of races in clean air, is where you learn a lot and you make those steps in the coming races, because my last few races have been a bit of… yeah, very hard to get a proper read on them, because the way you have to race with dirty air, and so on, so that to me I think is where we’re going to be learning the most on that stint on free air and the second stint as well. Yeah, I knew that it was quite crucial for my race to get Charles on lap one. We had a good launch but he also had a good start so it was just about making sure we got him into Turn Five. It worked well and we were able to do, basically, our own race from that point on. I think we managed to do a good first stint. Yeah. Certainly. I did struggle quite a bit on that Medium tyre, especially with the rain. Felt like I lost a bit of temperature on it. We never really got a good read on that tyre. I think it was pretty obvious, most of the field went back onto the Soft tyre and yeah, had a good moment into 11 when the race was very tricky, the conditions were very tricky at that point. Yeah, I think it doesn’t really matter. I think for us, it gives us a bit of time to go deep on our analysis, see what we can improve for the next ten races and, yeah, basically keep the momentum going for the end of the season. Yeah, I think I was quite surprised with it, given how short notice it was. I think Otmar is great, any person in that position, you’ve got to give them time. And I think Otmar lacked time to really show his potential, which I know is huge because I've seen what he's done in other teams with very limited budgets and with not so limited budgets as well. So I think that it's a shame that they let him move on but yeah, I think on the other hand, whoever comes needs to have proper time because all these things in Formula 1 takes a massive time. It was a joke. He came before qualifying and said ‘if you're not in the top three, I will not talk to you the rest of the weekend’. So he was talking to me the rest of the weekend. Training my skills in the golf cart, through the golf course. And yeah, I will disappear for a few weeks as well.",Belgium,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"It's a new spot, that's for sure – P6. Yeah, I mean, I knew that we had a great car. It was just about surviving Turn 1. I could see that it was all getting really tight. I've been in that position before as well, myself, so I was like, ‘I'm just going to stay out of that’, and it worked out and then from there onwards, I think yeah, we all made the right overtakes, moves. I just got a little bit stuck at the beginning and in a bit of a DRS train but once that cleared, I could do my own pace. And again, it's really enjoyable. I did slow down. Of course, you know, we all look at the numbers, we look at the wear of the tyre and you know, this track is super hard on the tyres, so you don't want to do any unnecessary things. So that's what we did till the end. Yeah, that's probably the worst corner to have a moment, but it was tricky in those laps when it was raining, because you could see that it was raining but not how much exactly and I had the little sideways moment. Luckily nothing happened but it's definitely a corner where you don't want it to happen. Yeah, lap one, Turn 1… My start was OK, but then I could see Carlos lock up, so you had to go to the inside. But then of course, Oscar was kind of there as well and then they both went deep into the corner. So I knew exactly what was going to happen, because I have had the same thing happen to me in 2016, I think it was or something. So it's like, ‘OK, I'm going to stay out of it, I go wide’. But then, of course, they had damage. And you have to wait and see what they're going to do on the exit, because I could see Oscar couldn't really steer anymore. So we lost a little bit of momentum there, but luckily, it was all OK. And of course, I also got Carlos into Les Combes. And yeah, from there onwards, basically, my race started. But I was a bit unlucky, because I got stuck behind Lewis, because he was in the DRS of Charles, and with them having the highest top speed, Lewis, this weekend, it was just impossible to pass. So I had to wait for him to drop out of the DRS and as soon as he didn't have DRS anymore, I could pass. And then I think two or three laps later, I could pass Charles. But with that, I think I hurt my tyres a bit too much. So basically, as soon as I had my stop on to the Medium, I could feel that the car was in a much better window and I could go a lot faster. So yeah, from there onwards that was really where it started to come alive. And really enjoyable to drive and once I got into the lead, also, I could really look after the tyres as well. But then, of course, the rain started to come down. So you had to slow down quite a bit in some places. And once that cleared, we went back to a Soft tyre set and, again, the car was well balanced. And it shows that, you know, once you're not in traffic, how much better you can be on tyres. So yeah, it was, again, a great race. There were a few unknowns. I think, also, the first stint [I had] probably a bit too much understeer in the car trying to follow. But honestly, if I would have to do it again, I wouldn't really change a lot on the car. So I guess we nailed it pretty much. I mean, you just have to wait and see what happens in front of you. I mean, once you're clear through lap one, then basically you can just settle in and work your way forward. Yeah, that’s probably not the best place to go sideways but luckily nothing happened. Of course, also, with the new, like the changes through there, you have a little bit more run-off, but it’s still not a nice corner to have a moment. A swear word. I don’t think it matters a lot, to be honest. I just want to have a nice time now. Have a bit of time with family and friends and we’ll go to Zandvoort. It’s a completely different track again to Spa but I’m expecting if we do a good job with the set-up, we will be quick. Yeah, the rain was just moving around on the track, like sometimes it was just increasing in other places, you know, from lap to lap. So, I just got up there and it probably rained a bit harder when I was on the other side of the track, in Eau Rouge, and I got there and it just caught me out. It was just a bit more slippery than I thought it would be. So yeah. I mean, it happens, you quickly try to correct it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Luckily, at that speed as well, you have quite a bit of downforce on the car. That helps. Yeah, it was not great. Yeah, we did have to save a bit but it’s always a combination of things throughout the race, what you’re saving. Probably 50-50 in the messages. I know that the team doesn't like to do another stop but I like to mention it so they might get a bit nervous. And then I like the response: ‘no, no, we're not doing that today’. It's fine. We know each other very well and we have a very good relationship. Yeah, I think it's very important, the relationship with your race engineer. I find it always a really important part of your performance, not only your race engineer but everyone very close around you, performance engineer, these kinds of things. And of course, over the years, you build up much more of a relationship, you know each other much better. So yeah, for sure, if he would be removed or whatever that's definitely not ideal at all. It's difficult to choose. There have been a lot of nice ones, some of it most straightforward. I think the one actually which I really enjoy was like back in time in Miami. It's a tough track, also to get through the field but we managed I think that whole race quite well after, of course, the tough qualifying. So probably for me, that was a very enjoyable one but honestly, also today, the last one in Hungary - there are a lot of nice ones. I think also throughout the first part of the season, we have improved as a team. And also from my side, I feel more comfortable in the car. And it's all about little details. So a lot of enjoyable moments. It's tough to pick one. A lot of cardio and a lot of wrist training. Not what you think it is. (Indicates tilting)",Belgium,post-race,Red Bull
Esteban Ocon,"Recovering, thank you. It's obviously been quite a short period between the incident and going back on track quite soon but I will be okay to race this weekend which is the most important and, yeah, ready to race. I don't think we can call it on luck for two instances. I think obviously we are not where we want to be exactly. We know what we have to do. We know where we have to progress and we are obviously bringing some new parts to the car this weekend. Hopefully, that's going to bring us closer to the top ten, to be able to score. But yes, it's going to be important for us to have a good one before the summer break so we can all go on the holidays with a clear mind. Feet on the ground at the moment, seeing what it's going to bring. Obviously it's going to be the important…  understanding it as well. It's going to be tricky with this format this weekend, especially how very few tyres we have on the wets or in general for the weekend. So yeah, just want to see if it brings us closer to the points so we are going to be able to score again. That's what we want to be achieving. I didn't test these tyres but listening to Kevin I think it also takes away some strategy games in the race because you cannot undercut people anymore. And  we've seen different categories trying it as well, on a damp track or something when you have to switch to two slicks. I just don't think it is the right thing to do with the technology we have at the moment. Obviously trusting Pirelli to do a good job with it but if you have a tyre that works at cold temperatures it will degrade massively. That is always the problem that you face with tyres. Yeah, I mean, a Sprint weekend is often a big challenge because we only have one session, first of all, to set up the car and get it ready for the rest of the weekend. So you can't really miss that session and make a mistake. It has happened to us in the past, in a past Sprint weekend, and we know how important it is. Obviously, if it's wet, we'll keep more tyres. And if we can't run, we'll keep more tyres for the rest of the weekend, which is not a bad thing in a way. But yeah, it will lead us to uncertainty. And obviously, we worked hard in the simulator to make sure we have a good setup and we're ready for the weekend, if that happens. So, in any case, you know, we are the most ready now we can be. It's easy to say that, for you, now. But, you know, we've been working very hard. So, obviously, we are not having the best couple of races. But, you know, when we've brought, you know, some good updates to the car we were fighting, you know, near the top five, we had a couple of Qualifyings where we were very well into the top 10. I finished on the podium in Monaco. You know, we qualified top five in Barcelona and Canada I was P6. It’s just recently that it hasn't gone our way. Other teams have improved more than we did. But it really shows how tight it is and how much, you know, bringing something to the next race can change things. And yeah, I mean, we've seen it with McLaren what happens. Obviously, I’m not saying that bringing an update, that that's what we are going to do, but we are keeping focusing on ourselves, trying to do the best we can and hopefully coming back in the point-scoring zone for this race. I think on paper it looks good. To have a Sprint race in Spa is more show. There are more long straights for overtaking. It’s good that we try it.",Belgium,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"No, not at all. It's just been super good. And everything's been fine. So I’m fresh as always and ready to go again. Well, I don't know. I think it's frustration. It's of course building when you see other teams developing and making big gains and we haven't seemed to make that big step yet. But I still have all the faith in the team that we can turn it around eventually.  It's not going to be immediate but I think we're doing the groundwork to be able to bring that step later on in the year. It's of course frustrating when you don't have it and we want to be up there scoring points and doing well and at the moment it's a bit hard. I think we have made some progress. It's just that overall our performances have dropped compared to our main competitors. But Qualifying versus Race, I think that that has improved. Unfortunately, some of the cars that we used to be racing in the beginning of the year have just become much faster overall and that's why we don't see that gain so much. But yeah, as I said, we're working super hard. The whole team is really working hard and I think there's still reason to be optimistic for the remaining of the year. We'll see when it happens and how that pans out. I think at the moment there's not any news to bring and eventually we'll come around to it. I don't really know what's going on. I feel like the team is pretty happy but you never know with these things and I'll take it one day at a time. I think… no blankets, I've done a test and it's okay. The tyres are what they are. When they're hot, it's okay, I guess but the warm-up phase and the out laps are going to be super tricky. I think in a race situation when you need a hurry-up on the out lap I don't think it's going to be that much fun. So unless they improve that I don't know if it's going to work Yeah, I mean, everything Esteban said and, you know, at the end of the day, it's going to be the same for everyone. If it's cancelled, it's cancelled, and we'll deal with it. I don't know. I mean, I don't really care where they are. I like the Sprint weekends. I think they offer more excitement, you know. There's more pressure in a bigger part of the weekend and I think that's good or more fun at least. Whether it should be at Spa or not, I don't know.",Belgium,thursday,Haas
Lewis Hamilton,"I think it leaves us optimistic. I think it was amazing to have that experience on Saturday. It shows that there's potential in the car and everyone's working incredibly hard to bring performance. And I think our race pace was very good, we just have to work on what was… we've understood what the issue was at the beginning and we've got some upgrades here this weekend. The weather's going to be interesting. Well, as a driver you're constantly battling the inconsistencies with balance but we are flat out trying to improve. Just as Kevin says, we're working a lot to analyse where we are and what we can do to try and make those big steps that some of the others potentially have, like McLaren and Red Bull often make so hopeful and I have all the faith in the world that we will eventually get there too. I think it's been decent. We didn't start where we wanted to be at the beginning of the year,  but we just made a lot of progress. It's been a huge amount of progress over the season so far, and hoping that there'll be a lot more in the second phase. To be fighting for a World Championship. That's always the expectation… No, it was just to be in a much better position than we were last year and I think that wasn't the case. With all the amazing work that goes on through winter, we kind of started further behind and so it's been a big, steep, uphill climb. But really proud of the team. We're fighting for second in the Constructors’ Championship which is definitely something we didn't expect after what we felt at the first test and that's really down to the great teamwork that's happening in the background. My full focus is on to try and secure second for the team. I think for everyone back in the factory it means a huge amount for them and whilst we can't currently catch the Red Bulls, I think  that puts us in a good position for next year. At the moment, I'm not quite sure we can currently compete with them on race pace. I think there were times in the last race Max was around eight tenths faster than everyone on a single lap. But never say never. What they’ve said, basically. I've already spoken about this so not really much more to add to it. I think it's been amazing so far. I think everyone's felt incredibly welcome and there's a great vibe within the filming crew, with the actors and directors, everyone's just feeling a lot of love and feeling included which I think has been great. I think it's been well received. And there's just so many people that have worked so hard to make it possible, with great help of Stefano, for example. This has never happened in our sport before. It's huge. So, hats off to the sport and to those that are running, that are showing that we are progressive, we're moving forwards in a new way. And fortunately for us, we're still able to do some of the filming with the stunt crew, but I don't think for anybody it has been helpful, but I stand with the actors. I know what they're fighting for and I hope they come to a resolution soon. It's not something I ever think of. I think as a driver, it's not something that you can ever really let into your mind. But I trust in what the FIA are doing. I don’t think we would be here if they didn't think that we'd be safe. And I believe that… Again, I trust in them, as they've done such incredible work over the past couple of decades. I trust in them to make the right decisions moving forwards also. I don’t even know what the question was. I mean, I love the track the way it is. I don't really know what to say. It's not my job to decide what needs to be changed or how it should be changed. That's why we have good people to be able to do that job. Same as Kevin. They both covered it. No. Yeah, really happy to hear of the progress being made. I think it's been great. Having Susie in there, who was a phenomenal driver, so has the perspective from a driver side, but also she's been a team owner. She's really fighting for that inclusivity. So I think it's really great the steps that were taken and really happy to hear that all of Formula 1 is on board.",Belgium,thursday,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"We've done a lot of races and practices, it's the same for everyone. So it doesn't change anything. But we've seen it before. The margins in Qualifying are very small so if you don't already get Q1 right, it could be very easily (be) out. We saw it last weekend, I think, with George, he was out in Q1 and Lewis was on pole. So it can just happen to anyone out there. I think so. I think with the new tyre, it's extremely close with everyone. And yeah, I see no reason why this should be any different. I think for the team it has been a great first half of the year. It will be great to keep it the same for that second half of the year. On my side, I think I had four or five weekends where I didn't maximise the full result that I had on the table and that has cost me a lot of points, but I had a very strong start to the season. And I just think on the second half of the year I just want to be bring my form back and be able to score as many points as possible in the coming races. It has changed a bit in that regard. I think when we went to Barcelona I found a bit of a different balance compared to what I wanted. But I think now we've come on top of that, we've made some good progress, we've had some good race pace in the last few races but qualifying hasn't been going on our way. So I think it's just how it is; through the year sometimes you'll have a bit of bad races, but it's important where we finish in Abu Dhabi, I think. Just a safety concern on the drivers. I've done the tests they did last year in Monza and I think the main concern is that out lap. It's just important to consider it, especially with the race conditions. Visibility can be really poor, so we are in the hands of a race director. Nothing we can do now so we will just fully trust him. I think last year, apart from Max, we didn't see much overtaking. I think Max had a very strong pace through the weekend. So I'll say that it's good. I think certainly after Monaco I lost some confidence, because the way that my crash happened, I did lose a bit of confidence with the car. And that put me back. I have my psychology, and that's something that I work on. And other than that, I think it's just how the sport is, you know. You have good moments, bad moments, but always when you are at Red Bull, the pressure is a lot higher in that regard. You have a bad session and then you have to answer questions about your future straightaway. So it's just how it is. But luckily enough, I'm in a good place and I just have to focus on making sure that I enjoy my job and enjoy the weekend. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've had that before. And it's just how it is, you know, we operate on such small details that sometimes if everything isn’t perfect, it can mean being on the podium or being out of the points, you know. But it's obviously something that people at home don't really understand, how much detail goes into our races, and that can make the difference between having a great race or having a very poor race. But it can happen to anyone, to any driver in Formula 1. Same as Lewis.",Belgium,thursday,Red Bull
Valtteri Bottas,"It definitely was a positive surprise. Of course we took that result happily on Saturday, but I think it was everything kind of came together. We had the upgrade in Silverstone. We learned a bit more about it in terms of the setup and then the track just suited our car pretty well, I think. Yeah, those type of corners that Budapest offers seem to work well for us. Unfortunately, in the race we were not quite on the same pace as in the qualifying, and yeah, I was a bit unlucky at the start as well. So no points, which is of course disappointing after that kind of Saturday. I would say all the twisty stuff, like all the low speed corners; the long corners it seemed good. And it feels like whenever there's more straight line it's a bit more of a struggle for our car at the moment. So let's see how we go here. I would definitely myself say on paper Budapest would be stronger for us than here but also now this weekend I think the weather is going to play a big part. It’s a Sprint weekend, there's going be opportunities so yeah, we still try and keep maximising everything with the new package and learning about the setup and hopefully squeezing a bit more out of it. Until this point of the season, we haven't met the targets we set as a team and everyone accepts it and is working as hard as ever to get back up there but it is the situation now.  We're not satisfied with it but it is motivating to see that even with small gains you can make good progress. So yeah, again, progress, improvements:  that's the key for the second half. I think everything has been covered except from my side, yeah, that the pressure rise is still an issue because obviously you still need to start with a certain minimum pressure. But once there's such a big difference in the temperature, obviously the pressure gets very high and that means you lose grip. Yeah, more degradation and if you're following another car, then it's even more worse. So there's still work to do, obviously, but the time will show. Similar thinking from my side. I think we rely obviously a lot on the FIA and decisions being made, whether it's about conditions and stuff but the track has been always the same. Some tracks are more dangerous than the others and especially if there's bit of weather added. But yeah, obviously visibility is a big one here if it's raining, but that's when someone else needs to control the drivers. Can they start the race or not? To make sure that nothing happens. I think it’s good. I wouldn't really change it. I think still you need a decent difference in the car pace to make a move. It's not like it's still easy to overtake. Same.",Belgium,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Alex Albon,"I think we have a good chance. I think car-wise we are in a good place. I feel like the last few races we've been able to get comfortable with the new upgrades. And, you know, Hungary was a circuit that shouldn't normally suit us and we finished P11. So, feeling positive going into this weekend. But with the rain, I think there's a little bit of a doubt over your performance, it becomes, not random, but a little bit more random. So let's see. I feel like it goes hand-in-hand. Of course, when the car gets quicker as well and you're fighting for points, people talk about it a little bit more. I think we're doing a great job, I feel, as a team.  Driving-wise as well. I'm feeling comfortable and confident in the car, which is always important. And it's just great going to every race weekend being able to fight for points, and being in that area where you feel like you go to every weekend knowing that, it just builds confidence and motivation for everyone in the in the team. So yeah, I would say we're enjoying these moments, and hopefully we can we can score some more points. Yeah, honestly, I have to say it's been a really good year for us so far. Don't want say too much. But it feels like the way that we started in Bahrain and where we are right now, we've made great progress. Maybe not as much as the McLarens, but on our side, we are heading in the right direction. And as I said… I don't know where we are, I think we are seventh right now, in the Constructors’, tied. If you had told me that at the start of the year, I think if you had told anyone from the team that at the start of the year, we would have bitten your arm off. So it is going well. Obviously, we just need to stay focused and keep going at it. But I'm sure, as a team, we can take the summer break off and enjoy it and come back refreshed. No I don't think so. I think actually, if you look at the overtaking this year, we've had less than less. I know there's… maybe other drivers don’t agree but I think… I mean, if you want the exciting overtaking, the side-by-side overtaking if that's what you're talking about, we’re kind of at the limit now, I think. Someone like Max overtaking is just because he qualified out-of-position – but he should never have needed to overtake those cars in the first place: he would have been up at the front anyway. So unfortunately, it's more I think about the grid getting closer and closer, if you want it in that sense. I would almost say the focus should be on making… well, the cars are closing up now, that’s a great thing, and once the cars start to close-up, and more and more happens every year, then we might actually need to consider making the DRS zones even bigger, to then start to promote overtaking again – because I think it’s getting quite tough now to overtake cars. I think it’s getting harder and harder.",Belgium,thursday,Williams
Lando Norris,"I want to say the same. Spa is one of my favourite circuits of the season. [We have] conditions, which generally, we perform pretty well in, so there's no reason why we shouldn't continue where we've been. Yeah, I guess it’s another challenge for us in terms of circuit and layout and another opportunity for us to see where the car really stands. But the team have been doing a great job. I think we've been doing a great job with strategy and everything else we can do. So yeah, another weekend we can look forward to, to try and achieve similar things. It's very tough to say. I mean, we'll see what the conditions are going to do first of all. Yeah, I think a couple years ago things were going very well in the wet until it all went horribly wrong. But the car is competitive, you know. We've clearly made a big, big step. Fighting cars we weren't expecting to… Being ahead of cars we weren't expecting to be ahead of and fighting for podiums, fighting for pole position. So, I'm not going to say no to the question, but it could be a trickier weekend than the last few. No. It's a no. I don't think it is. It's a fact, it's not a second. I think that the biggest thing is a lot of other teams that were competitive and start aren't as competitive now. If you look at Aston Martin, if you look at Ferrari, they were a lot closer to the front than they are now and we just seem to have swapped positions for some reason. I don’t know if they've taken a step back or Red Bull have taken a step forward or what, but, yeah, we weren't expecting at all to… We were expecting the upgrade to help us race against them and so far, at a lot of these races, we've been ahead of them. It's definitely not one second. I think some of these tracks that we've been to, we've performed well at in the past, you know. Silverstone I was already P4 last year. Budapest already last year, we were P5 or P6 or something. They’re tracks we have performed well at in the past and now we've just taken another step forward. But like I said, there's some tracks that I know we're not going to be as competitive at and then it's not going to look like we made a one-second step forward. So yeah, we'll see. But the team have obviously done an extremely good job, and we're continuing to try to make another step. I mean, my honest answer is it's not a lot different. It's just quicker. Nope. No. But it doesn't matter, we're still fighting for podiums and it's a lot quicker. So that's all I ask for, in a way. The car is still difficult to drive, it's difficult to be consistent. I think we still need to do a better job with tyre management and so on. I think that was clear from last weekend. It was one of our weaker areas. But I think we can be more than happy with the step forward that we've made. I don't think… as much as I'm always going to complain about certain things, because that's what every driver does but for us to get from where we were, struggling to get out of Q1 in the first few races, to be fighting for pole I would say it's one of the biggest turnarounds in Formula 1 for a very long time. And during the middle of middle of a season as well, so I'm very happy. There's always things to improve on and that's what we're trying to do. I knew you’d bring it up. I mean, first of all, I do want to apologise for it: I obviously had no intention in ever doing such a thing. And I know how much it means to the Hungarians and part of their culture and so forth. So yeah, like, of course, I want to enjoy the time, it was never my intention to do such thing. And I did apologise to Max.  I know, I obviously made a couple of jokes about it. Which maybe I shouldn't, but I do feel bad for… if he did it to my trophy, I'd be annoyed, so I do apologise for it. And obviously the people who put the time and effort in and everything into making it, I really didn't mean for it to happen. So, I'll make sure I'm a lot more careful next time on, on celebrating. That’s all I’d say. I wouldn't say… no, there's no reason why I should. I'll just take a little bit more care with obviously what I do. But yeah, I’ll just move the trophies aside and then continue. I think when you're behind the Williams, they should make the DRS a lot bigger everywhere! I think it's tough. The competition is getting closer, so the closer the cars, the harder to overtake. I don't think you can use a Red Bull or Max as an example. I think that's…  you just can't. Even if they started last in every race, they’re going to come through, no matter if there's the DRS or not. But I think the racing for the middle of the pack and so on is good. I think it’s exciting, I would say it's going to get less and less. The more technical the cars get, generally, the worse the racing gets, even from this year to last year, the racing, I would say, is more difficult and worse than what it was just because the cars are evolving quite a bit. So yeah, two reasons why it's getting trickier. And I think the answer is yes, we need DRS. Otherwise, you're not going to want to watch the TV at all.",Belgium,thursday,McLaren
Yuki Tsunoda,"I think it's good. Learning lots of things from him already. So it's fun to do a couple of filming with him on a Thursday. Thursday became slightly more fun I think for the content, but other than that's not much difference. Yeah it's good. I think it's similar. In the end what I'm saying and what Daniel is saying is quite similar. Obviously we just had one race and Hungary is a little bit different so it’s difficult to say. But so far it’s not much difference. Hungary, yes. Unfortunately, I smashed my front wing in FP1. It's my fault. But rear wing we definitely made a step. To be honest I don't know [about the] new upgrade to the front wing I've because sadly it's gone in FP1 for me. But I think other than just we made a step with the rear wing. I think performance was pretty good in terms of car in Hungary but I just couldn't put it all together from my side. We made a bit of a step, but probably not as much as still we want, and I think Hungary is more towards more slow-speed corners where still you know, mechanical grip is required, which we are quite good at, like we saw in Azerbaijan, but I think still overall package we are still missing performance, a little bit, compared to where we want to. Yeah I would say so. I was happy with the performance the first couple of races. Last three races it’s been a little bit messy, myself. Yeah, still there's a couple of limitations like in the radio, where I want to focus and improve. Sometimes I rush to, kind of, overperform, you know, to be into Q3, Q2, whatever and sometimes mistakes started to happen more consistently rather than first couple of races. First couple of races, just discover how the car performance is, just see how it goes and not really rush to. We started to like, you know [inaudible] performance or like we're slightly towards the back now compared to the first few races and rushed into like score points. But, you know, that kinds of rushing makes more consistent mistakes. So I just have to reset myself and yeah, just try to focus on what I can do. But I’m still happy with my progress, what I had in this year compared to last year so yeah, it's good. And I think Daniel gives more information and more, I think, places that I have to improve, so yeah, I'm looking forward to it.",Belgium,thursday,RB
Charles Leclerc,"I'm trying to do my best every single race weekend, then of course, it's always special to come back to the place where you've won your first race. It was a very,  I mean it is, a very special memory for me. It was a very special moment at the time, even though it was done in circumstances that was difficult to obviously enjoy the moment as we had lost Anthoine the day before, but it's a special track, I think every driver really enjoys this track, and we can always expect some exciting weather and this weekend it looks like it’s going to be a pretty wet the whole weekend. So hopefully we'll be competitive in those conditions. Honestly, I think we've been quite good whenever it was full wet, or full dry. Or, at least we were maximising our package. I struggled personally a bit more in the half-wet, half-dry conditions. But we put quite a bit of work into it so I'm confident that if we find ourselves in those situations again, I'll be back at the level I want to be. Well, first of all teams are super close now, especially in Qualifying. You look at the Budapest Qualifying and we all we were all within seven-eight hundredths in Q3 apart from the top three but, where I was, everybody was so close. So, the smallest difference can have a big influence on your results. And, at the moment, that's where we are as a car. Then, I think as a team at the track, we need to focus on every single detail because, now more than ever, it makes a big influence on your end results – in Qualifying especially. And in Budapest, we probably left a bit of performance here and there, which had a big consequence on our weekend. Then, the big picture is that we aren’t fast enough. And this, we know it, and we are putting in all the effort to be back at where we want to be as quickly as possible. Yes, I think there are some changes that could make a difference. First of all, it's the walls in the straights after Eau Rouge I think could be… we should have a bit more space on the left and right where, if you lose control of the car, I think the way it is done at the moment, you are bouncing on the walls, and you have very high chances of finding yourself in the way again, and I think this is probably a change that we should consider in the future. Then to change the layout of Eau Rouge, by example, I think we find ourselves in the season in those particular conditions being fast in a  straight, that’s basically everywhere. And I think that's going to be difficult to do anything else, other than that. You  can always change the layout but I don't think it's fair to say that this is what should be done. Then the two biggest problems after that is visibility. Visibility is… it’s really difficult to put into words what we are seeing, apart from saying that we are seeing nothing. But we are not exaggerating, when we say we don't see anything: we really don't see anything when it's raining. And this is a really big problem for Formula 1, for motor sport in general, any single-seaters. Now, we have quite a bit of downforce, there’s quite a lot of spray. And then this causes quite a lot of incidents, just because we cannot react to what there is in front. So easy to say that, much more difficult to find a solution for that. But I know that the FIA is on it, and is obviously trying to do the best on that. And then, the last thing is when can we actually… when is it safe to start a race, and this is another topic for the FIA to look closely, especially on a weekend like this, where seems we will have quite a lot of rain throughout the whole weekend, to not feel the pressure of starting a race just because we didn't have any running. We could be in that situation this weekend. But at the end, obvious to say, but safety comes first. And this needs to be the priority and people, and first of all, us drivers, we shouldn't complain if we don't have any laps because it is not safe to do so, with everything that has happened. I mean, if I'm looking only at myself, we did some progress, but definitely not enough when you're looking at the others. Last year, at this point, the target was to win races now. We are closer, much closer to the other teams and Red Bull is much further away now. So yeah, the progress we have done is definitely not enough. We are aware of it. But yes, with Fred, we are also speaking a lot. He shares his view of what we should do in the future, what are the plans for the future, and this gives me the confidence that we are going in the right direction. Then to tell you exactly when we'll be in that position, again, to be fighting in the front is very difficult. But I know that the plan is there and that… yeah… and I am really confident that it's going to make a difference. Well, I think a realistic target, first of all, should be to try and be second in the Constructors’, which is going to be a challenge. McLaren now is back in the fight; Mercedes is always strong. Aston Martin a bit less recently, but I have no doubt that they will come back. So yeah, this is this is our target. We have few upgrades coming a bit later on in the second part of the season, which hopefully will make a difference and will help us achieve these targets. He's adapting really well. I mean, Ferrari is definitely a different beast to Alfa Romeo: many more people involved; a lot more pressure. But Fred straightaway understood what were the areas where we should work on and, yes, he definitely makes a difference in a way that he's obviously working. I mean, everybody has his own way of working. I know Fred will work really well, because we worked together in the junior categories, in Alfa Romeo, and he's slowly implementing these new mindsets, which I think is positive and will make a difference in the medium-long term. But it's also his first season within the team, so we need to give him time in order to see these changes take form on track.",Belgium,thursday,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, we got close to P2. Unfortunately, we to a lot of backmarkers. The track was unbelievably dirty off-line, so in the last laps I had some pick-up going through the backmarkers and then yeah, that meant I lost a few seconds, and then I recovered towards the end but it was just too late – but anyway, I think overall it was a great strategy by the team and we managed to have an excellent result. Yeah, definitely. I think this sort of performance, sort of days, do help. From now on I just look forward to basically be on the podium every single weekend. So, yeah, let’s keep it up. Yeah, it was, because we were on very similar age tyres, basically we pitted at the same lap. So we were on fresh tyres, I went for it around the outside. We touched into T1 and then into T2 we touched again. So it was a little bit close but hard racing, I would say. It was good. But very tough, especially starting on the Hard compound. It felt very low grip initially. But just to follow around and to overtake, you know, there were times where basically we just had one line because offline was a lot of rubber and we were damaging a lot the tyres. So it was not easy to overtake out there today. As usual, you know, it's a track that is very difficult to overtake at. But I think we might we managed to execute a good strategy. Basically, just to maximise it, try to try to get the biggest amount of points possible. I was looking forward to getting onto the podium. So I knew that I had to do some overtaking there. It was quite difficult because we were going through the back markers, Lando and myself. I was chasing Lando. But yeah, going offline, I had like two very bad laps just cleaning up my tyres. And it was when Lewis was coming up, but luckily, they cleaned up and I think towards the end I had him under control. We were doing sort of similar [times] or a few tenths off, but not enough to be overtaken, so it was good. Unfortunately, at the end, we pitted on the same lap as Piastri, so I think I had to use my tyres a lot harder than I wanted to. I think we saw yesterday that the gap over one lap is very small. It was like five tenths between the top 10, so it was super small. But hopefully we are able to see the real pace of the car in Belgium, which should suit the car a bit better. So we'll see there. Average, no, for Max? I think from where they were in Bahrain or not even in Bahrain before Silverstone, the step that they made these last two races on very different tracks layouts, I think it's impressive. And I do expect to see Lando a lot more up here. So yeah, they've done an incredible job. High number. Yeah, certainly they do love racing and they're all over the city, not just at the circuit, they're back at the hotels. They really make a massive effort. They really follow the sport and it's great to have these sort of venues, that people you see that they really enjoy. And I think the circuit itself is so technical. For me, it's my highlight. I've never been on the podium here so it's my first time on the podium so I'm happy that it stays here.",Hungary,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Thanks, yeah. Thank you. I know, I know. I’ve got good fans. Thank you very much. Tough race. Not an easy one, especially with Checo catching at the end, but yeah, he didn’t have enough pace to catch up so I’m happy. I had to fight for a little bit in the beginning, I got a little screwed-over in Turn 1 but another podium for us, for McLaren, it’s amazing. If Max retires, or something, then maybe. At the minute, the guys are too quick. Unless they make mistakes or something happens… but at the moment, I think we’re very happy with the progress we’ve made, to go from where we were four, five races ago, struggling to get out of Q1 sometimes, to fighting for poles, and fighting for podiums, we’ll take it for now, and our time will come later on in the year. Just the obvious answer: a lot of hard work; great teamwork; everyone back in the factory did an amazing job. I think we knew it in the beginning: we were going to struggle and we looked pretty poor. We got a lot of abuse for McLaren, saying we weren’t doing a good-enough job. I’m happy we finally proved some people wrong. I’m not sure. Yeah. I’m not sure. Max just placed it too close to the edge! Yeah, just hold it. I don’t know. It fell over, I guess. Not my problem. It’s his! It’s very different. I guess we’re very happy because it’s my first time I’ve had consecutive podiums. To be P2, I guess is a fantastic result in a car that probably shouldn’t be P2 – but I don’t know, I guess it’s not my race. I don’t have the fans there – but the fans here were also pretty good, also there’s all the papaya fans dressed in papaya here, supporting us as usual. Well, when they’re shouting ‘Lando’ I think it makes sense! Yeah, it’s great. I’m just enjoying every podium. It’s still… I don’t quite have, what, 44? Is it 44 podiums or 44 wins? Damn! OK. Shit! I’ve got a long way to go. They’re all still fresh for me, and my trainer is still learning how to bring me a fresh set of clothes, and things like that. So yes, I’m still enjoying all of them. It’s not quite Silverstone – I don't think anything ever quite will be Silverstone – but it’s another podium in a place we probably weren’t expecting a podium, which probably makes it even more special again. Yeah. I don't know, sometimes you win on it and sometimes you lose. I guess I had a decent start. I kind of went with Max and Lewis and I couldn't go to the right, I had a big slipstream, so I came pretty much halfway alongside Lewis. It was tough to know what to do. If I brake early, then it's easy for the people to go up the inside of me. I just kind of had to brake where I wanted to brake, and I tried to turn in, but every time I tried to turn in, Max was trying to turn in, or sorry, Lewis was trying to turn in and I got caught out, simple as that. But it happens and obviously Oscar got through, which was great. And Lewis stayed ahead, which was frustrating, but then I managed to stay on the outside. I was a bit surprised, because I would have thought he'd run me a bit wider but he didn't. So it was close. I'm sure he was still trying but it's very easy to lock up into Turn 2, so even going into the corner I went back of a couple clicks on brake balance just to attack a little bit more. And it worked out. So I think that saved our race today. I don't think… If I didn't get past Lewis there, I don’t think I would have overtaken him today because their race pace was very strong. Their general pace was very strong. I just think they didn't execute a very good race and that overtake made me get a podium. That's tough to say. I think between us and Mercedes we’re pretty tied. If you look at tyre degradation, Mercedes are way, way better than we are. Always have been. Mercedes have always been very, very strong with tyre deg. If you look at yesterday, the Mercedes was quite a bit quicker with Lewis, so I'm going to be the guy that says, no. And I believe that Mercedes are very close, but it's tight. I think, like I said, if Lewis stayed ahead in Turn 2 they would have beaten us today and I probably wouldn’t be on the podium at all. And then you'd be saying, ‘ah, Mercedes are quicker’, but just because I overtook him you think McLaren are quicker. So, it's tight. They're doing a good job. But also McLaren. I'm very happy with them. They've done an excellent job. I would say so. Genuinely I don't think we expected to be here this weekend, especially in P2. Both Red Bulls are way quicker. So the expectation to be ahead of them is, like, basically a zero straight away. Mercedes were on pole here last year, and their car has been pretty good. I know Lewis complains a lot of how amazing our car is and how bad theirs is, but they don't have a bad car. And they haven't all season… I know. And we're just… I don't know if he said it.. And then I get to the slow-speed and it’s terrible. But yeah, like, I don't know what the question is, you’ve ruined the whole thing, mate. The expectation was not to be on the podium. I guess it's a lower-speed circuit, there's no super high-speed. You have Turn 4 and Turn 11, which are pretty high speed, but compared to Silverstone, it's not like an eighth-gear, flat out, Copse, Stowe kind of corner. So we just lowered the expectation. We didn't expect to be quite as good. But actually, this tarmac provides good grip, and that's a good thing for us. A hot day like today made things even harder than they would have been. I think Friday, the long run pace was very competitive. Today, we struggled more than we would have liked. But we know this is an area for improvement. So yeah, I think it's a positive surprise, again, to be where we are. But we have the same pace as Mercedes, it's just we've done a better job. So I have to thank the whole team for that. One-handed. Blindfolded as well. I don’t need it. It doesn’t do anything! Yeah, three races now with this upgrade package all of which we see clearly been a lot more positive. It is two things. One, it's just more load, just more grip.  I go round the corners a bit quicker. While doing that, I guess we've tried to improve some of the handling balance issues that we have, which I guess is another part of it. You don't just want a car which has got a lot of downforce but drives terribly. You need a car which drives  well and also has a lot of downforce. We've improved the load side and the downforce and we've improved ever so slightly the handling and with both of them, we've had a good improvement in tyre degradation at the same time. Of course, I would just say let's do another step. Simple as that. But I think there are still some things from a handling side of it that I would like to be improved. But it's tough.  You're always going to be complaining, which is the thing, like Max was complaining yesterday. I’ve never seen him complain so much. Today, it's mega. It comes and goes in little things but even if your car is a lot quicker, you're still going to have some issues here and there. So it's a combination of targeting slow speed corners and load, at the same time handling. If we can improve both of these together, that's already pretty the biggest step we need and we'll probably take away any weaknesses we have and then we'll just be strong and it'll be trying to raise the bar from that side of it. So I think we have a clear plan of action for how to do it and what we need. But actually turning it into something real is the difficulty. The guys are doing a very good job. Everyone in the factory is working extremely hard.  Days like today motivate them even more and make them work even harder, which is a good bonus. I would say so. I think my general pace and ability to put laps together and things like this has improved, not as much as I would like.  Again, like I said an interview the other day, the car still doesn't handle anywhere like what I would want from a car.  If you said what do you need from a perfect car, I feel like it's really far away from what I want. But it’s head is a little bit in that direction, which is a good thing for me, it’s how I want to be able to drive and push the car. But it has improved my confidence, I guess. We had a car which was inconsistent and I didn't know even last year at times, even last year when we looked good and I looked confident maybe.  There's still plenty of times last year when I had no idea how to drive the car.  I would come in and they would say what's the problem. From one lap to another it just changes and I don't know how to improve and so on. And now I feel like it's a slightly clearer direction that I need to be working in which is a good thing. I can just focus on more simple things with my driving and little things like this help be here today. So it improved my confidence quite a bit, not to the level that I still want but to go out and drive how I want and feel confident and just drive freely and not have to think about it too much. It makes a big difference, the more like for me.  Maybe it's my how my brain works but the more I think the worst I do. And I haven't seen every way of life that way. So the more I think the worse I do and now I have to think less which is a good thing. I can answer that one for them. Their tyres were mega and they got newer through the stint. You don’t even ask Red Bull guys how the tyres are;  their tyres are just fine. My Plan A and Plan C 20?  Master Yeah, there was a Plan F in there. I don't know, I'm not going to tell you. It was just different strategies I guess. And yeah, I guess we had to make a decision if you wanted to use a hard tyre or medium tyre. Maybe that clears it up. Maybe you can put it together then. But it was just trying to decide would we have done another hard tyre but the hard tyres didn't look incredible and the speed on the medium was quite a bit stronger. So we went obviously for medium in the end as well. So that was the reasoning for it, yeah. I’ll rate Max,  Max can rate Checo. You weren’t on pole yesterday, so I'll give you a seven. That let down… five. I mean, you're 4.4 No, I think obviously it’s clear. He’s 9.69 for Max. It wasn’t. I know. Yesterday, Lewis complained of how tough it was finishing outside first position. Not a lot more to add. Highlight is probably today. I've always enjoyed this track. Same thing: I drove here in Formula Renault, in 2016/2015 already so I've been coming here for a long time. We did many tests here. It's quite a common track. It's challenging. It's got its punishments, but I enjoyed, especially when it's a day like today, so I'm happy it's staying on the calendar. And like we saw the fans outside, it's not often you get the passion from it and they're very passionate and they travel from all over the world to come here. But the Hungarians and everyone that stays here and lives here also love racing. So that's always an extra bonus on the whole weekend.",Hungary,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, finally we had a really good start, so very happy with that, we’ve been working on that quite a bit to try really get the good bite. And then I knew, of course, that when I had the inside, that corner was mine. [Watches replay] It’s close! Yeah, it was just late on the brakes, you know, a heavy car. Luckily, it all worked out well. And basically, from there onwards I could do my race and today the car was really, really quick. Yeah, I think over one lap this weekend it was a bit of a struggle but maybe it was probably a good thing for today. So yeah, the car was good on any tyre. We could look after the tyre wear and basically that’s why we could create such a big gap. You have done this! For the team, 12 wins in a row is just incredible. What we’ve been going through the last three years is just unbelievable, and hopefully we can keep this momentum going for a long time, and also just to work with the whole team, it’s always very enjoyable. It’s always good to look into… like yesterday, for example, to keep pushing, always wanting to do better – but then a day like today, is just perfect. Yeah, I think it was a pretty perfect day. It already started with the actual start, where we had a good launch, for once, and yeah, we then could look after our tyres quite well, and every stint just eked out a bit more of a gap, and the car was honestly really enjoyable to drive today, so basically, with the balance I had yesterday actually worked very well for today. Of course, it’s really enjoyable to work with the whole team and to have this kind of success. I think people probably forget how tough it is to win 12 in a row. Even when you have the fastest car. It’s easy to make mistakes – or have an off weekend – but I think so far, of course, there were weekends when the gap was probably a bit smaller than we would have liked, but then also we had a few weekends where we also surprised ourselves and had a really good race, for example. So, yeah, I hope that we can just keep that momentum going, keep on trying to learn from the car, from the upgrades we’re bringing to the car, towards the end of the season, and also going into next year. They are very rare, days like this, I think, that it’s that good. I think last year, Spa, for example, was probably pretty similar – but then of course I had to start from the back, so yeah, very rare. Normally, it’s not that easy or straightforward. Hopefully, I don’t stay on 44. That would be terrible. Yeah, I need to get 45 quickly. Yeah, I think as soon as I released the clutch, immediately I felt like I had good bite, no wheelspin like in Silverstone. Good run, then I knew of course I had the inside and that was going to be my corner in Turn 1. We braked quite late but then yeah, did my thing through Turn 2 as well, and from then onwards, I could just build up the pace slowly. I’m going to take it off next time. I struggle to understand what papaya colour is… You were so quick in high speed. You were flat in Qualifying in Turn 4. I think in 11, if I would drive that car I couldn't hold my neck straight. So fast! Sorry! You will fly in Spa. Everyone should go and stand in Pouhon, because you will be flat. Take your rear wing off. We tried a few different things with the car in terms of set-up in Qualifying, which probably worked very well for today. But I mean, we tried so many things throughout the whole weekend, and it never worked on one lap. So it might have also been that we just didn't make our tyres work well over one lap. Because you know, in the race, everything heats up and it runs hotter for a long period of time. So yeah, you need probably very different balance for that and basically yesterday it was understeering a lot today it's warmer, ambient and track, so probably it all came to me anyway. And that's why I probably had such a nice balance today. Plan F? Copy. Yeah. You have those days where everything is just… you can put any tyre on.  Could have put a soft on as well at the end, it would have been fine. I was expecting 6.9. I don't like to give out numbers because you never do justice to it. I hate it. I really hated it at school. Letters you could also have, right.  You got A, B, C. Never really had a lot of As at school. I think as a team in general, to have won all the race so far has been good. We’re first and second in the championship so it's been good. It doesn't matter if it's perfect. It's never perfect but if it's really good, it's fine. We just need to keep on working. Sometimes you have a few tough moments where you make mistakes, you learn from them, you become a better driver and you move on. That's how it goes. Some things are also out of your control. Honestly, I felt sorry for you the first few races, because that was really not lovely, to drive. First of all, I think it's quite incredible to see where they were in Bahrain and where they are now, McLaren. But I think Lando has done extremely well. But this is also not a surprise to me. It's just good to see finally that when you have a competent car that you can do a good job and he's here in P2, twice. It doesn't need a number even. Yeah, I think that's great. I love driving here. It's a very technical track. I remember before I even started F3 and I came here testing in Formula Renault, I think it was at the time, and it was a very difficult track to learn at the time, to get it right. And I still come here driving GT cars, for example. It's just a lot of fun. It's not the biggest track but it feels like you're driving a big go-kart around basically. It's a lot of fun. So it's good that it stays on the calendar and it's close to Budapest which is a fun city as well. So it's great.",Hungary,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"A little bit. I’m disappointed, I guess. If you’re doing within a tenth of pole, it feels like you should be on pole if you put the lap together, you know? So, I guess as an overall picture, the team did a good job: P3 and P4 for both of us. So, a good weekend so far but, as a driver, I’m not the happiest. I feel like I made too many mistakes and that cost me today. There’s always little things. Just putting the lap together. It wasn’t the cleanest. I guess there’s always an element of risk involved in trying to push it a little bit more – but nothing major. I don’t know how much it was between me and P1 but if it’s a tenth, there’s definitely a tenth in it. So, frustrating but I’m happy. P3 is still a good position for tomorrow. So, still a good day. I’m good, I’m excited. I think the race pace yesterday, on Friday was pretty strong. Just as strong as we were in Silverstone, so I’m excited. Just a difficult track to overtake – which is probably why I’m a bit more frustrated that I normally would be – but I’m up there with the good guys. We’ve got two cars up there, so hopefully we can use them and get some good points tomorrow. Well, that’s an issue for tomorrow. We did a good job today, that’s all I care about. Tonight we focus for tomorrow. Good. Yeah, I think the balance all the way through… I think the one we struggled with most was probably the Hard tyre in the beginning. But the Medium and the Soft, I was pretty happy with. Just nine hundredths, you know. It wasn't like it was a bad session, just probably when you're under a tenth of pole, or eight hundredths off pole, you feel like that was within your driving, you know. If you just did something slightly differently, or just got on throttle a little bit earlier, like eight hundredths, you feel like is in it. So I guess that’s a little bit frustrating, especially to be so close. But, at the same time, P3. We're also happy. I mean, I guess like Lewis said, he's been struggling, but if you look at where we've been in the last few years, I think we’re even happier. And we've gone through an even tougher time, you know. We were fighting for 18th, 19th, 20th for the last year and in certain times. So, for us to be consistent now three races in a row, competitive, and to be so close to pole position is still a very good sign for us. So I'm happy, like mixed. I guess I'm happy, but also frustrated to miss out on what could have been an even better position. I have been. I think the thing is that everyone says Budapest is a slow-speed circuit. But really I’d say it's a lot closer to medium speed. You never even use second gear around the whole circuit. The slower speed is where we struggle. so where we’re the worst, you know, is in the chicane and Turn 1 and Turn 10, sorry Turn 12. That’s where we lose a lot of our time, but definitely close, to be only eight hundredths off pole position. I think we're pretty happy with that. A little bit surprised, but at the same time I think it's a good surprise. No, no, definitely not. Like I said, it's a medium-speed circuit. It's not a slow-speed circuit. So yeah, I think, again, we’re just happy with where we are. I’m very proud of the team and the progress we made. I think like Zak said we weren't expecting… We knew that the upgrade was a step but to be, consistently, three races on the trot in this position, sitting here now quite often, I'll make the most of it because I don’t know how long it's going to last. But yeah, I think it's still clear that we’ve got some weaknesses and those weaknesses are going to show in certain places, even in Spa we're going to struggle in certain places even more, like Turn 1. I'm already scared of Turn 1 in Spa. But yeah, there's many other things which are obviously very positive and if we're still here and under a tenth off pole position. I'm happy, the team are doing a great job. I'm very proud of the progress we’ve made. So, happy. I guess surprised to be in P3, but a good surprise, especially with Oscar in P4. Yeah, I mean, Bottas isn't behind me at the minute so that's a good start. But we'll see. It's going to be tough. Lewis, I think, is one of the best… Mercedes are very good starters, Lewis included. So to get them off the line is going to be a challenge. I think they're consistently one of the best starters on the grid. So to get the jump on him, it's going to be difficult. If Max can do what he did in Silverstone, it'll be wonderful. It changes every weekend. I just need to focus on getting a good start myself, focus on my own job and we'll see from there. I don't think I need to add any more. I think we were lucky it rained on Friday, otherwise pretty much no one would have gone out and done many laps, so I think we saw the best version of what it can be. Also, the most simplistic, because it’s quite confusing how things could work out, you know. You don't have to use the tyres, you can save certain ones. So, there's certain rules that we keep in place that kind of make it more simple for the fans to see. Like, this confuses me sometimes, with how it is. I don't know. I think like Max said, the Alfa Romeo was very quick all weekend, since FP1 they were very fast. So, I think it would have been an exciting Qualifying either way. I had to get my lap in, it was like a race out there. Sometimes you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do like I had to get a lap in. Everyone leaves such big gaps. I started my lap two seconds behind George and I was good enough for like a P8 or something. And that was on my second lap on the tyre. People just try and leave such big gaps. At some point they screw themselves over and cause themselves a problem. I made the most of it today, and did what I had to do to get my lap in. It is, it is.",Hungary,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Not much happened. I’ve been struggling that whole weekend to find a good balance. Every session has been up and down. Today also in Qualifying, really difficult, Q1, Q2, to just feel confident to really attack corners. I thought my first run in Q3 was quite good, then second run, again, no feeling. You try to push a little bit more, you lose the rear, lose the front, so I think… I mean it was still second, but I think we should be ahead with the car we have normally but so far this weekend, I think we haven’t been on it. Depends a bit on the temperature. I mean, it’s going to be quite hot, so normally rear tyres are always going to be quite difficult. I think for the race everything settles down a bit more – but I would have just hoped to have a little bit more of a fun balance in Qualifying to really attack it. I think the update works but I think we just didn’t put everything together set-up-wise. Because I think today it’s just been all over the shop, and not exactly where we want it to be. Terrible! I mean, it doesn't matter where you are on the grid. If it doesn't feel good, it doesn't feel good. And the whole qualifying I've been struggling a lot. Well, the whole weekend really, with a shift in balance, with understeer and you try to correct it and it's oversteer, and it was just never in a good window. So I was struggling a lot in Q1, Q2. I mean, there's not much you can do really once you go into Qualifying. But yeah, every time I got to the apex of the corner, it was just not gripping up for me. And that's probably the worst balance I can have in a car. And yeah, I tried to correct a few things in Q3, but there's only so much you can do and I thought my first lap wasn’t too bad but it still felt like I was driving on ice, with the front axle. Just very peaky. Then on the second lap, already, the first sector was just, again, off. Then, I just raced a bit more in Sector 2, which paid off, but in the last sector, I again lost the front and yeah, just really inconsistent and difficult to be progressive through qualifying. It was just hit and miss all the time. So, I think with the upgrades we brought as well to this weekend, it is extremely disappointing from our side. I mean, we're P2 but you know, looking at how the whole year has been, this, I didn't expect to happen. No, just the balance of the car. No, I don't think so, because we've been trying a few things and the upgrade looks good. It's just we didn't nail the balance of the car. Simple as that. I cannot tell you because it's just so inconsistent, like, I just went out there and suddenly it just gripped up a little bit better. And then I put the second set, and it's different again. So, it was just very difficult to drive today. Normally in Qualifying, you know, you build up to it, you have a bit of margin, and you know exactly where and how to push more. Because normally, naturally, in your second run, you improve. But today it was very hard. Yeah, I mean, I only used the Soft yesterday and it was a lot colder as well. So it's not really that representative of what will happen tomorrow when it will be even warmer. I think also yesterday maybe some other cars were still a little bit more off pace compared to today. So, normally, like Lewis said as well, when they are up front in Qualifying normally, their race car is also quite strong. So I don't expect it to be a very straightforward race. I mean, I expect us to be quick, but around here it's not easy to pass, especially when you're quite closely matched on pace. Yeah, I mean, for sure, for everyone it looks good, right? I mean, I'm just not happy with how my Qualifying went, just because of the balance. It has nothing to do with the gaps to other teams. But for sure, I think this Qualifying was very exciting, because every session, basically, you didn't really know who was actually going to be quickest, right? So I think that's a good thing. I mean I think the Alfa Romeo was quick all weekend, so for me there was no real surprise. I mean, probably some had a better lap than others on the Hard and the Medium. But probably on the Soft tyre they would have also been up there quite close, right? So, for me, it has not so much to do with the format. Of course, on the harder compound, it's also probably easier to lock up and stuff, because you have lower grip. So probably a lot of people were just still not on it, but I don't know, I like the normal format. I don't think there's anything wrong with it and I think when you have cars which are very close, like we have now in Q3 on a Soft, that was probably still the most exciting, so you can still also have that in Q1, Q2 on Soft tyres, so it doesn't really matter the format. I think it's more important, like Lewis said, on Friday that we just run, instead of just sitting in the box. People are paying so much money to sit in the grandstands and you're not doing a lot of laps, so that's not ideal. Normally when you have enough time, everyone kind of just follows each other for most of it but at that point, there were some that still needed to get a lap in. And then you know that if you're not going, you will get effed so you have to go, otherwise you will be the one who is getting screwed over in the last corner. And that creates that bit of a mess. So sometimes it happens. I guess most of the time it works out for you and sometimes it bites you. No, I don't think it is related to that. We tried quite a few things but we just didn't do the right thing at the end, I guess. Sometimes it happens. I think so far, for most of the year, we have actually nailed it for basically all the Qualifyings. I was always quite happy even. Sometimes it doesn't work out. That's how it goes. You cannot always be perfect, I know that, but I want to always try to be as close as possible to perfection. I think today we just lacked a bit but that's over one lap. Tomorrow is going to be even warmer; with actually the balance I had today that's probably not a bad thing.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I think both. It’s been a crazy year and a half. I’ve lost my voice from shouting so much in the car. It’s amazing that feeling. I feel so grateful to be up here because the team have worked so hard. We’ve been pushing so hard over this time, to finally get a pole, it feels like the first time. And a big, big thanks to the crowd here, we have such an amazing crowd, every year here in Budapest. Wow! I didn’t expect coming here today that we’d be fighting for pole, so when I went into that last run, I gave it absolutely everything. I was… there was nothing left in it. Oh, it’s been massively challenging for every single person in the team. There’s been ups and downs. It’s a big, big rollercoaster ride but none of us have lost faith, we’ve all been united together. We’re focussing on trying to steer the car into the direction… today we were losing so much in Turn Four and Turn… not so much but time in Four and 11 compared to the others, so I just sent it and hoped that I stayed on track, but it has been tough, and it’s going to continue to be tough, moving on from here – but I think hopefully this shows we’re on the right track and we can do it if we just keep pushing. Yeah, big difference in balance – but all the tyres generally felt quite good, and right at the end the Soft tyre felt extraordinary. It’s just interesting how you have to prep the tyres, and for us finally having a relatively neutral, calm balance through the corners. Through-corner balance is very difficult to get right with these type of cars, and I think we did that today, so hats off to the team, we did a great job. Oh Jeez. I just have to try and see if I can sleep tonight. I think tomorrow, we’ll study as hard as we can, we’ll bring our A-game tomorrow as a team. It’s going to be difficult to fight these two guys. Lando’s been doing a mega-job. It’s been great to see McLaren up there battling, and Max, you know Max, he’s always up there, he’s always doing his thing. I wouldn’t say that it was criticising, it was just giving a point of view. All these amazing people turn up on a Friday and want to see cars running around, and we have less tyres than normal. But the wet tyres, there’s a lot of wet tyres they throw away on the weekend, and that’s what we need to figure out how we can do better there, rather than reduce the entertainment for the fans – so I just meant on that day. I forgot what it feels like to sit in this spot! You’ve been hogging it for a while! I don’t think I breathed the whole lap. I think I held my breath, and I was just so out of breath at the end but it’s an extraordinary feeling, after you’ve been here for such a long time and you’ve had the success before, even though it’s 104, it feels like it’s the first. It’s hard to explain just how special it feels and I definitely don’t think… we definitely weren’t expecting to be fighting for pole today, though George got pole last year and was looking great, these guys were looking so strong, but of course I was hoping to be as high up as possible but then once we got to Q2, was looking quite decent all of a sudden, and obviously we were second, and once we got to Q3, we were only a tenth off Max and I knew I had more time I could find in the car. The majority of the time was being lost in Turn 2 and 4, and particularly 4 and 11. I don’t know if this guy’s lifting through there but the car was just not quite up to it on the previously laps but on the last one I just had to send it and hope that I stayed on track, and I think I got closer to them at least in those areas – but our last sector was particularly strong – but yeah, it was epic. I was so happy for everyone in the team. We’ve… it’s been a really, really difficult year and a half on a personal level, but then as a team collectively, so many ideas and trying to find the right path to be on, and continue to keep the motivation in everyone, and keep everyone driven and that’s been a challenge for all of us. So, this has been a team effort and the team deserves this today. Oh yeah. We run the simulator, and the simulator sometimes feels good, sometimes feels terrible, and then we come to the track and you’re just always hopeful that when you get in, you’ve got somewhat of a decent balance and the car doesn’t feel bad – but nine times out of ten you get in the car and you’re like, damnit, this really feels terrible, the balance is off, front to rear temperatures, there’s always just an imbalance going through corners, and so we yesterday just wasn’t great for us – but what we do best is we work hard through the night. The team work hard on the simulator, and we get new direction for Saturday. We made some really great changes to the car, naturally, last night, and it put us in a much better window. So, I was then able to just build on that. But as I said, these guys were rapid. It feels great to be up here fighting with these guys. Well, normally it’s not a bad race car. We tend to have decent race pace. Max’s race pace yesterday was, I think, quite extraordinary. I think they were a little bit… quite a bit quicker than us, but yeah, if there’s a way to hold position, then maybe there’s a fighting chance for us. But just even being up there in the top three. It’s new. We’re going to have a great race, for sure. Yeah, I'm not really sure. I mean, people said that we criticised the ATA. I think it was more just being conscious of the fans here. When we only have one set in the session, we have less running and already when they changed the rules many years ago where we only have two sets in the session it doesn't lead you to a lot of running and we have less time on track as well. So, I'm not sure that was necessarily the best for the Friday, for entertainment, but today it clearly provided great… It was great starting on the Hard in the first session and then going to the Medium, I generally enjoyed the Qualifying session in that respect. And I think when we're talking about sustainability, just taking one set of tyres or two sets of tyres away is not enough, you know. Each weekend there's a lot of Wet tyres that get thrown away, every single weekend. So we need to look at… I mean we really need to push to figure out how we can make sure that doesn't happen. There's a lot more we can do there in terms of sustainability I would say. Look, last year, for example, we were nowhere. There were ups and downs, there was a moment where we were, as I said, George was up here. But I don't think I've been on the front row since 2021. So I've always had belief… I just have that belief that someday if we apply ourselves in the right way, we will get there. I guess it was just a question of how long would that be. And we started this season, basically, with the - I'm not going to say it - but it's like the twin sister, it’s like the twin of the previous car, basically, twin sister or brother of the previous year's car. And so got in it, it felt identical and that was worrying. So we've been on this journey of trying to undo some of the wrong decisions that we've taken and it's taken far longer than we ever hoped it would take. But we're starting to see those benefits slowly and we've still got some big steps that we need to take to really to be even more comfortable in the car, to be consistently challenging the front row. Did I cover the last part? I could just imagine. I think as keen as I was when I won my first Grand Prix in 2007 in Montreal. Well, we didn't bring any upgrades this weekend so the car is the same as before. All the drivers here they're exceptional and such a huge part that probably - I don't know if it gets commented on - is having confidence in the vehicle that you're driving, with the tool that you're using and when you lose that confidence, you shed a lot of time. And it's something that… last year I had no confidence in the car. Started out this season with very little confidence in the car and bit by bit started to get the thing on the right rails, on the right track. And this weekend, here, whilst we struggle in the high speed so turns four and 11 - not so great in those two, but the others… the cars have generally been quite good in the low speeds we've discovered in the last few races. So the confidence has finally come back and that's what you're seeing today. It's literally just having the confidence to be able to throw that car into the corner and it's going to stick. And also just after driving it for so long, you get used to it and now there's no fear that it's going to throw you off into the wall, apart from some of the high speeds a little bit every now and then. But yeah, so that's it, I would say. It’s being a gentleman's agreement, really but we try to be respectful but I think in that moment everyone's panicking trying to get their laps and it was… Every man for himself. It was a dogfight. It was so cool. It was fun. With the car, I think George and I arrived with the same set-up except for just one change at the rear. And then going into FP1, I decided to make a change a relatively big step mechanically. It was kind of level I would say on the simulator but the set-up I have now was better. And so we made those changes and then there was a couple of things that George had had on the car that we were both testing different things and that ended up being the better solution for us. And then through the session, it's how you utilise the tyres, it's how you bring the tyres in, making sure you have the front tyres, for example, ready for Turn 1, without overheating the rear tyres. And that's the struggle we have, particularly on the Hard tyre, for example. It's hard to get the front tyres in, they start getting better and better through the run. And then when you go onto the Medium tyre you can have a slower out lap, like it’s cascading the whole time, you're not doing the same out lap in every Qualifying session. From the Hard, you have to go faster and then you take it… You have to do a guesstimate of how much slower you go on the Mediums. And then when you get the softs, you have to do another step. And then in between, it's just looking at every single corner where we are losing. I think, for me, it was Turn 1, 2, 4 and 11. And so I managed to fix 1, pick up 2, so it wasn't such a loss. But when I thought I was going quick through 4, then I look at these guys who are just… I think particularly the McLarens are very, very strong through the high-speed now. Yeah, it was impressive. So at the end, I just had to send it. It was the last lap. I was a tenth and a half, I had to assume they were going to have another tenth up on the next lap, so I just gave it everything. I was actually four tenths up going into the last corner but I don't know if there's a crosswind but we got a big snap and I lost a tenth and a half or something like that, almost two tenths. So it's so close with us. I would have definitely been frustrated if I had lost that. Well, I think I've been enjoying myself more this year. In truth? Just generally, the car's not been enjoyable to drive. It really hasn't, last year, particularly, there wasn't a day that the car was enjoyable to drive. And it's a Formula 1 car and you want to be able to enjoy it but it was just so nervous. Every time… it's like you're treading on eggshells as you start to apply the steering, you're going to lose the back end all the time, because our aero balance isn't where it needs to be. And so, as I said, as I started to get this confidence back today, yeah. Today was a fun day, when you can really throw it into the corners and know that it's going to just about stick with you. And it was definitely still a fight through the lap, I think we still lack rear end and that's our weakest point. But yeah, today definitely was fun. I know I was one of the last people to cross the line so I didn't really know where whereabouts I would be. And then when I heard Bono come on the radio, I just had a huge grin on my face and what a feeling, an uplifting feeling for everyone in the team.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Daniel Ricciardo,"Thanks, it’s good to be back. It feels… I don’t know. It doesn’t feel that foreign, like it feels familiar. I guess it hasn’t been that long. It’s good. Very good. A lot of people are happy so that’s good as well. Yeah, for sure. But I think getting back into the Red Bull family this year, it brings back a lot of old feelings and things that I was used to growing up and being part of that team or the Junior Team when I was younger. I think one thing, it was always like be prepared, you never know what’s going to happen. Let’s say, I didn’t expect to maybe be in the car in Budapest, for example, but you never know. Surprised, but maybe not that surprised. Yeah. It’s been good. I’ve enjoyed this year in general, just going to the races and as I say, being back in the Red Bull family, I think it’s been a lot of fun. It also personally gave me some time away, which I felt was definitely needed, and I probably expected the year off. Obviously I haven’t got the whole year but I’ve actually felt like I’ve had enough time. It fuelled me, energised me and I’m definitely ready to go again. Oh, it was just like little luxuries, like having a bit more time to just not be on a plane every few days. But also, it's funny how used to that kind of cadence you get, so as much as it was nice to maybe spend a bit more time at home or do some things with friends – I went to a buddy's bachelor party, which I don't think I've ever done. So that was cool. It was in a little place called Vegas as well. These are things you don't… I'll show you later. But anyway, that was just some fun things but it's just more having a little bit more, I guess, free time. But that being said, I feel like I got my fix. And we're back and I'm happy to be back. Well, the car I drove a week ago was a pleasure, for sure, and that was something, for me, that was just so nice to get back into a car again. And it was the last box I kind of needed to tick to just make sure that this is what I truly want. I quickly got into that flow, so that was good. I obviously know that this weekend and now for the rest of the season it's a different car and for sure, with some different challenges but I'm just going to get out there, not think too much about it, drive, and then go from there and just take some steps forward after that. So I'm lone wolf. Lone wolf, is that what you call it? I’ve got Pyry [Salmela] helping me out. You might know him as Piru, Piry, I don't know, but I got the right pronunciation. So Pyry is going to just help out on race weekends just to kind of make the flow of the weekend go a little smoother. But yeah, like a lot of things, in this time off… I always said if I come back to the sport, I want to do things a little differently. I also wanted to find that self-motivation and make sure that… I wanted it to come from me, you know what I mean? The training, all of it, the mindset, I wanted to get back into the sport, because it's truly coming from me and what my heart desires. So I've been doing it myself this year and I've got the answers I wanted. I was asking how old he was when he was watching 10 years ago. So he was 12. It's crazy. It's all good. It's all positive. That's two, what's another one? Lots of optimism. Well, look, the team has… So. I was there last week, the facility has changed a lot in the last 10 years since I was there. So it felt like a, let's say, a new team or a fresh environment. But also, 10 years is a long time. That team has changed. I've changed, you know. There's a nice kind of nostalgia going back. But I feel like we both evolved. And I'm starting this next phase, next chapter, with a very kind of fresh, I don't know, page. Also for me, I needed to after, let's say, stepping aside from the sport for a little bit, I think I kind of changed my perspective on things. So, I'm just coming into this without any… ‘Oh, what's it going to be like? Oh, it's going to be a struggle here. it's going to be frustrating’. I'm just happy to have this opportunity. I think just getting an opportunity again inside the Red Bull family is something I'm really appreciative of. So that's really where my head's at. Just try and enjoy it. I'm sure we'll have some work to do. But I'm not going to solve every problem this weekend. So it's really just about me getting back into the race weekend and the flow. And, you know, last week of course it was a very good car I drove but it filled me with some confidence. So try to take a little bit of that into this but also not to expect the world. Just day by day. Firstly, no bets. Yeah. OK. Really? Alright. Let's see how the first few races go and then I might start making some bets. The sim. There was, I think, a lot of… You know, when I first drove the sim, I could see it now that a bit of time had passed. And, you know, obviously, I haven't been in a race seat for a few months. I could kind of see myself last year, as an example, that was, yeah, lacking. And I knew it at the time, but you know, you see things a bit more clearly, probably, with hindsight as well. So, yeah, I was just kind of lacking a little bit of that confidence and that just kind of going out there and just driving, in simple terms. You just get probably other thoughts that creep into your mind. And I think, also going back into Red Bull, you know, it was exciting for me, but I was also, for sure, a little bit nervously excited. So yeah, probably just that comfort or confidence, you know, those first few runs on the sim. It took a little bit to probably just shake a few things out and try to just find my old self again. I think what helped a lot was working with Simon, so Simon Rennie, my engineer at Red Bull back when I was racing there. He's been running the sim. So I think that as well, kind of getting a bit of familiarity, working with him, kind of quickly got my confidence back. And obviously you look at the data and try to learn from Max and Checo who are very familiar with that car. But yeah, I think the really nice thing was that once I shook off the cobwebs, although the car is different to five years ago or so, it still felt, for me, like a Red Bull Car. I felt like everything that I used to really like about the car was still existing in like the DNA and then I think that as well filled me with some confidence that I could start to drive the way that I like or the way I want. So the trajectory then was good. And as I said, the last tick of the box was driving the real car to make sure that I could do it on track. And the test went well and we're in a good place. Firstly, I'm not worried. I know there will be challenges, for sure. I know that it's probably going to be a car that we're going to have to work at, probably every weekend. I mean, everyone's working on it, but probably a little bit more at the moment with where it's at. But look, I don't see the, let's say, pessimistic point of view or being worried about this or that, or if the car doesn't suit me, it's just, for me, like an opportunity now. I think the time off was really, really beneficial for me. And I'm in a place now where I'm just hungry and ready to go. And that's really it. That's where I'm looking at. Yeah, so, pretty pumped.",Hungary,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"We want to see the pictures. Yeah, we talked with Daniel a bit earlier last week and also with Nyck, obviously. I know them both. I think they're two fantastic drivers. It's great to see Daniel back on the grid and seeing what's up for grabs with him. And obviously kind of sad to see Nyck going because I've known him for the past, probably 15 years. I just know he's a great guy and his chance probably didn't achieve as much as he would have liked, but I just want to wish him the best and as Max said, there'll be plenty of opportunities out there for him. He’s old enough and he knows Franz well enough to know what to do with him, but no, I just think it’s great. He started there, he’s back there now, he still has plenty of years ahead of him and always enjoyed some battles with him on the race track. So it’s going to be the case. Yeah, the final result looked really bad for us, it was two DNFs I think. Ultimately, we were fighting with Fernando for the majority of the race and the performance wasn't as bad as the final result. We know we’ve got to improve performance. We know we’ve got to find more speed. We are not fighting for the position that we would like at the minute, but it's not like we are miles behind so we’ve just got to keep our heads down and bring more upgrades on the car and do the talking on track. Honestly, I'll take anything you know, I think the chance to be racing in your own country in front of your own crowd, it's a very unique and special feeling, which I've had the chance to experience versus other French drivers who raced some years ago. It would be something incredible. Obviously, Le Castellet is an option, Magny Cours, and then obviously Nice, they're talking about a street track there. I haven't seen yet what's the proposed plan there but definitely it’s something important and it's good to have the support from President Macron and I really hope they can find an agreement with Formula 1 to get it back on the calendar and for Alpine it would be huge. You have two French drivers, with Esteban, so that would mean a lot, yeah.",Hungary,thursday,Alpine
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, very happy for him to be back. I remember watching when it was two Aussies last time around. So it's very, very cool. We're from a long way away and it's pretty rare to have two of us at the same time. So from a country with such a small population relative to Europe. It's very, very cool to have two of us on the big stage. Yeah, I was 12. Mostly satisfaction. Compared to where we had been at points during the season, to be disappointed with fourth place seemed a little bit harsh but without that Safety Car, there's always a question of what could have been, but I was just super happy to be back towards the front and for the whole team to be genuinely there on merit was very refreshing and a nice reward for our hard work, I think. Now we've got to try and maintain that and try and fight towards the front again. So yeah, I was thinking there might be a trophy coming my way for quite a lot of that race but hopefully I've got some more chances. Yes and no. I think the car is obviously a fair bit quicker than what we had at the start of the season. I think it still has quite similar strengths and weaknesses that we've started to address but still need some more work. So the car doesn't feel massively different. It's not like it's a completely different animal to drive now. So we'll have our strong tracks. I think Silverstone with all the high-speed corners suited us quite nicely. Here is obviously a much lower-speed circuit so we'll see how we go. I think we will try and be optimistic, that we can stay more towards the front but whether we'll be fighting for a podium again, I'm not quite sure.",Hungary,thursday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I spoke already quite a bit with Daniel last week. I could see he was very excited, also after driving our car. So yeah, of course, it's great to have Daniel back on the grid and within the family. Of course, on the other side, I’m also good friends with Nyck, so it's also sad to see him go but unfortunately that's also how this world works. I don't think there are any hard feelings between the drivers, that's just how it goes. But yeah, you have to move on. There are a lot of other opportunities out there. It's not only Formula 1 in this world of racing. So I'm sure everyone will land back on their feet like normal and yeah, you move on. And now the opportunity is here with Daniel again. He had his little reset, I think including Vegas, so I think he's ready to go again. I don't know. I'm honestly not really thinking about that. I'm just here to have a good weekend. Of course, I will try to win. I'm not going into this weekend thinking we can win 12 races in a row. So yeah. If we win, that means of course we break that record, but it's more important that we win. They look good. No, no. Normally it makes the car a bit faster, but it also looks nice. In the corners… Mainly. Everyone of course always tries to improve the car, right? So that's also what we are trying to do. Of winning Wimbledon? You have experience with that? No? OK. He likes his bets, but he actually goes quite far, Helmut. There’s always quite a bit of money involved. Yeah, I mean, I never actually wanted him to leave. But no, I mean, all of these things. We know that we get on very well. And yeah, I mean, if Daniel of course does well where he is now, then of course you have the opportunity to go back up, right? So it's all open to be honest. Well it's a tough one. But you know, if the decision was anyway, of course, already made, then I don't think it really matters a lot when it happens. But I mean, I think it’s just circumstances. I think we all know that Nyck, you know, he's an incredible driver. He's shown that in every single category. And, you know, when the car's a little bit difficult… And I think anyway, you know, this new generation of cars, when you're a rookie, doesn't matter of course, what age you are or whatever, they are quite difficult I think to get on top of. Plus that the car probably is not the most competitive, it all made it a bit harder. And then I think you just sometimes need these one or two moments where you shine. You know where you maybe get a point or two points and yeah, these kinds of moments they didn't happen. And yeah, then the team wanted to change something. That's also a part of Formula 1, it’s sometimes just the wrong time or the wrong moment when you're there and it doesn't work out for you. But again, people, sometimes they seem to [think] if it doesn't work out in F1 everything is lost, but it's not. I mean, there's so many great categories out there where you can have a great career and probably even more fun than some places in Formula 1 even. So I know that he has a lot of opportunities. I mean, I spoke to him last week, we saw each other. And, yeah, he will definitely find his feet again with a great team somewhere and a great championship. So I don't think it actually is the end of the world because like I said, in endurance as well, there's so many great races that you can be part of.",Hungary,thursday,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Winning Wimbledon? For sure not! No, just proud, I guess proud for my country. We seem to have this relatively small population for a country like Spain, but we still seem to produce some good athletes out there, since Rafa, Fernando, the basketball team is always good, the football team is always good. We seem to be doing well in sports and now with golf, tennis also, again with Alcaraz. It's a good time to be Spanish and to follow sports because you have a lot of fun on the TV watching every Sunday, someone wins or someone is doing well or there is someone to support and be excited about and yeah, just proud of my country and the athletes we produce. Yeah, I do. And if you remember, before Silverstone, I was the first one to say, wait for Silverstone because I had the feeling that going back to a proper high-speed track, windy track, I felt like we had done some good steps forward, but still especially in this tight battle for second behind Red Bull and Max the teams are very, very tight and it's very close between Mercedes, us, Aston Martin, now McLaren, see if Alpine joins or not, but it's really, really tight. So one weekend you're going to be a tenth in front and another weekend you're going to be a tenth behind and it's a swing of two tenths, that it could change just the outcome of the whole weekend and you could look like ‘oh, now we're back in P2, P3, P4’ and then the next weekend you’re P7 and P8 and the result change is massive, but the relative performance that you've gained or lost is actually not that much. It's just that the track suits you better or McLaren better or Aston better or Mercedes better. It's important not to overreact and just know that so far, there's going to be good weekends, some not so good weekends. Hopefully a bit better. I think we are all a bit hopeful that Hungaroring should suit us a bit more. But again, it will depend. Unfortunately, with our car, it depends a lot on the track temperature. It depends a lot on the wind situation. We know we have certain weaknesses that make us vulnerable and make us sensitive to these kinds of things but if conditions are good for our car, I think we should be relatively strong around here. Yeah, personally, it would be obviously a very special way to dedicate a podium or a victory to my grandfather that died last week. But yeah, it will all depend on how the car is, how we can put a good weekend together here. Hungary, I love it. I always like driving here. I love the vibe. I love the track. It always has a good flow. And hopefully it's also good for my car and I can have that good weekend. I mean, it's top of my wish list right now, for sure. No, I personally agree with Fréd. I think in Ferrari right now there's much bigger priorities than sorting out the future of its drivers. Also, personally, with so many races consecutively, it’s not like you can stop for a minute and really think about your future and what you want to do and what do you see in the next two or three years happening for you. I think with so many back-to-backs, so many races, it’s difficult. I’m not going to lie, there's the three-week break in August that I will start maybe thinking a bit what I would be happy with or, or whatever. And then the winter break, that I think is what I said in that interview a while ago, that it will be time to start figuring out where I will be racing in ’25. But going back to Fréd, I fully agree, because in Ferrari there's much bigger priorities, much bigger, more important things that we need to sort out in the short term. And that is my priority: to be competitive with Ferrari, not only this year, but also next year that I still have a contract in place and get next year's car right and get it better than where we are now.",Hungary,thursday,Ferrari
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, exactly. Obviously, I got invited to watch. There was a choice between the women's final and the men's. So I watched the men's on Sunday before heading over this weekend. So that was really fun. Actually, you know, it was my first ever time. I don't really play tennis myself, but actually, it was the first match I watched and it was quite impressive to be honest. Just how silent it is before every serve. You know, that's quite impressive to see, where in Formula 1 you have, like, massive DJ music before on the starting grid – a bit different. But yeah, it was really enjoyable actually, and both players put on an incredible show on that day. Well, Silverstone, to be honest, I think in terms of the preparation and throughout the weekend, we didn’t do exactly the perfect job. Especially, obviously from my side, there was an issue before FP3, where we made a massive change during the night with the set-up before heading over for Qualifying. So I have no, let’s say, practice into it. And then Quali was damp, it was OK, and then the last lap was the only dry lap I got, so I didn’t really maximise everything, which sacrificed quite a bit the weekend. But yeah, it's clear like, as a team, we made maybe a more visible step forward compared to the upgrade we bought into Silverstone. So it's been not an easy one so far, and clearly lacking a little bit of pace compared to where we want it to be. I think, you know, we shouldn't be as far back as we were in Silverstone, because Silverstone is a track… Obviously, you have high speed, but also you have a lot of long straights and a lot of corners are flat now, you know, Copse, all these corners, almost flat. So I think here we’ll be a little bit stronger. And obviously, we have no upgrade for this weekend, but we just need to figure out, you know, get a bit more on top of what we have actually got before the summer break. Yeah, of course. You know, we’re aiming obviously to…. At the beginning of the year we aim a little bit higher, to at least maintain trying to be P6, if not higher up, we clearly don’t achieve that. But on the other hand, we were very close together with Williams, and also Haas, for the whole season and unfortunately got overtaken for that last weekend, so not ideal. The pressure is high, but I think the main focus is really to get more out of the package, you know, to be quicker in terms of developing more upgrades coming through the second half of the season. And it's clear, you know, if we have the performance of the car, and we can develop or deliver what Alex or both Williams was doing the whole weekend, they was extremely quick, top three all sessions. I was alive. I guess the answer is going to be fashion designer. I always think that maybe in the future to have our own brand. Doesn't matter how popular is it. Just something that I can do on time off or not racing. Obviously, it's great to see what Nicholas is doing, taking away a little bit from the racing, doing what he loves, because I think he can have all the opportunity to do other stuff besides motorsport. Unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan of… obviously education is important, but I wasn't a favourite of that. Maybe other people will go back that.",Hungary,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Fernando Alonso,"No. It was enough, one week in Silverstone already. I do remember. It was obviously a magical moment of my life and my career as well. It changed a little bit everything after that. And yeah, it was a Qualifying that we had to put the fuel for the race, for the first stint. So we thought on Saturday night that we were very light on fuel and maybe, you know, the race would unfold differently. And maybe top five was possible or a podium, I think, was the realistic target. We ended up winning the race. And it was a little bit of a surprise and we were very happy. I think it changed a little bit, especially off track, many things in my life, and in Spain as well. No more privacy in my life since 20 years. Yeah, I mean, the first win is probably a big thing and it happened to all the drivers. And as I said, for me, it was a big change. Now into this weekend we do have, you know, some hopes into this weekend after some struggles in Austria and Silverstone, so hopefully a better one. I think because the layout of the track and the characteristics are a little bit more similar to the circuits that we did perform well at so far this year, and I think high-speed corners, long straights are not maybe the strength of our package. And I think Austria and Silverstone were a clear example of those. So yeah, hopefully here, we can come back to a stronger performance, even though our main competitors, they improved their packages, and they will be very strong as well here. So it's going to be difficult, but hopefully good fun. Yeah, why not? I think it will not change too many things. As you said, we have to use a certain type of tyre in each of the Qualifyings, but it's the same for everybody. So it should not be a thing that should change too many things. And we save couple of sets, I think, for Pirelli. Instead of 13, we have 11 per driver. So two sets for 20 drivers, obviously, there are a lot of sets that maybe Formula 1 can save. So there is a reason behind that, you know, we should support and least try. And let's see after this weekend if there are any tweaks that maybe are needed for the future. Same. We are jealous. For sure. Yeah. Don’t want to add anything. yep. No idea. Work as the assistant of Zhou, probably. Journalist! I guess so. Yeah. Are you good? Sure, 100 per cent. Always, you remember your first win and you know every time I come here… it's like Brazil, when I won the Championships there, you still have a special relationship with that race and that city and Budapest is one of my favourite cities and grands prix, and apart from that first win, we had good races here: in 2006, I remember, starting at the back; 2009, pole, Yeah, has always a special track with special races. Yeah. Well, we had a couple of issues, especially the wheel nut in 2006 when we were leading the race, and yeah, and some other… 2007 a penalty with Lewis in the pit-lane, that I was on pole and I started tenth.  that I was on Paul and I started 10th. That championship we lost in Brazil for one point. So, that was incredible. So yeah, you know, I've been always enjoying here. Some ups and downs in terms of results and incredible only one win, but always enjoying. It’s going to be a tight battle until the end. So yeah, let's see what is the final position. We also forget that behind us there are some strong competitors and very fast teams and drivers. Ferrari and McLaren now, so we’re still P3 in the Championship and we aim to finish P2 but with the feet in the ground, and knowing that it’s going to be a tight battle until the end. For the book, yes, I know that it was out there for a couple of months, but it was you know, again, not my book, or not under my permission. So yeah, probably a similar thing to George, if he doesn't know anything from that book yet. And on the privacy thing, it is a tough question. I don't know. Obviously, we try to live our dream which is racing in the fastest cars in the world and in Formula 1 and we, from a very young age in go-karts, we dream to be here, and seated here. But obviously you never put in the balance some of the sacrifices that you have to make and some of the changes in your life and your family's life that will happen eventually if you get to Formula 1. So, I guess I will not change anything, because still your own choice and you try to succeed and to follow your dreams, but probably things are a little bit more difficult than what you see on TV on Sundays, you know? There are 20, 30 years, 40 years of your life that will change forever. Probably the same thing is that when you close the visor on Sunday, still the same motivation and the same joy of racing. So that formation lap, that race start, everything. The adrenaline of driving these cars and compete against the best drivers and teams in the world and try to succeed, this is exactly the same as 20 years ago. I do have more experience of tracks, so the way you prepare the race with your engineers, the strategies, the knowledge on the tyres, and how to prepare the race, it is different now. The level of stress is different now as well. Knowing what you will come probably in the race, all the different scenarios that may come in the race, there are not too many surprises, let's say, in my head or in my race. So yeah, that's a little bit different. But the good thing is that the DNA of competition is still the same. And that's the most fun part of our job. We don't know. Obviously it is still one factor that we still need to analyse a little bit more in detail in the next few races. I'm not a fan of changing the rules in the middle of a championship. In sport, you know, you change the balls in the middle of the tennis tournament or something like that, and it’s what  happens when we change tyres here, we change the rules in the middle of a Formula One World Championship. But you know, at the end of the day, is the same for everybody again, so we just need to understand the tyre the best we can, and hopefully extract the maximum. If there is any change. As I said, we're still not 100 per cent sure. We need couple of races to confirm anything. So far, they look very similar but we need to wait and see. I would not change anything. I don't regret anything. No one has a crystal ball to know what is the performance of the teams in the following year. When I left Renault, which was the first decision, I joined McLaren, and that season, we fought for the World Championships. So, in terms of how competitive we were, it was a good thing and a good move. Then I joined Ferrari, I don't think any of the drivers will reject an offer from Ferrari and join that team. And we fought for three Championships of the five years that I was there. Then I joined McLaren-Honda, which was a project that we all thought that it could be interesting and powerful. It didn't work – OK, that thing can happen in this sport. And then I stopped Formula 1 because I had too many things in my head and too many challenges that I wanted to try. And it was a wonderful time in my career to try the endurance racing and that car, and Indy, with quite good success as well. So happy for that. And then I came back to Formula One with what I always considered my family in Alpine, in Renault. And now the last decision which for everyone's opinion was the worst one, to go for Aston Martin. It was the best one, arguably of my career. So that just shows the difficulty of choosing teams, and lack of knowledge that everyone has at home.",Hungary,thursday,Aston Martin
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, I think I'm making steps in the right direction, but I'm still not where I want to be. There's plenty of work to still be done. But I see the progress. I see it's moving in the right direction and that's what matters. But yeah, I'm still striving to be better. And I think this weekend in particular isn't going to be, you know, perfect for what we have in our car, but we'll make the most of it. And, yeah, hopefully I’ll optimise on what we were just speaking about with a different qualifying format. I think, you know, for sure, Budapest isn’t a track that's going to be great for us. So we have to manage expectations coming off the back of two decent weekends for the team. But yeah, I think there's always opportunity. You never know until you put the car on the ground. So we'll stay optimistic and see what we can do. 2003? I was alive. I wouldn’t have watched that. Honestly, I've never thought of it. I don't really want to think about it! So I'm not sure. I mean, from my side he's been driving amazing and for me being a rookie, it's been really good to be able to learn from that. And yeah, he's really set the benchmark. He gets everything out of the car every weekend and that's what I'm trying to get to. So, perfect person for me to try and reach and yeah, it's also good for the team and it’s good to see. He’s just fast everywhere, that's for sure. I feel like just you can really see the experience, you can see that he's gone through ups and downs in Formula 1 and he really knows how to get the most out of the car, get the most out of the team and how to put himself in the best position coming Sunday.",Hungary,thursday,Williams
Nico Hülkenberg,"Fascinating what a bit of dyed hair can do. No, not a bet. It's just a bit of… You know, that Barbie movie came out and I thought a bit of extra PR for me would be pretty handy this time of the season. Actually, no, I wasn't aware about it. I didn't really play with Barbie and Ken when I was a child. So I just ran into this one and bad timing I guess. Yeah, I mean, a lot more smiles, a lot more teeth. You know, you can see there. It’s going to be interesting to see. I think there's actually quite a strong race car [there and it] will be interesting to see what Danny can do with it. Obviously, he's had now a good like eight or nine months out, a bit of a reset and, you know, to be out of the hot seat for a while I think is quite nice. I speak from experience. So he's probably quite fresh and reset and ready to go. So I'm going to be exciting to see what he can do. … Where are you going? Yeah, as confident as we can be. I mean, it's been a bit tough lately, bit of a dry spell also in terms of points scoring – apart from obviously Austria in the Sprint race. Here, it's very hot, it’s very demanding on tyres so you know, it's going to be definitely a tough weekend for us. We have a few little upgrades to the car, on the floor. So hopefully, they can push us along a little bit but I expect the very, tight field again, so every session matters, every lap matters. I think Quali, for us, with the new rules of how we have to run the tyres, with the Hard in Q1, is probably not favourable for us. So, extra challenge there, but we'll just take it on. I'll sit down with him regardless. Maybe there is no deal to be done? Maybe deal is in place? Who knows? I'm pretty happy and relaxed. I think it works both ways at the moment, and I'm enjoying myself. I think the team is also in a good place. So, there's no reason not to think why that relationship shouldn't continue like this. Yeah, same. Are you a good negotiator? You got a good deal on this? Because, you know, he loves F1, but he doesn't do it for free, so… ? Yeah. I was 16, so I must have seen it but the memories are a bit blurry. Yeah, I don't know. Probably, accountant, lawyers, something steady solid income and that has a long future.",Hungary,thursday,Haas
George Russell,"Yeah, I’ll be pushing for it, for sure. I’m looking forward to seeing what the weekend is going to hold. It's been an interesting few races, with our performance in Austria, then really quite strong in Silverstone. We’re still battling forward, still really focused to keep on progressing. We're in a good position, but we need to try and stay ahead of our competitors. I think that's the same for all the teams up and down the grid. You see Aston, at the start of the year, were really, really strong. They’ve maybe taken a small step backwards. Same with Ferrari at certain races. And I'm sure even Red Bull to a small degree. At some races, they were 30 seconds ahead, last week, they were three seconds ahead, albeit with the safety car, but they weren't running away with things. So, we are closing that gap. It seems like the whole field is slightly more compact, which makes it exciting. And the small details make a big difference. As I said, we're focused, we've got P2 in the Constructors’ Championship in our sights, and what we're aiming for, but we're still pushing for more, and try and get some race wins along the way. I think it's very exciting and Crofty’s got something to be worried about. So no, I think is great, what were you guys doing, Formula 1 bringing the kid show to the sport, and I know with my niece and nephew who follow the sport a lot, for them to have the chance to see it in a slightly younger format, it’s going to be exciting. So, looking forward to seeing what you guys are up to. Should we? Should we gang up on him somehow? Yep, we are jealous. Yeah, for sure. For sure we were jealous. But we all get our opportunity to stand on that podium. He's getting the opportunity a few more times than we are, but things have a way of working themselves out. So, I'm sure, hopefully the tables will turn in the near future. I'm not aware of this at all! That’s a triple no. Are you aware of this?  I have no idea. I’m intrigued now and I will check it out. Is it on Amazon? All right. I'll Google it. I was still sucking on dummies, I think. [To Logan] 2003. Were you alive? OK, Zhou? I’ve seen the replays. I've seen the infamous wave around the last corner. Was that this one? Oh, what Fernando said: journalist in Formula 1. Stay with you guys. No idea, no idea. Yeah, really happy to see…  Alex is a very talented driver and just happy to see in the right environment what he's capable of doing. And equally for Williams, they’re a team who work really hard. They had a few years of difficulties and now also with James there, I think they're definitely on the right tracks to try and push themselves to the front of the midfield. So I couldn't be happier for James, Alex and Williams as a whole.",Hungary,thursday,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, we had a terrible start, so we need to look into why that was – but even after that, I think, especially Lando, he was very… well both McLarens… were super-quick. So, I took a few laps to pass them and that at one point I could ease-out a gap and I think everything looked quite alright again. But then again, after the Safety Car, on the softest compound around here, it was a little bit more tricky for us to keep them alive, basically, so the gap basically stayed a bit around 3-3.5 seconds. So, of course, very happy that we won again, I mean, 11 wins in a row for the team, I think that’s pretty incredible but it wasn’t straightforward today. Yeah, I mean I was doing a bit of drifting on Thursday with marketing and it felt like I was also doing it on this start, which wasn’t very good. It was just very bad. We’ll look into that, because I think the last few starts were actually a lot better, and then today wasn’t that great. But at least it made it a bit more exciting. I had to push for it. Lando didn’t really put up a fight, he was very nice to me but then he came back in the DRS, so he had a lot of pace today. He did very well today. Yeah, it wasn't particularly straightforward. I had a bad start, a lot of wheel spin. So, I had to work my way up again to Lando, took a few laps, then also took a few laps to cool down the tyres again in the lead, because Lando came back at me again in the DRS. But then once everything settled in, we lap-after-lap could open up the gap to, I think at one point, it was like nine seconds before the Safety Car came out. So, I guess that was very positive. Everything was working quite well but it was still quite surprising to see that the McLaren was actually that quick, or Lando was that quick, over the whole stint. And then, of course, because of the Safety Car, we had to make the decision what tyre to put on: the Soft or the Hard, so we opted to go for the Soft, which at the time I thought was right. But when I restarted, it took only two, three laps and then I realised that it was quite tricky to keep them under control with the temperatures. The gap, of course, stayed quite similar, but it wasn't particularly nice to drive. So, we'll look into that, maybe we should have gone on the Hard tyre, at least we could have pushed a little bit harder over the whole stint. Maybe, of course, the first two, three laps are a bit more difficult, but at least towards the end, probably it was a bit faster. Yeah, just a lot of wheelspin, and, of course, as soon as that happens you lose so much drive, all the way to Turn 1. And then, Lando was in front, I just tried to stay out of trouble through Turns 3, 4, then I had a little battle with Oscar into Copse, had to stay on the outside. But yeah, it all worked out. No, they were not serious, but I like to report these things to the team. The wind was very, very bad. At one point, it was really unpredictable. So that's what I reported. That was 2020! That was a great year. Yeah, that was a good one. It’s very confusing to me because every single race weekend, it's someone else. I think is because it's so close behind that if you get your car in a little bit of a better window, it works on one particular track. So for me, I don't know what's going to happen in Hungary to be honest, who is going to be quick or the second quickest. The stable factor so far is that every single weekend, it seems like we are on top, which of course is the most important from our side. But again, Hungary completely different track, we will put some upgrades on the car there and hopefully they will work well. Almost new. Well, you can see a little bit of a picture on Friday. I was definitely positively surprised with the pace of the McLaren in the race that they were actually very quick compared to even, you know, the cars behind. But at the end of the day you just have to focus on yourself throughout the whole weekend and then you just find out anyway what happens behind you right? But yeah, positively surprised. Let's see what the next race will bring again. Yeah, I just wanted to check in with the team. Make sure that they didn't fall asleep! Yeah, I just saw the Ferrari pit and I was like: “So we just stick to our strategy, right?” “Yep, stick to the strategy.” “OK, let's just get on with the job.” Yeah, that's pretty much it. I mean, then of course, with the Safety Car. We would have probably pitted quite soon anyway. I still need to ask the team if we would have pitted onto a Soft or still on a Hard tyre, I don't know, probably on the Soft, but maybe that's why it's good that the Safety Car came out and saved a few laps. But I don’t know at the moment. Drag, low speed, medium speed, high speed, DRS effect, tyre wear… All of these areas. That's what we're working on! Braking performance. Yeah, I'm not kidding.",Great Britain,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah! Pretty insane. I just want to say a big thanks first of all to the whole team: they’ve done an amazing job and none of this would be possible without the hard work that they’ve been putting in, so pretty amazing, pretty insane. They put me on Hard tyres, I don’t know why, they’re still beginners in some things! It was an amazing fight with Lewis, to hold him off, I made a few too many mistakes maybe. I did what I could, I brought the fight to Max for as long as possible. It’s a long, lonely race when you’re just in the middle but it’s amazing. Yeah. I think they just wanted to give me a bit more of a test, I guess. That’s what Zak said anyway. Probably Zak called the shots on that one. I wanted the Softs. I feel it made a bit more sense, especially with the Safety Car coming out – but I don’t care. I’m P2, so all good. Yeah, pretty amazing. The whole in-lap I was just trying to wave to everyone. So, a big thanks to all the British fans out here supporting all of us. Also for McLaren. Honestly, we should have have P2 and P3. Oscar did an amazing job all weekend, and he should have been P3 today without the Safety Car, so a shame, he deserved it. The fans are amazing – so a big thanks to all of them. I'd probably say one of the best. I would say the best, most exciting one. I think your first podium in Formula 1 is always pretty, pretty special, that's the one you remember forever but maybe not when you’ve got as many as they do. But for me, I'm still in that phase where every one means a lot and especially my first one here at my home Grand Prix is very special, hearing everyone chanting and seeing all the fans, seeing all the team below the podium, again it's something like I saw back in 2007, 2008 when I first started watching Formula 1 and seeing Lewis and Fernando here. And now it's my turn to… this was a couple years ago. It's pretty stressful to be here now and be in that position, especially on a day like today with how tricky it was at times so I'm very, very proud. My heart was racing a bit more than normal and I was watching the crowd a few times and just yeah, just watching them. All right, look at look at this guy! [to Hamilton]. Shush, shush. The team have done a good job, they've improved the car. The last few weekends we've been extremely good so I'm very happy for them. But yeah, to get the launch kind of saved me quite a bit, saved me from some of the chaos behind because you never know what can happen in Turn 3 and Turn 4. I managed to push on quite a bit the first few laps which was exactly what we wanted to do. It just doesn't always go to plan but we planned for that and it got me out of trouble and we had a very good pace the first stint. We managed to break away from everyone quite a bit, managed to go with Max for a little bit, just not as much as what I would have loved to do. It's a very difficult one to answer. Would I have preferred the Soft? Would the Soft have made me be under less stress for the first three laps after the Safety Car? I think absolutely. I didn't have a new Soft. Were you guys on new Softs? No. They told me new Softs. I didn't think they did, but they told us. So we would have been in the same position. So I don't see why we shouldn't have done it. I feel like we put ourselves under a lot more pressure to try and get a Hard tyre to work with a Safety Car restart with only 10 laps to go pretty much. It's one we'll talk about. I was telling them to think of the Softs quite a bit, insinuating it as much as I could but then they just told me “you're on the Hards”. Not really what I wanted, but it's still worked out. Yeah, it was a very good one. It was exciting. I really did want to hold on to P2, so I did everything I could and a lot of it was trying to get the temperature in the tyres for the restart. But luckily as he said the first half a lap they were very strong, even in Qualifying they were up on us all the way until Maggotts, Becketts section. We were just very good always in the last sector. Not the best, maybe with DRS. That's where Red Bull are extremely quick, but they're very good in the first half so Turn 3, Turn 4, Turns 6 and 7, Lewis could quite easily get on me. But then we've always been very good in high speed and now it's a very good strength of ours, it keeps the tyres in a good condition and I was a lot of laps quite easily flat through Turn 9 and yeah, two downshifts into Maggotts and Becketts and I could always give myself that safety margin that I wanted but it was nice coming out side-by-side. It was close, when I saw him I throw it up the inside in Turn 7. And yeah, I'm sure the fans were loving it at the same time but I chose a slightly lower downforce level yesterday which was a bit of a risk but I thought there might be a racing situation where one or two kph might have helped me out and today I did exactly that. So I'm thanking my own decision to choose a lower downforce. It's definitely not been present in the car all season. Yeah, Bahrain was quite the opposite. These tracks allow us to look after the tyres well. Like I said we're very, very competitive in high speed. We're almost on par with what Red Bull could achieve and actually, I would say towards the medium speed like Turn 15 here, Stowe, I would say we're close to being the best car on the grid. Super, super high speed like Turn 9, maybe not quite so much but that was in Qualifying and then when we come to the race we definitely maintain our performance when others seem to take a bit of a hit. And in doing so we can actually look after the tyres pretty well, especially when there's no thermal limitation within tyre like there was necessarily today. But we do have a poor car and I say poor, I would say pretty terrible in the slow-speed corners, extremely difficult to drive. I feel if we’re getting excited and I accept that, but we're going to go to a couple of tracks coming up where I'm sure people are going to be saying “what have you done now? Like, how has it got so bad all of a sudden.” So, we've improved a lot of things: tyre degradation, there's always little things you try and do with tyre cooling and blah, blah, blah, but nothing big from that side. It's just this track’s allowed us to look after the tyres nicely, keep them in a good condition. Simple as that. So a lot of it is track-specific. I don't want to get too excited, but good things have come from the upgrade but there's still plenty of things which are a miles away from, say, competing in certain places with a Mercedes and as a whole package competing even with a Red Bull. So a lot more work to be done from both of those areas. What did you say? I was seven. Yeah, you're pretty old, mate! Yeah, well, I was seven years old. I’d never been to a race in Formula 1 and 2017 was my first ever Formula 1 race that I went to. And I was here with McLaren. Until then, I'd only ever watched it on TV. So those times were, yeah. I mean, that was it, 2007 and 2008, seeing the beautiful team teamwork of Lewis and Fernando (laughs) reminds me of all of my relationships, my team-mates. So yeah, that is genuinely still what made me want to become a racing driver today and to be sitting here and to be fighting and being a Formula One driver. I guess little did I know that Lewis would still be here 15 years later and still going strong. So fair play to him. It's an honour to be able to race with these guys who have created history and been some of the best drivers ever that have come through Formula 1. So, it is special and I guess I want to be someone who can join in on those battles and be part of all of this and create some of my own history. So it's an honour, a privilege, I guess, in many ways and exciting at the same time. I feel for him to be honest. He should be sitting here. Like, you know, if things went to plan and there wasn't a Safety Car. So it's a bit of a shame. He deserved his first podium in Formula 1. I think it would have been amazing for us as team McLaren and celebrating our 60th anniversary and the Google Chrome livery, you know, all of these things, to share it, I think, would have been pretty special. And he deserves it. He's been on top form all weekend. Yeah, he's been pushing me an insane amount, which is a good thing. It's raised the level of what we do as a team. But all year he’s been good. You know, it's not like he's just turned up here and been strong. He's been good since day one in the car and makes my life tough sometimes. Yeah, I don't always like it, but it's a good thing at the end of the day, and it makes me a better driver, too. I feel for him and the team. We did everything we should have done to be P2 and P3. So it's a shame he's not sat here too, but yeah, he'll have his chance. He’s driving very well. He's doing a very good job. And if we can improve the car a little bit more, we can be here a lot more often. And I'm sure he's going to have his fair few times of being here, too.",Great Britain,post-race,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, firstly, I didn’t do it, the crowd did it. Once again, Silverstone put on an amazing show, we’ve got the greatest crowd here. So big, big thank you to everyone for supporting. I felt the energy, I felt the support. This is the reason we got back up there. Also, I just want to say a big congratulations to Lando and to McLaren, where it was my family, where I first started, so to see them back up there, looking so strong. I mean, that thing was rapid through the high-speed corners. Wow. I couldn’t keep up, but we had a good little battle on the restart. The start wasn’t so great for me but the long run on the Medium was really great, so I think this is a good positive for us as a team, to know that we’re not that far away, that we’ve got to just keep on pushing, and we can catch those guys up front. Once he goes through Turn 13 or 14, or 15, he’s gone. So we had good performance in the lower speed – but we had a good little  battle there – I just didn’t have the grunt on the straights. But I’m really happy: to start seventh and come third is a mega, mega job, so big Thank You to my team: great pitstops, great work all weekend, and I love this crowd. It continues to be an honour for me to race and represent all of you. We’re going to continue to push, thank you for the support, and I hope you had a great day today. Thank you so much and God bless. You know he’s serious when he puts the ‘F’ in front of it. Have you seen your videos? Well, firstly, congrats to Max and, and especially Lando, because it was great to see…  it was a great battle we had but it's really amazing to see the McLaren back up in competitive form. I think it's been such a long time. So, and then for me, I really didn't expect to be on the podium today. But when we go through all the different strategy options, this is the one you hope for, which is the Safety Car. I basically put on the Medium tyre in the hope and plan to just stay out on them until the very end, until the Safety Car potentially would come, and fortunately it did. So our a long run pace is really good and really grateful for the team for continuing to push. We do have a lot of work to do on our car to put ourselves in proper competitive form to fight the  Red Bulls and now McLarens. I can't tell you the actual words I was thinking, but it was a one of the worst opening laps that I've had for a while. So I think, ultimately, just trying to gather my thoughts and calm down and not be erratic, but I had a relatively decent start and then into Turn 3 just seemed to lock the rears for some reason. I think we had a tail wind into there and for me, I just kept snapping and went wide and the same thing happened and then the same into Turn 6 and Turn 7. It was very tricky on the first lap but then after that, just try to find my feet. And the Ferraris were pretty quick so it wasn't easy to catch them and overtake but put us in a good position. But the most impressive part was at the end following him (Lando). Honestly, it was just… it was nice... it was amazing to watch how good his car was in high speed. And I know that we've got some work to do to catch up. Yeah, I threw it up the insight into Turn 7 in the hope that I can finally... this is the moment that I'm going to make it happen and I pressed the overtake button… Did you press the overtake button? So we’re both going down the road with the overtake but he had less drag so I guess he said they had a smaller wing and they just started pulling so I had to back out. But I was relatively quick in the first half of the lap and I think if you look at our qualifying laps, we were very, very close to Max all the way until… I think it's until Turn 13 and then that's where they pull all their time. So we've got some work to do to improve our high speed performance. Yep. Yes, 100% and last week. But this is the first time in a long time and they deserved to have the performance they have, as I said, so we've got to do a better job. They've now done a better job than us and looking forward… What I would say is that this is one of the most exciting times I think we've seen in the sport where we're finally starting to see the regs pull people closer. You've seen the Williams was up there with Albon. You've seen the McLarens now, the Astons so we have a lot of teams getting very, very close: small gaps within qualifying which is exactly what we need. So I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the year evolve. Yeah, once again, he is very talented, naturally, as you can see and I think is great when you can have close battles like that and rely on the driver that you're competing with to be fair and hard but fair and so there was never an element or a moment where we thought we were going to come together or anything like that. And then that's what motor racing is all about. As he wanted to hold onto second, I wanted to get that second but it wasn't meant to be today. So we just get our heads down and keep pushing and hopefully we'll have some more battles moving forward. Yeah, I mean, just knowing what it's like to be on the Hards on the restart at the end with someone on the Softs behind, I knew that it would be difficult. I hadn't, obviously, had any running with the McLarens. So I had no idea how strong they were earlier on in the stint, or in the race. And it wasn't until that moment that I started to see some of their strengths and see them get stronger and stronger over the laps. So I threw it up the inside and I tried to get past. But we have a little bit more drag down the straights and then through the high speed, as I said, as he mentioned, that's where they were just murdering us. So difficult, but it was fun for those first few laps. I wish we could have stayed in that close battle for many more laps, but it wasn't meant to be. I look forward to hopefully having some more of those battles in the future. How old were you? Eight? Yeah, definitely yesterday was not the greatest feeling at the end. I think, ultimately, because we'd had a really bad race, obviously, in the previous week. And we knew we had an upgrade coming here, so we were all very hopeful of the step that we were going to hopefully try to take this weekend and bring us in closer and to our disappointment it didn't take us that step, unfortunately, and for us to be sixth than seventh just, ultimately, wasn't a great feeling. Just knowing how hard everyone's worked, and everyone was feeling it in the team. But I think overnight just obviously you have to turn that negative feeling into a positive, which we often do and work on our positives, which is that we had good long run pace that showed on Friday, and just get your head down. Yeah, but after I went down to P9 at the start, I honestly didn't feel too good either. But I had some fun trying to come back through. And hats off to the team for our strength on the race day. And as I said, I didn't expect to be on the podium. So this is mega to be able to share with these guys.",Great Britain,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Thank you. It’s been quite a crazy qualifying. It’s been quite hectic and also quite slippery in some places. But yeah, we did our laps, and then Q3, I was quite surprised to see them two there, it’s great for McLaren to be here as well, and from our side, very happy, of course to be on pole. Yeah, especially Q1, Q2, there were still a few damp spots and you had to be a little bit careful. Of course, you push close to the limit, but knowing that we have a quick car, you don’t need to go to the 100 per cent limit. And then in Q3, when we just go for it, I think that’s where we eked out the gap a little bit. But still, it was not a very big gap today – but for us, great day and looking forward to tomorrow already. Yeah, I think mainly in Q1. I arrived to Turn 15 the first time, I just went straight off. So, it was very weird because Turn 15 and 16, they were a bit damp and it was very difficult to see where exactly: you could only really feel it. So that took a bit of time to really get on top of. I think in general I was just trying to get the laps in. Of course, we knew that we had a quick car, so you don't risk it all the way to get through, but still, that final lap. Of course I had my little incident in the pits, where I destroyed my front wing. Yeah, had a bit of understeer out of the box. Too much rear grip, so yeah, had to new front wing but that meant of course that I was in the back to start that final run, and that was quite exciting, I think, that out-lap, with passing a few cars here and there, to get the lap in but luckily it was all good enough. But that shows that it can also very quickly fall the other way and you’re out. Q2 was just building up, track was getting better and better. So, following the track evolution, and then in Q3, basically the same thing. I think the lap itself was alright, just probably in some places I got caught out a little bit with suddenly, like, an increase in understeer and stuff. But I guess, with the conditions we had, it was anyway going to be quite tricky to have, let's say, a perfect lap out there. In general, like in most places, you could. Just the last sector, 16, 17 was still not like FP3 or whatever, FP2 – but it was good enough. There was definitely a bit more of a dry line coming lap after lap. It's great to see both of them up here. Yeah, great result for their team. And also, where they started off in the year, to see them here it's quite impressive as well. So yeah, very happy for them and hopefully of course they can also have a very strong race tomorrow. No, it was just on the out lap. I had very cold tyres, because most of the people in front of me had new tyres but I stayed on my used set. So yeah, I just tried to get by. But of course he was trying to warm the tyres. So it took a bit of time to find a bit of space to go through. To hit the wall in the pit lane? I think I’m scared to drive out of my box now! No, it has nothing to do with confidence. My engineer asked me what happened. I said I understeered. It happens. The last time that I hit a wall proper was here a couple of years ago, so these things happen. A parking incident? I mean, I've crashed once before in the pit lane, but not in F1. Yeah, it looks a bit interesting, right? But yeah, it’s just a hand injury. Yeah, that's why I said it looks quite interesting, right? But yeah, I injured my finger – it’s not making it better - injured my finger and my hand at the same time but it's fine when I'm driving it’s OK.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Very, very, very happy. I mean, what a qualifying session –almost out in Q1 and then the car was a rocket ship in Q2 and Q3, I feel like I put a pretty good lap together. Massive result for the team as well. You know, to consistently have both of us up here is a mega result. Now we're just got to try and stay there for tomorrow. I think yesterday, we had a bit of a rough day. I think we were a bit quicker than what we looked, just struggling to get the car in the right window. And I think we did a better job of that today. I think this conditions as well, we do really well in them all the time. Barcelona was a similar story; Monaco; Canada as well. So, we've had a fair few moments like that but yeah, to pull that off in Q3 like that was a mega result and obviously both of us have now got the new bits on our car and they're working very well. So, can’t thank the team enough for continuing to push from where we were at the start of the season to where we are now. It's a massive step in the right direction. Yeah, it's a very special moment, to be in the top three. It's been a couple of years since I've been to one of these press conferences, so it's nice to be back. But no, it's been a great day. Even this weekend, I think, you know, we thought we could get into the top 10 at least, but yeah, when the conditions were looking like they were, it's generally been pretty solid for us previously. So you know, I think we went in quietly confident that we could pull off something pretty special. And we've managed to do it. So yeah, very nice to be back. And yeah, happy with the lap I did. There wasn't too much left out there. So I'm happy to be in the top three. It's always tricky. I think we've had about four of those sessions this year. So I think we're all getting good practice with it. But, you know, those conditions, I think most drivers really enjoy them. They're always tricky to get right. You need to find where the grip is on the track. Like Max was saying, sometimes you couldn't see where the grip was, you just had to kind of pray that you were on a dry bit of track. But I really enjoy those conditions. And so does our car it seems. So, yeah, I think we did a good job managing on the team side, I think when it comes to Qualifying, nine times out of 10 we do a very good job with that. So, full credit to the team for the calls today and also for the car as well. Clearly it was working well today. I mean, firstly, stay in the points, that would be good. I think we'll have to see what our race pace is like, you know. Lando showed last week that we can hang on in the races now to a much better extent. So hopefully we can try and do the same tomorrow. Of course, staying in the top three will be tricky with quite a few quick cars behind us. But definitely a solid points score can be on the cards. Yeah, I think very similar comments. The car’s clearly a good step forward. I think with that in mind, we saw in Barcelona in similar conditions with the old spec car that we could also challenge for the front. So, I think, again, I don't want to be negative, but I feel like there's a little bit in that, but I think generally we are more consistently further up the front now. As Lando said, the car doesn't feel too much different, and I think we still have some weaknesses we want to address. But overall, it's faster. And if I was to choose a car that feels great, or a car that goes fast, I would choose one that goes fast and worry about the handling later. So yeah, the team has done a very good job bringing all the new bits this weekend and last weekend. So yeah, excited for the future and hopefully we can have a few more days like this. Yeah, it's a massive confidence boost, but I think regardless of the end result I feel like I did a good lap. I've made a few mistakes in Q3 through the year so it's nice to have a solid lap on the board and to have it for P3 as well as is even better. So, yeah, gaining more and more confidence every time I get out on track and more experienced, obviously. But yeah, it's just nice to be fighting for much higher positions now. There's only two more spots left for today but I'll try to keep pushing. There's things I still need to work on and I think over one lap the pace this year has generally been pretty solid when I haven't made any mistakes. The races, I still need to figure a few things out which will come with time. So that's a big focus, but I'm very happy at the moment to be up here in P3.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"It’s always Max, he always ruins everything for everyone! No, I’m very happy. Big thanks to the whole crowd here. It's been a very special day for us. So, I look forward to tomorrow. It makes up for everything, you know? All the hard work that we've been putting in, especially here. With the new livery for the home race, for the team, for myself. We couldn't have had a better result today – apart from Max again, he ruins everything – but yeah, the rest was pretty amazing. So big thanks to everyone. Oh yeah? I mean, I was watching… There are a lot of TV screens around the circuit so I was trying to watch every single one possible and I was surprised how long I was up the top for but it just kind of depended on when Max was going to cross the line so… I guess I’m a little bit surprised. I wasn't expecting for us to be here or for myself to be here anyway. I think we're very happy with the result. But it was more if Max made a mistake rather than if we were quicker than him. He’s doing a very good job. The team are doing a very good job from his side. I put a good lap in. No mistakes. It was a much cleaner run than my Q3, run 1. But it was a good Quali, you know. I think P1 in Q1. I think P1 in Q2 and almost P1 in Q3 but not quite. But I'm so happy with that. I don't think expectations were low. And I guess in Qualifyings like this, when it's wet/dry, it's always very difficult to anticipate what's going to happen in the whole thing. Some quicker cars were knocked out earlier on, so I think that opened up some opportunities for us to be sitting here. But my Friday just wasn't that great. FP3 was obviously a bit tricky with the conditions, so I didn't have the most confidence all weekend but I managed to pull it out when it matters so I'm happy with it. We don't talk about Barcelona anymore, OK! I think if we look to Austria, Austria is a very different circuit to this. But in Austria we performed extremely well in Qualifying and we managed to back it up a reasonable amount in the race. So I want to be hopeful. I'm not normally hopeful going into a Sunday, because of how this year has been and how things normally go or certain tracks come Sunday. But yeah, I’ve got some reasons to believe and some hope after our pace today, and how we were on Friday and some [of our] times, then we can have a good race tomorrow. Probably not enough to race this guy, but enough to put up a fight for, hopefully, a top five. I think it's definitely clear that we made some improvements. I think that's very, very evident. But I don't want to look forward to the bad races, there's going to be a couple, because there's definitely tracks that we know we're going to struggle more at. I think these have been tracks where our strengths have really come through. High speed, we've made the car probably a little bit more efficient at times. But high speed is one of our strengths and we have quite a bit of that here. We've also improved the car, so the overall balance or not the actual balance, but the overall speed and performance has just taken a decent step forward. But yeah, I guess if I was going to be negative, there are definitely going to be some tracks that we are going to struggle more at. Our weaknesses are still the same and quite weak. So I think we really need to try and tackle them if we want to be able to be here more consistently. But the last few tracks have been relatively high speeds, fast flowing tracks, which are good for us. But we've taken a step forward. I do have to say big thanks to the team because it's been a long beginning of the season, but days like this and like we had in Austria it really feels like you pay them all back for the hard work and the things they've been doing back in the factory. So yeah, we'll keep pushing and will try to stay here often. I wouldn't say it was the opposite way around (sic). I think something that we're… I'll agree with that. Let me start with that. I think me and Max are very good friends. I guess we’ve kind of grown up, not exactly together, we've never really raced against each other until Formula 1, but we've grown up in a similar generation, similar times and I think we've always got along. I think certain mentalities are similar in terms of we’re here because we love it, we want to enjoy every minute that we're here in the paddock and driving cars that we love to drive. But as soon as you put the helmet on, you forget about everything else and I think we have the correct amount of respect away from the track, where you can get along and be mates, whatever it is. It’s not like we see each other every day or text each other every day but we get along and sometimes bump into each other, go for dinners or go for a crepe whatever it is. But at the same time, when you put the helmet on, there's nothing more than, I'm sure, that he wants to do than just beat everyone and make everyone look silly and it’s the same the opposite way around. But you don't do anything differently, most likely, when you get in the car because we get along off track. I think we have the mentality of, you're driving you forget about everything and off the track, you've got a good amount of respect for each other. So you can keep those two quite separate. But I'm sure if Max seems to be aggressive or do things that don't look friendly, then he'll do them, and I'm sure when my time comes – probably not going to be tomorrow – but when our time comes that we're racing for things and we're racing for wins or championships then sure it will get put to the test a little bit more. It's like 70/30, 70% not fixed, 30% fixed just by making the car quicker, adding load and having a better performance. I think 70% at the minute… if we just had more load, more of it will be covered but it's not the whole solution. I think days like today prove that we're not miles away on certain things. It's just some characteristics and handling that I would still say we've had as an inherent issue over the last five years, that we definitely still struggle with. There's still very good things that we've been able to carry through such as high-speed performance. I think since I joined in 2019, we've always been good at certain tracks like this and Austria and things. So there's plenty of things to work on and I think if we really can tackle those bigger problems, which are more fundamental and not just by adding load, then I'm confident we can have a much more competitive car from race one to race in 2024 next year, or ‘23 this year. So plenty of good things but yeah, there are still some issues that we know of and are trying to tackle but it's complicated, takes time, but everyone's working extremely hard and if we can make progress, like we made over the last few races with those certain things over the next five, six months and into ‘24, then I'm confident we can be a lot more competitive and fighting for some podiums and wins at some point.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Alex Albon,"Well, I actually grew up around this area. I learned my ARKS test, which is how you get your racing licence, I did it here. So you could say this was the very start of my racing career. I learned how to drive. They asked you what does your right foot do? What does your left foot do? All that stuff. I don't know what I said. I'm sure I said it correctly. I said right foot is go and left foot is brake. They ask you about the flags as well. No track limits there though… Well, firstly, obviously, high speed is where it stands out. It's also very windy here. I feel like around this kind of circuit, where it is quite open, and I'm sure these guys will agree with me, but wind is very difficult to master in tracks like here, where tailwind, headwinds, it’s changing the balance so much, so to be on the limit throughout the whole corner, it's very easy to underdrive a part of the corner which has a bit of a headwind and you can use a little bit of that wind to push a little bit more into a corner. So, yeah, that's really it. To be honest with you, I think Austria was still a great weekend for us. I just think Canada was a super weekend. So we were still happy with Austria. The pace was great. I think, you know, during the whole weekend our worst result was 13th, which was the Sprint race. And even then we were running in seventh. So I have to say, as a team, we're confident. We feel like with this new package we're in a good place. There is no secret that the last couple of circuits have suited us a little bit more than the ones we're going to go to. Silverstone? Maybe not quite as good as Canada and the Red Bull Ring, but still good. So let's see. I think Lewis summed it up very well. I think there is possibly quite a high chance of something happening this weekend. But we just have to wait and see and obviously more than anything, with the sport that we do, it is a bit of a concern just purely because… I think a pitch invasion is one thing but obviously with cars and moving parts and all this kind of thing, it gets a bit more dangerous to some extent. So yeah, I think on that side we're still yet to have a meeting with the FIA about what would happen in a circumstance like that but, yeah, we just have to be prepared for it.",Great Britain,thursday,Williams
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, good afternoon everyone. So happy to be back. This Grand Prix is the best. Well, I remember coming here the first time when I was a lot younger, racing cadets. I think it's around like the Brooklands area, they had, like, straw bales. I remember crashing. It wasn't a good race. But then, racing, coming here for my first time in Formula Renault. And coming and watching the race, I think, for the first time – I must have been like 13, or 14 or something – with McLaren, and just standing at the back of the garage, dreaming of one day being in the car, and then getting into formula one and having the first year and it's been phenomenal journey that I've had here. I remember the crowd the first time, in 2007, when I got the pole. I think that's probably the only time I've ever heard the crowd over the sound of the car. So that's pretty special. I wish it was worth half a second, because we really need that right now! I mean, I hope so. I think it's hard to quantify. I think, overall, the crowd just lifts you and the whole team up. And there's this kind of feeling of floating when you come here on that positive energy that everyone brings, and just seeing so many flags, so many caps and people supporting us. It really just helps spur you along. And when you're in the car as well, when you see them, you can see them through so many of the corners on the outside of the circuit and it's really just really encouraging. And I always remember my first win here, just continuously being encouraged by the crowd on the outside of Abbey and so… Yeah, so we have a new front wing. So it's just one step, hopefully, further in the right direction. It's not a huge, huge package or anything like that. But we're just [going] step by step, hopefully trying to close down the gap. Obviously, Austria was not a nice weekend for us all. But that's where we learn the most. That's when we pull together the most as a team. So, I was in the factory on Tuesday and Wednesday with the team. And everyone's back in, flat out, just focused on turning that negative into a positive here this weekend. No, no, that's not what I'm thinking. Before the end of the season we will be already well into the contract. I still have 100% faith in this team. And it has taken longer for all of us to get to where we want to be. And it's definitely not easy. But I believe that we will get there. I think we’ve just got to continue to work and chip away at it. And that's what we're trying to do. That's why we've got the upgrade here for the front wing, we will have bits over the following races, hopefully. It could come soon enough. But I'm pushing as hard as I can. I was having big meetings with the team earlier this week, speaking to the head of aero, to the head of vehicle dynamics, trying to… Also with what's in mind for next year’s car. There's not much more I can say apart from what I've already told before. It was really exciting to see… I just saw Jerry walking in. I haven't been to see the garage yet. But I know, on the other side, I was here a week or two before Austria, watching Brad practice. And it's massively exciting to see it all coming together. And to know that we're finally starting to film this weekend, it's like there's nerves naturally, because it's something we've been working on for so long. And we want everyone to love it and to really feel that we encapsulate what the essence of this sport is all about. So that's our goal. I hope we can do you proud. I was just watching on the wall. So I don’t know… I mean, he was just coming by flat out. But we did do a day together at a track in LA. And yeah, he drove… For someone that hasn't raced, he's definitely already got a keen eye. He loves watching MotoGP, so he's always been a racing enthusiast. So he already had a knack for the lines. And he was definitely fully on it, which is good to see. Yeah, I've been really incredibly grateful to them. I don't know if this would have been possible 10 plus years ago, when the old management was in place. They wouldn't have perhaps seen this as an important step in terms of the sport’s growth. But we've already seen the great work and impact of the Netflix show and I think this will take it to new heights beyond that. So yeah, I think there's so many people around the world, as you've seen already, that are so excited about this sport, wanting to learn more. And the fact that we will have all the original characters that are actually on the grid, and then Brad, is pretty cool. I'm pretty certain, I mean, our cameras are a lot better than what you're seeing when you're watching TV. I've seen all the footage of the camera positions. I've spent time with Joe, trying to make sure we've got the best camera positions and the frame rate is different, it's going to look fast. I think it's going to look faster than it does on TV. Because I think it's something to do with the frame rate that we have to have. But Joe is an incredible director, and I think you're going to see him really… You’ve already seen what he's done with fighter jets, what is what he did with Maverick. So just think about what he's done with that in terms of the dogfights you saw from those jets, which was pretty epic. And bringing that technology and that viewpoint into our world, I think it's going to be amazing. I mean, we've not yet spoken with the FIA in terms of what we would have to do. But naturally, we're really hoping that we've learned a lot from last year’s experience and that won't happen this weekend. I believe we have 100 more marshals this weekend, who are there to be supportive and make sure that this doesn't happen as well. And I think, at least from my perspective, and I think my team’s, we are very, very focused on sustainability. We believe in what people are fighting for. And we are making those changes as a sport. But safety is key. We don't want to be put in harm's way and we don't want to put anyone else in harm's way. So if there is if there was to be one, we hope that it's not on track On your first point, yep, that’s correct, and then on the second part, the best thing about our partnership is that we can be direct with each other and Toto is just an out-and-out racer, so he was just trying to encourage me. That was his way of doing it. We always learn from our experiences. On my side, I’ve reviewed my comments and where I was at mentally and will make sure I adjust that for the future, and yeah, it was supportive. Yep. I support peaceful protests, so… yeah. Not much more for me to add to that. It’s very much the same. It wouldn’t be helpful for us to just stop working on this car and focus on next year’s car. We’ve got to utilise the time we have to track to develop the car that we have and fix those problems, just as Charles was saying. And I’m confident we will get there. It’s just a question of how long that will take. I don’t really know what to say. I’ll need to look into it. I think it’s definitely devastating to see that we’ve lost two youngsters in such a short amount of time – but I do trust the FIA, have done such a great job with safety. I know that’s such a focal point for them, they make so many changes, year-on-year at every circuit and I’m sure they’ll be looking very much into Eau Rouge and seeing if we can improve that. And, I agree, we do need to make some changes: you’re coming over a hill , you can’t see,  particularly in the bad weather condition, and this has happened now twice. So, we definitely need to take a step. I miss going there a lot. I’ve always enjoyed the trips out to Shanghai and the fan base there was continuously growing. Even though the race was quite far out of the city, we had, I think, a pretty decent turnout. I don’t really know why I had so much support there but very much enjoy driving that track. I’ve had some difficult races and some amazing races on it. It is an amazing circuit, so exciting to get back there for sure. Well, firstly, Brad looks like he’s aging backwards, so, I mean, he looks great for his age, and of course that was a big topic at the beginning when we were discussing the original… the first story. He’s super-fit, he’s been training, and I think with… at the end of the day, it’s a movie, so there will be a Hollywood element to it that will make it believable. Brad’s such an iconic actor, he’s always done such an incredible job, so I can’t tell you how excited I am to have Brad Pitt in the Formula 1 movie. It’s incredible. I think he’s going to do a great job.",Great Britain,thursday,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"He did, unfortunately. Not really. But we try and play here and there, whenever we have time. And yesterday was one of those games. Normally I win, but yesterday I didn't. I think since Barcelona really, the feeling is going in the right direction. We couldn't really prove it at any other tracks since Barcelona, but in Austria, the feeling was good, and the pace was a bit better than what we had for the first part of the season. So that was good. I think it shows that there were some steps forward made. However, we shouldn't get carried away. I mean, Red Bull is still a lot in front. And I think this track this weekend will expose a bit more our weaknesses. So we might struggle a bit more than what we've seen in Austria. But it's clear that the feeling and the pace is a step better. I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure. I think, again, during the free practices it’s going to be very important to assess that, to see how much of a difference it is in terms of tyre degradation, if we need to fine tune the car to these new constructions. And then we'll see. But we don't know yet whether it's going to be a benefit or a weakness. I grew up watching Formula 1 and obviously Lewis was a part of the drivers always on top and fighting for Championships, so he’s definitely a part of me dreaming of becoming a Formula 1 driver one day. And I think of what he’s doing now. He’s going over the ‘only a driver’ kind of thing and he’s doing many more things outside of Formula 1 that are helping Formula 1 to expand even more – so it’s great to have him. Having said that, whenever I put on the helmet, Lewis is a driver like every other and I try to beat him as much as they others. But it’s great to have him on the grid. I think it’s amazing for the sport. I mean, I am confident in a way that, whenever I’ve been working on something in my career, I’ve always made steps forward – and pretty quickly. And at the moment, this is probably my biggest focus: what can I do as a driver to put the tyres always in the right window, coming into these conditions. This is probably the factor that is over everything else, so there’s been a lot of work on that, and I am confident I did steps forward, yes. I’m not particularly worried, it’s part of the game, no? Whenever you have an edge in one season, then obviously the risk for the other teams is that this team is trying to take time in order to develop next year’s car. But, in the end, it’s quite linked, in a way. We are still mainly focussed on this year’s car because we’ve got clear weaknesses and we know that we need to address those, and when we will have addressed those, then it goes together: next year’s car will be much better – so, yeah. But again, what gives me confidence in this time is that we have a very clear plan in what we want to improve. We’ve already done steps forward in the last three races. There are many more things coming in the next races, in order to not only be in front of Mercedes and Aston but to be fighting the Red Bulls as quickly as possible and we are on the right track, I’m sure.",Great Britain,thursday,Ferrari
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, very true. Thanks for reminding me of that. But yes, it's usually a good weekend for us. It's usually a track that I really enjoy, that I've been driving well on. And it's been just a fun weekend as a whole. I think it's the home of motor sport, you know, when you come to the UK. I spend quite a lot of time here in general, working with the team around Oxford, and it’s a bit of a home race for all of us. Yeah, we're going to see where we are exactly. I think Apex GP is bringing some upgrades this weekend. Sonny Hayes is in good shape. So we're going to see how that works. Yeah, I think we've worked well on bringing, you know, parts for both cars. So yeah, we're having a front wing this weekend. That should be helping our performance in general. So we're going to test that this weekend. I've been listening to what Lewis was saying and reading in the press as well. And I'm sure the movie is in good hands, you know, with Lewis. Obviously scared that it always goes too far in one direction. But I think, you know, with Lewis on board advising everything that's needed to keep how our sport should be is definitely interesting. And I just love racing movies, motor sport movies, and I can't wait to watch it. I think there needs to be a review on everything that happened. It is a tragedy. The weather conditions are the things that makes these conditions very tricky. It’s not like there’s only 20 cars in those championships, there’s more than 30. I’ve been in that position in the past, at the back like that, and not seeing anything, and the visibility is the main factor in that race. And for most of us, we drive blind in those moments, so I’m sure the FIA is looking into it, to try to improve the situation. I think we have some mudguard tests here next week, or pretty soon, which is supposed to help visibility. The issue is that we should not learn the hard way, this way. And yeah, it’s a very sad moment for motorsport.",Great Britain,thursday,Alpine
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yes, probably one of the worst races of this year. But I just forget those. But I learned a lot of things from that race. So it's good. I think it just makes this race a [chance to] refocus again. I think we will also bring quite a good amount of upgrades. So looking forward to that. Hopefully that works well. And in that case, I will just try to maximise that opportunity and aim for the points. In Austria it was a bit of everything. We are having too much drag. So currently, just really, straight line speed is really poor, but at the same time, because we don't have much downforce, we don't have much load. We want to put downforce, but if you put downforce, the drag is going to be worse. So we need less drag. At the same time more load, so a bit of everything. These kind of upgrades will bring us a little bit different approach, which, of course, in general, load as well, but a bit of difference. So yeah, I'm feeling optimistic, I think. Yeah, in the data and simulator, I feel quite good. So, yeah, I just have to try it on track and see how it works. So, the first time I saw him, I was seven years old when I went to the Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji. My friend, a karting friend, was driving with his helmet, like with his replica. So, I can’t still believe I’m driving with him but he’s obviously, like Charles says, been fighting for Championships every year. Unfortunately, we’re not driving together, in the same field right now. We’re in different positions, I don’t feel like we’re driving similar… we’re driving in the same race but I don’t feel… but it’s definitely cool and I still can’t believe that 12, 13 years after I’m driving with him. Every time I see him in the track, it just feels exciting. Feels definitely not real – at the same time I’m really honoured and happy that I’m able to run with him.",Great Britain,thursday,RB
Lando Norris,"I’m super-excited. Finally, my home race for the season. So, yeah, I’m feeling good: we’ve come off the back of a very good weekend, I probably couldn’t have asked for a better weekend to come into my home race. Excited, some more things to look forward to this weekend – but just, I guess, the rest of it. Not the driving part – the driving part I’m always excited for – but the rest of the weekend, the fan stage on Sunday night, probably the thing I look forward to the most already, so yeah, I look forward to the whole thing. I’m hoping for something similar. I don’t expect it really to be any better, but I think that’s still me remaining positive. I’m still looking forward to it. We definitely took a step forward, we caught up with some of the competition, we overtook a lot of the competition – but Austria has always been our best race of the season, like by quite a way, so I think we can try to maintain that pace this weekend – that’s our aim – doing any better than that is a bit of a stretch but we’re definitely getting there. A couple of little things on the car this weekend that we can add to it. If we can just start to consolidate these positions, or this area that we’re racing in, then I’ll be happy. But it’s close. If we can race against Mercedes and Aston this weekend, I’ll still be happy. The whole season we’ve been a little bit up-and-down. Some tracks, the car works very well and some tracks not so much. We made the car quicker. We didn’t make it any easier to drive, and I think that’s our next target to try to achieve. But like I said, Austria’s our best race, so I don’t think it’s going to get much better – but you never know. This weekend we’ll try to do better, but just try to maintain that area that we’re racing in. If we can race against Astons, I think we’d still very happy; if we can race against Mercedes, I think we’ve still be very happy. But even doing that I think is quite a big ask still. If there’s one place in the whole season that I’d love to do it more than anything, then it’s here. As much as I would love any podium, or any win, whatever it is, the one place I would love to do it – even over Monaco and all of those special places – the home race for me is the one place I’d love to do it. So, I guess I’ve grown up watching Lewis do well here and it be one of his most competitive circuits, you see what it means to him and at the same time, what it means to the fans, and the supporters who are there, cheering the Brits on, so if I and we as a team can deliver a good result for the home fans, that would make it even more special. Yeah, depends if Lewis keeps it within the track limits! I'm hoping for a fight. I think if we can fight with Mercedes we'll be happy. I think last weekend Mercedes just had a pretty tough weekend. Through the rest of it they've been quicker than us in every single race this season, in Qualifying. If we can race with Mercedes, I think it would be good, not just for our own pace and facts, but also for the fans, because that's the majority of the Brits. Of course we’ve got Alex there as well. But I want to say me, I want to be confident in saying me. I think after FP1, FP2 we will be able to get a good read on where we stand and if it's close enough to Mercedes, then I'm looking forward to Sunday, so you can come out on top. I think we understand the reasons why we were particularly good in say Monaco and Canada-ish, why we were competitive there in the rain. I think we know why it worked, where we're very strong and where we're struggling a lot more. And some of them kind of go hand-in-hand and then provide the reasons for why we were also strong in a wet but I wouldn't say we were outstanding last weekend when it started to rain in the Sprint race[LS1] . Certain places we were strong, but certain things we really did struggle with so…I don't know. I think we have to wait and see how we just perform on this track. We’ll see how Friday goes then I'll be able to understand if we can be a good contender in the wet or not. But I always enjoy those conditions. We had them last year and Qualifying went well so I don't mind but for the fans, I want to say I hope it stays dry. I hope. I said in an interview the other day…I'm a driver at the end of the day but you have to accept what people want to do in certain situations and I understand it in certain situations, but it’s just something that I don't think…It can't happen at a racing event like what we have here. If it happens in – and I hope it doesn't - but it happens in the paddock and things like that, I guess that probably causes different scenarios. But it just can't happen on a race track because you put actual people's lives in danger. I guess not just the people who are doing it on circuit, I don't know if they realise the consequences of what can happen but the consequences would be pretty extreme. So I don't know. I kind of think it's best not to think of it but it's happening more and more, it seems.  They have the right to do it and so forth but there's a time and a place and that just needs to be understood because it also causes consequences for the people who are on track driving such as us. I don’t know really, but at the end of the day it just can't happen on track. I think it's quite simple. If it does then the consequences separately should be pretty severe, I would say. I think it's great. I think to be part of…I don't know if we're really going to be in it that much, but to be part of something I think is pretty, pretty cool. I know, actually, the stunt double… I forgot his name. Who's the main actor? Yeah, that one! Sorry, my bad…Yes, the stunt double for Brad. The weird thing is, he doesn't have any hair, so I don't know how it really correlates well, but he's the stunt double for the driving scenes. He's been talking about it and saying some things, and it's all sounds pretty cool, looks pretty cool, they’re doing a good job as a big production obviously. Yeah, nice, especially for us to be part of something, whether we're really that involved in it or not but for them to…The garage is pretty nice. Kind of jealous of some of the things that they’ve got. But good for that. I know they're going to be on track driving at certain times and from what I've heard Brad's done a good job as well with the driving and stuff like that. So yes, cool. I just hope they don't ruin our...I think they're joining us on the installation lap on the race from what I've heard, so I just hope they don't ruin that. But yeah, we'll see. I'd say it's about time that we're going to do something. I think as drivers we've said it for years that something needs to be done. I think we've been lucky that nothing has happened within…I’d say Formula 1, or many other categories, and in the worst case, sadly, we've had to lose a life for people to realise that those things can happen and if it could just happen there it could have happened last weekend for us in Austria. It's a shame we had to see such a consequence for people to understand what can happen in any case, but yep, I think it's something that needs to be done. I would say it's the biggest safety concern at the minute within Formula 1, no matter what way you look at it, you just say what's the next thing that can improve safety the most? It's actually being able to see where we're going. That helps sometimes, so yeah, I look forward to it. I'm doing a test so we'll see soon how good it's going to be but if it doesn't work, something else needs to be done to find a solution. Ha, five, six! I've seen it. I’d say 24 is a lot. If I had to put like a perfect number, I would say it's probably closer to 20. But there are too many tracks, there's a lot of tracks that people want to go to and so on. I think Zak’s mentioned it a few times, like 20 is a good number, also for the lives of mechanics, engineers, everyone that travels, they’re away from their families, kids and so on, for so many days, more days than us as drivers are away, so it's tougher for them. So I think when we talk about things, we must speak more as voices for those people than probably for ourselves. Like 20 but then with rotating tracks. Sometimes you want to go to certain places in different years. You just can't go to all the tracks that people want to go to, it’s as simple as that. It's nice to see they've put some effort into organising it in a slightly better way, but still it's a tough calendar, it's one of the longest calendars we've had. As long as they keep trying to improve it and do better but I'd say 20 is a better number for everyone, just for the health and everything of all of the Formula 1 people.",Great Britain,thursday,McLaren
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, for sure, it’s right across the road. So, doesn’t get much more of a home race for the team than this one. It’s great. I mean, just for everyone in the team, lot of guys over at the factory that don’t really get a chance to come, watch some racing very often and see the car this weekend, have a chance to come over and see the car and get a feel for the race weekend, which is cool. And a great track to drive. One that’s always a lot of fun. I don’t think it was our most competitive weekend. We have some ideas why but I think we’re… we have a few upgrades this weekend, a few bits that we’re bringing to the car to try to improve some of the weaknesses that we had in Austria. So, I hope we can be a bit more competitive this weekend. Little bit of straight-line speed, some thru-corner balance issues, and we didn’t look to be as competitive as some of the other teams, and then high-speed corners also, last week. Just wasn’t one of our most competitive weekends but a few bits coming on the car this weekend, so hopefully we can be a bit stronger. Yeah, it's a huge safety issue at the moment and it needs to be addressed. We can’t see anything in heavy wet weather. I can remember Japan last year, I can recall many races over the past few years in Formula 1 where you just cannot see anything when you're behind a car and it's extremely dangerous if someone has an incident in front of you and is sideways in the middle of the track. You can't see where you're going. We shouldn't be racing in those conditions and it's terrible what happened last week. I don't think that race should have gone ahead in those conditions with the layout of that track. And I remember being in that exact situation in Spa where you're coming up on top of Eau Rouge and you're in the middle of the pack and you can't see anything. I don't think we should be racing like that, so it definitely is something that if it works, has to be put on the cars as quickly as possible. And if it doesn't work we shouldn't be putting ourselves in situations where we're racing in conditions where we can’t see. Accidents can happen and they can be really severe accidents. So definitely, if it works, get it on the cars as quickly as possible and hopefully it does work and it's a great solution going forward to wet weather racing. Yeah, I don't have much more to add. But good information from Andrew. I will see tomorrow how they feel. Yeah, it’s incredible. It's incredibly exciting for everyone at AMR. It’s a much better working environment than what we've been in for many years. I also just think it's a really exciting opportunity to grow as a team going forward and to expand and be better and build better cars. It's a great opportunity as a team to grow and move forward.",Great Britain,thursday,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I’m happy I made very good progress. It was a very tough weekend but here we are, fresh and ready. Hopefully not Carlos again! And yeah, hopefully we can have a bit more of a quiet race. It was quite hectic the last weekend. Well, I think it’s possible we are just back to our form we had earlier in the season. I think we just had a bad few races. We understand why now and hopefully we are able to keep this consistency going forwards, until the end of the year, basically. I think it should be a really good circuit for us. The high speed has been our strongest point, so I do expect us to shine, probably – and hopefully a bit more than previous weekends. I think we all know it really well. Not only in Formula 1 but also from the junior categories, doing British F3 for a few years; you do a lot of testing in this circuit, with different configurations, different layouts. I think it’s a place that we all enjoy a lot and know it very well. Numbers, definitely. We keep that consistency through all of them. They like to call them by the name but I think it’s better to keep that consistency. Yeah, I think if they work, I will definitely like to see them put in, certainly Formula 1, although it's going to be quite penalising, maybe more for some teams than others in terms of downforce, but I think it's where it's something that safety should come first and it might allow us to race in more dangerous conditions, especially what has happened last weekend, I think it's something that we got to improve. But for now I think it's just important that race directors let us race only when it's safe, and actually the whole grid is able to see something, I think this tyre construction is done to favour a few teams, so I think someone is going to make it better. I don't know if it's us or another team but certainly there is a characteristic change in the tyre and especially in the highest speed, we feel. So it will be interesting to see what happens also with the degradation because we haven't done much work on that.",Great Britain,thursday,Red Bull
Kevin Magnussen,"Numbers for me as well. I always forget the names. There’s a couple of them I know but I always forget. I think after the couple of races we've had lately, it's not easy to be super confident.  I think our car is often very strong on Saturday, strong on one lap, low fuel, new tyres but in the race on Sunday we seem to struggle a lot more than others. So that's what we're focusing on at the minute. And trying to improve the situation on Sunday, when we have to do more than one lap on the tyres. Well, first phase is investigating what actually is causing our issues. We seem to just have a lot of degradation, lap time degradation. It's not like we're graining the tyres or damaging the rubber, it seems to just lose performance more than others. So we can qualify well but then we would seem to just travel down the field in the race. So that's not a great situation. I prefer it to be the other way around: to have a strong car on Sunday and you can fight your way forward.  At least you have something to fight for on Sunday, but at the moment it's a bit of a tough situation. Yeah, I think it's definitely one of the highest speed circuits of the year and I'm hoping that we can have a bit more strength here. I think our car seems to be pretty strong in high speed corners and it's a very low braking circuit so maybe that's going to be interesting for our problems, to see if that has an effect that we're not using the brakes so much. But yeah, we'll see. I don't think it's a stat that in itself is something to be…  Well, I guess, at the end of the day, getting to Formula 1 was a dream that I had for many, many years. And if you'd told me as a 10-year old kid that I'd be 10 years in Formula 1, that would have been something to be proud of back then and it still is now but I think when you're here, you're dreaming of bigger things and the next big thing, so I don't think it's the number that… I don't hope it's the number I'm going to remember for my Formula 1 career for but we'll see. I don't think I can say much that hasn't already been said. But I agree with Lando, it's the next biggest thing right now. I feel very safe enough in a Formula 1 car in all situations but this one, when you can't see, it feels a million times more…It feels ridiculous, when you're doing those speeds and you might as well close your eyes. There's zero visibility, and it would be great if that could be improved significantly. Yeah, I've known Frederik since he was a little kid. He was good…I think he still is good friends with my little brother, and they went karting together back in the day. And, now, Frederik is one of the leading youngsters outside of Formula 1, I would say, and he's doing a great job leading the championship in F2 and showing great consistency and maturity. I think the whole of Denmark is very excited for him and about him and hopefully there'll be a spot in F1 for him in the future.",Great Britain,thursday,Haas
Valtteri Bottas,"It's quite hard to remember all the moments in detail.  Probably, I think, I would go for the 2014, that was pretty sweet year overall but in any case, every time if you're privileged to get on the podium it’s a really cool situation, obviously. Definitely needed, these upgrades, and the whole factory has been working flat out to get two sets of those for this weekend. Last weekend in Austria, just overall lacking a bit of pace, and by pace, just no chance of getting into the top 10. So hopefully it will give us a boost and actually it's more like also targeting the high-speed nature of corners. So yeah, let's see how it goes, going to be interesting tomorrow. I think this weekend is quite important. I think if we can make a step here, then that gives us a lot more confidence for the rest of the season. But we keep fighting. It is so close that any small gain makes a big difference and obviously things are always track dependent as well, so we'll keep working hard. I think this weekend, getting points, ideally with both cars; that would be success at this point. So that's the target. Not so much to add actually, pretty much the same thoughts as what Lando has, that the consequences would be not so nice, so I really hope that people understand that, and like Lando said, there's a time and place for these things and I hope people are smart. I think it's great the test is happening and we always need to find some kind of solutions and just really hope that it helps even a bit but like I said, meanwhile, it is a big issue and we shouldn't be starting races in conditions or any category shouldn't if you basically can't see so that's the big thing. No, all on plan I believe.  It's still obviously far away but I haven't actually heard anything else. So yeah, it should be all good.",Great Britain,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, thank you very much. I think most important for me, of course, was lap one, to stay in front, and after that we could do our own race. Of course, we opted not to box during the Virtual Safety Car and just to follow our normal strategy. And I think that worked out really well, because the tyre life was not that high around here. And I think out stints were perfect. So yeah, great day, I enjoyed it a lot. Yeah, I mean, I could see already in the few laps before the Virtual Safety Car came out that we were pulling out quite a gap. So I knew that I would get them back eventually. And I think just following our own plan, I think, at the time, was the best way forward. I don't like to think about that. I'm just enjoying the moment driving this car, working with the team. I think the whole weekend we have done a really good job. You know, a Sprint weekend is always very, very hectic and a lot of things can go wrong. And luckily, a lot of things went right for us this weekend. So I'm just very happy with this weekend and we'll focus again on Silverstone. I mean, it's an incredible support every time we come here and to see all the orange in the grandstands, the flares as well at the end, incredible atmosphere. So thank you very much for coming. Yeah, it's been a pretty incredible weekend, of course, something I didn't expect. But with the Sprint format, normally, it's always a bit more chaotic to get on top of everything. But I think we did everything well as a team. Also today, I think with the strategy, with the pit stops, everything was smooth. And out there on the track we just had a very quick car and I felt comfortable in the car. And we could do everything we wanted, like we planned it. That wasn't planned! To me not, but to the team, I think they were a little bit more nervous. But I mean, I saw the gap and I was like ‘we have to pit, I want to go for the fastest lap’. When you have the opportunity, you know… And that's what we did at the end. Maybe. Yeah, but I mean, from the outside maybe it looks like a big risk. But when you're in the car... For me, it didn't feel like a risk at all. Yeah, I mean, it was good but also a little bit unfair. The tyre advantage I had as well and also the general pace advantage. But yeah, I mean, of course, Charles, he knows how to race. You could see that also last year, right, around here. But we were clearly just a bit faster today. Yeah, I mean, you know where the line is, right. But I also had a lot more grip and traction. So for me, I think… I mean, I don’t know, it was not really… It is what it is. It would have been better if you had, like, similar pace, same tyres. You know, you're really fighting for it. I think the battle between Carlos and Checo was better in that sense. Exactly. But I loved all the articles about it! Yeah, I mean, some weekends they work a bit better for you and some don't. And for me, Montréal wasn't that fantastic in the race, from our side. And here, I think we did a really good job and then naturally the gap is a bit bigger. We just stick to our plan. I mean, you have these calculations before, if there's a Safety Car or Virtual Safety Car. And for us, it made sense to just go, because I think we had good tyre life. Already, the few laps before the VSC came out, I was definitely pulling even more of a gap over as every single lap. That's why I wasn't really worried about it. I just completed my stint that I had to do on the Medium. And then, when I came out on the Hard tyre, I immediately felt that tyre was not the better tyre, but you have to complete a stint on it. I mean the Soft, was not going to last, so once I got past Carlos, I just… yeah. The way you manage your stint I was just naturally closing in on Charles because of my tyre life advantage and probably also just a general pace advantage. So yeah, just step by step, catching-up. Yeah, I mean, I've been talking about that as well with the team and I've seen the data already on the simulator as well. To me, it looks pretty terrible. I mean, if you go flat-out on the straight at Monza, I don't know what it is, like four or five hundred before the end of the straight, you have to downshift flat-out because that's faster. I think that's not the way forward. Of course, probably that's one of the worst tracks. But for me, the problem is, it looks like it's going to be an ICE competition, like whoever has the strongest engine will have a big benefit. But I don't think that should be the intention of Formula 1, because then you will start a massive development war again, and it will become quite expensive to find, probably a few horsepower here and there. I think it actually should be opposite. Plus, the cars probably have a lot less drag. So, it will be even harder to overtake on the straight. And then I think yeah, you have the active aerodynamics, which you can’t control. Well, it will be… I don't know… the system will control it for you. Which then I think makes it very awkward to drive, because I prefer to control it myself. Of course, when you're behind someone, maybe you need more front or more rear. These kind of things. If the system starts to control that for you, I don't think that's the right way forward. Plus, the weight is going up again. So yeah, we have to seriously look at this because I mean, ’26 is not that far away. And at the moment, to me, it looks very bad from all the numbers and what I see from the data already. So, it's not something I'm very excited about at the moment. It’s, for sure, quite a dangerous corner but we're also going to Jeddah in Sector 1 and that, for me, is probably more dangerous even because well, I’m happy that nothing has happened yet in that sector because going through (Turns) 6, 7, 8, if you have a shunt there that can be the same – it's all blind, you don't know what's coming. Even with people like impeding and stuff. I remember in the beginning of the year there, I got upset with my engineer because I impeded Lando, I think, and I know how that feels. It’s super dangerous when these things happen. And for sure, in Eau Rouge, going up, it is blind, but of course this accident now happened later. I think the only thing that maybe can be improved there is to make more space in terms of trying to move the barriers more out, because at the moment, it looks like as soon as you crash, you hit the barrier, you bounce back onto the track quite easily. And of course with that scenario, where there is almost no visibility, a lot of water, and that is of course a big issue. I think in the dry, normally, it's a bit better. You see, of course, more of what is going on in front of you. I think already the changes they made in Spa, they definitely opened it up a lot more but it will always be a dangerous corner, but we are going to a lot of tracks where there are dangerous corners, where up until probably there is an accident, you won't say anything. And now of course it gets brought up, but I feel it's a bit unfair to just blame it on the track, because I think in the first place you have to look into why did they restart. It's a big championship, a lot of cars. They are up and coming talents, they probably risk a bit more, because they want to show every race that they are the best driver out there. And with that visibility, it was just impossible to see anything and I know, of course, from your mind when you're going there, you don't see anything. You’re like, well, I guess the guy in front of me is flat so I'm flat. I just stay flat out. And that's exactly probably what happened there. The drivers are just staying flat because they didn't know there was a car in the wall and then another car in the wall later on. So yeah, there are a lot of things that have to come together, what we have to improve.",Austria,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, well, I think, Friday and today we have maximised what we have really. It's more yesterday that I was off the pace. But it's good to be back on the podium. The upgrades that we brought to the car made me feel a little bit better in those conditions, which is looking good for the future. The team has done an excellent job by bringing these upgrades earlier. So that's great. But obviously, there's still a lot of work to do because Max, and Checo too, had a lot of pace. Yeah, we are struggling quite a lot in dirty air. So I was trying to get the track position. Even though we knew that in the long term, for the whole race, it would have been difficult to keep Max behind, with the race pace he had. But I tried and it wasn't enough. But at least it's good to be back on the podium, especially after the last few races that have been a bit more difficult Yeah, together with Austria actually, these are my two favourite tracks that are non-city tracks and in Silverstone we always had great results. So hopefully we can take advantage of the new upgrades we have on the car and be a bit more of a challenge to the Red Bulls. It feels good to be back on the podium, especially after what was a very difficult day yesterday. I had a really good feeling in the car on Friday. I think with the new upgrades the feeling is getting there. And we were really waiting for this race in order to confirm the good feelings we had on Friday. And it worked out. I mean, no secrets, we still need to work extremely hard to catch up Red Bull, who are still quite a lot faster on race day. But the feeling is better. And the team is pushing like I've never seen before in terms of bringing the upgrades much earlier than what was planned. And this is great to see. Overall, we had a more consistent car today, which was good to see. I feel like maybe, like Max was saying, with these sprint weekends, it's a bit more unpredictable, less preparation you have and maybe I was a bit out the window in terms of set-up for this race. I had the rear stepping-out a bit too much and struggling with rear degradation – but on the second and last stint it was a little bit better as I modified my driving, but maybe we left a little bit more of performance there. This is the target, if not doing better. So yes, it is a very different track in Silverstone. And it's going to be very interesting to see where we are there, because I feel like maybe the weakness of the car now is still a little bit, the high-speed corners. And in Silverstone, there are lots of high-speed. So, it will be good to see if this new package helps. Oh, because for me, it was clearly not a three-stop race. At least it didn’t feel like that. And I don't know what was the plan about the other tyre. I don't think we had discussed that, before that. So yeah, I just said no, because I did not feel it was the right decision. Well, I think I'm always motivated especially after weekends like this, where you finally see a bit more potential for fighting in the front. It feels good, then of course, in terms of the championship, I think it's going to be difficult to go and win this championship, but on the other hand, there's still plenty to work on. I see how high the motivation is within the team and how much they are pushing back at the factory again to bring the upgrades earlier and this gives me the confidence and motivation to push whenever I'm on track. And I'm already looking forward to Silverstone. It's a very different track, and again, the team has done an incredible job. So I think we are all flat out to try and be back winning as soon as possible even though we are 150 whatever points behind, a win will feel nice and we are all working towards that target. To be honest, yes and no. Honestly, at that point I knew that it was a matter of time. Max had much fresher tyres, they are also quicker whenever we have the same tyres, so it's not like I tried to push like crazy. I knew it was crucial for me to lose as little time as possible in this battle and this is why I haven't been as aggressive as I've been in all the times when we were fighting for real positions. This one was a bit difficult to… if he wouldn't have overtaken me in Turn 4, it was the lap after, and I would have lost more time for my race so it wouldn’t have benefited me in any way. Yes, for sure, and that's why I'm working as hard as possible. Or at least I feel really good whenever it's full wet or full dry. Whenever it's in the in between, for some reason, with my driving style I'm just too aggressive and it's not working out. So I need to make progress. We are working on it as a team to try and understand whatever we can do with the tools, especially for me to be a bit more at ease, and we’ll see. Yes, I think the first thing to look at is when to start a race and in which conditions we are happy to race and it's safe to race. Second is visibility. I think with our cars, with cars in general, motor sport now, the same… Formula 4, 30 years ago, the amount of spray there was, I'm pretty sure it was less, because the downforce now is more and more and with the spray it’s just going much higher up. And the visibility is just known. And as Max was explaining, you don't see, you are just hoping that the guy in front is flat out and that there is no cars in the middle of the road, but this is not enough. And then the last thing I would say is maybe to consider for these tracks with very, very high speeds, to have the walls further away from the track, so when they lose the car, they don't bounce on the wall and come back on the track. And at least they probably stop more to the left or more to the right but at least they don't bounce back on the track, which is another problem. So these three things need to be looked into. It's obviously horrible what's happened, again.",Austria,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I'm really happy. It's been a very difficult weekend for me personally, physically. I have been really, really weak. I was sick on Thursday. So it hasn't been an easy weekend. You know, high fevers, no sleep during the weekend. So great recovery from the team. A fantastic strategy and we had a great pace. Yeah, it was very hard but fair, like you said, always a pleasure to race them. They were very, very strong, especially in the low speed. They were having very good traction. But it's a good comeback. Yeah, definitely. It's been a bit of a rough patch for me. So now hopefully we are back and we can keep that consistency now. Yeah, it's really nice to get back to the podium, especially at home, such a special weekend for the team and on our weekend that started overall really bad with… I don't know how to say it, I don’t want to use a bad word… but for the track limits, I think everyone got hit by it at some point. Hopefully next year when we come back, it's something that it can be fixed. But anyway, that meant that we started P15 for the race today and we just had to fight our way through it. We had some great pace, some great battles out there but in the end, it's a good one, especially not been close to 100 per cent physically. But with all the adrenaline going on, you forget about everything. I think with the VSC, something that we’ve got to review from the position I was… yeah, something we need to see. Also, the way we did the strategy, when we use the Hard at the end, few things to tickle around, but I think, generally… I mean, I got to back to the podium, so it was a good strategy. I think Carlos and Lewis, both were my biggest fights, so I think Carlos was a bit more enjoyable. I heard that! I haven't spoken to Carlos, I don't know what he means with it. We don't see the face of the other driver. I don't know. I don't know what he really means when it! Not really, I think we just had a proper fight. They were particularly strong, I'd say, in the exit of Three. It took me a bit longer in one occasion, I was down the inside into Turn Four and all of a sudden I find the Haas stopped in the inside, so I had to back off and so it took me probably a bit longer than I wanted but in the end, we got it done. Yeah, certainly. I mean, without the issues we had on Friday, we had good pace since Lap One, we managed to understand our issues we had in the previous races so yeah, I believe that we are back. Yeah, definitely not great. I haven't had a good rest. Every night I've had a fever and I think when that happens and then you are on medications, automatically you are not 100% at all. It's a very demanding sport, in the car and out of the car. I’ve just been really sick, so I really hope that I can recover in a few days, because Silverstone is another very hard, race very demanding so I really need time. I'm really far from 100% at the moment. Yeah, I think first of all, there is room to improve the exit of Eau Rouge still and hopefully we are able to move the barrier back to make sure that there is no car coming back into the track. But to me, the most important one is definitely the track conditions, because I think sometimes race directors are pushed by, probably fans and social media, people sitting back at home thinking that the circuit looks fine to race but the visibility is just the most important. And it's not about the leader or the second place; it's about the 10th, 15th, 20th. Basically, they need to be able to see. So I think it's something that we really need to force other categories and also in Formula 1 to make sure that we are able to race whenever it's safe for everyone to see at least. Accidents can happen but you cannot have situations where drivers are basically blind and just going flat out, because it's when those big accidents can happen in any series. So if that means delaying the start and means that we won't have the start when the track is really wet, then fine. We’ve got to do what is safe for all the drivers.",Austria,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"No, it was very difficult because of all the track limits. You know, we don't do this on purpose. But with these speeds and all these high-speed corners, it's so hard to judge the white line, really. And that's why I think you could see today a lot of people getting caught out, including myself. So honestly, it was about surviving. Even in Q3, like the first lap, you just want a banker lap, which takes out the joy a little bit, but I think it still did a good enough lap. So yeah, very happy with being on pole. But it's still a very long weekend ahead as well. It's always very tricky around here every year, and the cars are big, they are heavy, but yeah, just to judge it on a line this wide with these speeds is incredibly hard. Yeah, I mean, we know that this is quite a different weekend, with the whole format, but of course I’m very happy with today. Tomorrow, again, very different day I think. But at least the car is quick and that's I think the most important. I think it was good enough, but around here to get the perfect lap together it’s not that easy. And plus today, I think, it was very difficult with the track limits as well. You leave a little bit of margin, I think, especially for me in the last sector. But yeah, the lap was fine. It’s just tricky. You have the high-speed corners and the very low-speed corners, and sometimes the balance can be… You want bit more front or whatever for the low-speed, less for the high-speed, it's difficult to always get that right. But yeah, happy of course to be first. I mean, around here, short lap, the margins are very small, we always see that, but to be ahead is good for us. Yeah, I mean, it is, I think one of the worst tracks for it, with the track limits. Also, especially towards the end, the tyres are getting really hot so they're not as agile anymore as well compared to the beginning of the lap. But it's super hard to judge around here. You have all the compressions as well, where if you hit it slightly wrong, the car immediately drops away from you or understeers and then it's super easy to go over the white line. And I think today it looked very silly. It almost looked like we were amateurs out there, the amount of lap times that were getting deleted. And also, some of them were so marginal, where even we spoke about it in the briefing before that, when it's very marginal, it's impossible to judge if it's out or in, and they were still getting deleted. So I don't think it was a good look today. Of course, people can say, ‘Yeah, well, then you just stay within the white lines’. Well, if it was that easy, then you can take my car and try it. But probably you won't even get up to speed in time. But yeah, it is super tricky. And I think today showed that. I think it's still not easy to have a clear rule about it, because on most tracks, it works really well. But on some tracks, you might need something different. Because of course a lot of the tracks we share it with MotoGP or whatever, bike championships in general. And of course, they want something else outside of the kerbs than what we would like. I mean, for us putting gravel there, it's fine. But for a bike, it's a bit different. So we need to think about maybe different solutions. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. So I didn't really think about it. I was already busy enough just getting my car to where it was in Qualifying. And then you know, around here it always is very close. And I think that showed again today. I don't know. I mean, again, it was probably not enough information. But that's the same for everyone, right? So I guess we'll find out. I don't know tomorrow what the weather will do. But on Sunday, we'll definitely find out. Yeah, but also there I was leaving margin, just I ran out of road. I was not on the limit, but sometimes when you hit the compression wrong, you lose the lap time apparently. For me, it was still a very close call. But I mean, of course in Q3, you're going faster than in Q2, but it's just finding your margins. But definitely in Q3 I was a bit more aware of where to put the car not to risk, you know, being looked into. I mean, if you saw the amount of lap times that were getting deleted today by the amount of drivers, it's clearly not that easy. And I don't think we're all idiots out there, right? Normally, we're quite good on how to judge where the limit is, but this track, I think, because of the layout as well and the way the tyres operate – they overheat quite a bit through the lap – it is just very difficult. So yeah, most tracks I think it's fine how we operate it, but some tracks we might need to look into it. But at the moment also had no real answers of how to do that. But I think we've already tried on a few tracks where to paint a bit of a wider white line, which I thought helped a bit because I think the white line in some places is quite narrow with the high speeds we are achieving in that particular corner, so this is maybe something we can look into. Turn 1. Turn 1 also, like there's a yellow sausage. I mean, if you hit that already, and you slow down, but it still puts you out of the white line and your lap time gets cancelled. So yeah, it's not ideal Well, I think the problem is that… We luckily got rid of these stupid yellow kerbs in most of the corners because that was just destroying the car. But the problem is… It can be easily solved by just putting gravel next to the kerbs, but like I said, the bikes don't want that. Then, this track in general, like we all said before, it's just harder to judge the track limit. So it's just a very difficult thing to come up with, because you also don't want the promoters, you know, the track in general, that they put gravel in and have to take it away again, it's costing a lot of money as well, so that's not really a good solution as well. So yeah, it's something we will talk about again in the drivers’ meeting and maybe we can find a solution.",Austria,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it feels good to finally have a clean Qualifying again and to be on the front row, back on the front row. The feeling has been a bit better in the last few races. And then in Q1, Q2, it was all about building up to that lap in Q3 and then I managed to put everything that I wanted in the last lap of Q3. Very close to Max. Not enough today, but overall I don't think we expected to be so close to the Red Bulls. So it's a good step forward. First of all, I would like to thank all the guys back at the factory. I mean, it's only qualifying but the work they've done in the last two or three weeks in order to bring the package earlier than what was planned was really, really impressive and that helped us to have a good performance today. Now we need to confirm that in the race obviously, tomorrow and Sunday. No, it was already feeling quite OK in practice, very difficult to understand. And also everybody is so close. So it was very tricky. It was all about putting everything together and we did it today. So, happy. Yeah, race pace looked quite good in Montréal. But again, consistency is where we need to focus so we really have to see on Sunday if we've got the same pace as in Montréal but Red Bull for now is quicker on race day, so it's going to be difficult, but if we can put them in difficulty we'll do it all. There's always something more. I think Turn 3 was not ideal. Turn 1 had quite a bit of snaps. We tried to add a bit more front wing for the last run in Q3 and it probably was a tiny bit too much. But at the end it’s part of the game. Very, very close to pole position, which is a good sign. But we all know that our weakness is the race. So we are waiting for the race to try and see if we confirm the positive signs that we've seen in Montréal. And as I said earlier, the team has done a great job by putting so much effort into bringing the upgrades earlier than what was planned. And that helped us to have a good feeling with the car today. Again, all the effort is made to make our race pace better. So it is great to be on the front row. It is great to be close again to pole position, or at least to be fighting for it. But on the other hand, we still need to wait, because the points are scored on Sunday. And since the beginning of season that's where the struggles are for us. Tomorrow it’s raining so I don't think there's much we can learn from today to bring to tomorrow. But yeah, it will be exciting. Yeah, I agree. I agree with everything. This track is particularly tricky, especially Turn 10, because the nature of the corner is that the car is getting lighter in the middle of the corner because there's this drop in the track and then however the car is positioned there it has a big influence on the exit and from where we are, so low in the car, we cannot see anything. I think the helmet cam is very representative of what we are seeing, and we are not seeing at all the white lines, so yeah, hopefully in the future in tracks like this we can have a bit more margin and that they understand that from the car it is just impossible to judge. Yeah, why not in some corners, like Turn 4 I think it definitely makes sense. I think Turn 4 is one of those corners where if you are really, really close to the gravel, you can, by one centimetre or two centimetres, you can be out, which then this definitely makes sense. I don't know how much it will change for the last sector, because with the high speed there, I think we need to find another solution. Well, I mean, we have two very different cars since last year, and even though on the Sunday they were starting to be signs at that point of the season that Red Bull was a little bit stronger, I think the difference was much smaller than what it has been this year. This year it’s to a much bigger extent. So I would be very surprised if we are doing the same race as last year. I hope so, and will do absolutely everything for this, but I will be very surprised if we've got as good of a pace as last year. But again, we don't know. I think that's where we need to confirm the upgrades that we've put on the car, whether we've gained the performance that we expected in the race, but there's definitely not the amount of lap time that was for the first part of the season in the race in that upgrade yet. It's too early to say. I think we need a few other races. And as I said earlier, I think the most important thing is to see those improvements in the race, where in some weekends we were fine on Medium tyres, let's say, and then we would struggle a lot on the Soft or on the Hard. Sometimes it was the other way around. I think we've been struggling in this first part of the season with consistency. So yeah, we need a bit more time before saying that our struggles are gone. Yeah, my personal preference would be to use the red and white kerb. I think that's what we did some years ago here, and this is working well, because at least we can feel where the limit of the track is, whenever you are on that red and white kerb, you can feel that you are on it. And this was a good reference. The white line is only visual. And as we said earlier, we cannot see it. So it's very easy to be five centimetres out of the white line. Whereas the kerb you can actually feel where you are. And it's a bit easier to judge. Yeah, I agree. I mean, if it's dry, especially, I think there's this new rule that after the first lap now we can activate DRS during the Sprint, if I'm not wrong, which obviously helps us a little bit as with DRS here you can stay within one second a little bit easier. But again, they've got a lot of pace, so it's going to be difficult anyway. Well, I pushed. This was my weakness for Q1 and Q2 and I knew this last lap I had to make the difference there, or at least go for it and see what happened. It worked well and I had two good last corners. But that was the weakness for the rest of Qualifying. So I'm happy I put everything together in the last lap of Q3.",Austria,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"It was good. I think we had a strong Quali as a team and definitely feels like we made some progress recently. Closer to Max also, maybe unexpected through that Qualifying, so overall we need to be quite happy. No, I think we have still a lot of weekend ahead of us. At least for today we put ourselves in a good position for Sunday to try and get a podium with both cars. And yeah, I think tomorrow will be a different day with different forecasts, different track conditions. So it could also be a very, very different picture. And we just need to stay focused. Obviously, we are in parc fermé, so it's not like we can improve the car a lot from today to tomorrow but we will look into the smallest details and into the smallest things to see if we can pick up a tenth or two from today to tomorrow. But I think the conditions tomorrow are going to be anyway very different. Yeah, feeling comfortable and feeling good out there today since FP1, which is a good sign, because it looks like we're getting a bit into a better rhythm as the season progresses. Yeah. Good Qualifying, good lap. Obviously, you can always find a bit more lap time when you look back at it but yeah, I think we can be proud as a team with the progress we're making. As Charles said, the team did a tremendous effort to bring an upgrade package to this race when it was not meant to be and probably it has helped us to be here today. So thank you for that. And now we will have to wait to the race to see how much real progress we've done, because we know that is where our struggles happen. A bit different, at least for me this weekend the high speed feels a bit more together. Barcelona, we were struggling a lot in the high-speed corners. And this weekend, the high-speed corners have been a better situation for us, better confidence, more consistent car. Again, that's part of the job that we wanted to do. But also the race pace is what we want to improve and we will need to see how we compare there to Max and to the Mercedes. Yeah, I think there's the issue of the visibility, that we don't see exactly where our tyres are. So it makes it very difficult to judge whether we are in or out. We have the issue also that we don't feel the white line. So if at least if we could feel a white line, if we are on top of it or not that could also help us to a judgement. It is a very particular track, for sure. But there are corners like Turn 1, Turn 4, Turn 6 that I got flagged also, where there is a natural limit, that is the kerb, there is a natural limit that is the gravel in those corners and still if you're going two centimetres wide, you are in the gravel, or you are in the kerb, you're losing lap time but still we get penalised for track limits, which for me also doesn't make more sense because you're not gaining an advantage by going over the track limits. So I think the rule of the track limits should be whether you're gaining an advantage or not also. For me, the main issue this Qualifying was how long the FIA was taking to decide. I mean, I went wide in, I think in Turn 1 in Q2, run two. I was P2 and because we didn't know and the FIA couldn't tell us whether I was going to get the flag thrown away, or the lap thrown away or not, I had to go and use another set of tyres, which obviously is quite a bit of an issue going into tomorrow. In the end, the lap was not deleted. So yeah, it's like there's so many track limits that even the FIA cannot keep up no? So, hopefully we can improve that, because it makes our life extremely difficult in the car and we need to keep finding a solution. Always. I think in the starts you always attack, no? I attacked Max in Barcelona. You always go on the attack mode because in F1 you either attack or you get attacked. So, you better be the one attacking, which I think is what we all do in lap one and it's in our nature as drivers and it’s true that it depends on who is in front of you. Like if it's your team-mate or if it's a car that is anyway going to be much quicker in the race then you, then you judge and you judge how much risk you are willing to take,. which is natural also in in every driver, but the mindset is always to try and move forward at the start. Yeah, I think we just need to work together and co-operate to find a solution. I think recently, the FIA has been a lot more open to collaborate and to cooperate and find a solution. But I think you're right saying why there's nothing being done. And I think it's simply because we haven't found a solution or we haven't put enough emphasis on finding a solution. And that's what we will have to do, because I think what we saw today with so many laps being deleted, so many drivers getting caught out, so many laps that even they couldn't keep up with deleting so many laps, that we need to we need to find a way to correct it. And we will sit down and hopefully for next year it's done. If not, then it means we're not making much progress. A short stint on the Sprint race is still a pretty long stint for the tyres that we might use. Because we are talking about 20-something laps, which is more or less the stint length that you do on a normal race, so deg, race pace still plays a massive part in that. It is true that last year we managed to put Max under pressure and beat him eventually. But it's a different year, a different car. They've become a lot stronger since then. Actually, I think Austria last year was their only, or the last weak race let's say, if we put it that way. Since then they've been amazing in the race. It will be extremely difficult to fight them. But anything can happen, like always in F1. You never know.",Austria,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"I think it was a good boost for the whole team, mainly looking at the race pace after a couple of difficult races where we were struggling with race pace. Finally in Canada, we seemed to have good race pace. Also, the fact that we were going forward in the race and not going backwards, makes a bit of a difference also for the perception of things. We actually finished fourth and fifth, that is a very similar result to the other race weekends that we’ve had – but the perception, the way that we were on the race, the pace was definitely different, which was good news. Yeah, a boost of motivation for the team. The same as any other race weekend! Just a lower deg circuit, which helps us for sure. It just shows that when you have a good race car, your tyre management is good. Also, the strategy is simpler, also it’s easier to make the strategy work. So yeah, that’s what we’re focussing on. To make sure that we focus on the race pace, make sure we have more often the car of Canada, than the car of Barcelona, and that will help us in the races, move forwards, make our strategy more flexible – and obviously have more fun in the race. No, unfortunately – or fortunately for Pirelli – we were testing the new no-blankets tyres, which obviously, you cannot learn much or apply much for our situation this year. Obviously, I still prefer to run, still prefer to do the test. And there's always things that you can try with your driving, but it's not like in this test you can actually really test anything or put something in place for the race weekend. Well, another step in the right direction. This is definitely the target. The team back in Maranello has done an incredible effort to bring them forward to this race. I cannot thank enough the people back in Maranello with the extra hours that everyone's put in to try and revert the situation and trying to put those extra minutes, extra hours of work to make these parts arrive. It's been a huge effort by everyone, and from here, I wanted to congratulate them and tell them that we're going to do our best to make them work well. And hopefully they're all worth it and we can be competitive this weekend. I’ll tell you when I test them, and I can feel them. Yeah, I think the shorter-term solution would be to at least do Q1 on a split: 10 cars, one from each team in a qualifying group. Then, I think by Q2, the traffic already improves quite a bit. Q3 is not a problem. So, it would be only short tracks, Q1s maybe. Divide the session by half and do eight minutes with one group, eight minutes with another group. Anyway, it shouldn't affect, because the performance of the cars are split. And yeah, that's the shorter-term solution. The single lap qualifying is maybe something to experiment with, as Fernando said. Also, maybe in Sprint weekends, to try, if it would work. I personally, was a big fan of it. Because I do like that feeling of suddenly having the whole track for you and having the pressure to perform only in one lap. I think that would be really good fun for us, I think for our sponsors, and for everyone. But maybe for the TV would be a bit boring for you. But I don't know, depends on the technology. You also have to animate that single lap. If you could put a ghost car of the fastest lap, I think with the technology that we have, nowadays, something like that could be achievable, with the mini-sectors, with a ghost car, with that kind of stuff that I think we should look into. Yeah, I think Fernando is getting a podium every weekend, so I am the one to blame! So yeah, hopefully sooner rather than later I can join him in one of those podiums, and celebrate together with champagne, which would be great for Spain. And for us – as we've always been good friends and we've always had a lot of respect for each other. I didn't intend to sound it like it was a genuine gain. I do think it's also track-related. Why? Because in Canada, there's basically… nearly zero deg, which helps us and then there's also no high-speed corners, that helps us. You put these two things combined and you have a race where the race pace, because we have less deg, and a car overall it was more competitive because there's none of the high-speed corners that we had in Barcelona, that we were struggling a lot. We are obviously trying to improve these weaknesses every race and, for sure, in Canada, we were trying to do steps. And here, with a package we're bringing, we're also trying to improve the performance. So, we might see an improvement and a tendency starting from Canada – but I do think still Canada suits us more than Austria. But let's see, it could also be different because here in Austria last year, we were also very competitive. So sometimes in F1 you have your circuits: weekends where the car just works better than others, and it's how it goes sometimes. There is a big gap between the Red Bull and us and to think that we're going to cut the gap with one upgrade, I think would be naïve and not realistic. Is the upgrade going to help our weaknesses and hopefully make us come closer? Yes. But at the same time, if Red Bull brings an upgrade to Austria, or anytime soon, it also means that your upgrade is less big. So, it's all relative in F1. I do hope that this upgrade is opening, a bit like we saw in Barcelona, a bit of a window of development and new opportunities and new ways to set up the car that help us move in the right direction. But I think it would be a bit optimistic, let's say, to think that suddenly we're going to be level par with Red Bull, with how competitive they are. But also Miami, no? I think after Quali we were. I agree. I think you guys can even tell, it's not like we need to be in a press conference to prove it or to show it. I think also if you look at when we are in Drivers’ Parade or around the paddock, you can just tell the relationship is like it's always been with me and Fernando. It's true that this year we are more… There's more competition, because we are fighting for similar positions, but that for me always stays on track and will always stay on track. And I know how to separate the track to the outside of the track. I think I've always been good at it. Fernando has always been good at it. We are both obviously mature enough to know that, and we're just going to try and enjoy the moment, because it's a good moment for Spain, a good moment for Formula 1 in Spain. The interest that we have is huge. And to spoil it with stupid stuff that might come out is I think not worth it. But honestly it’s not worth even giving my attention and commenting on it. Because it's giving importance and attention to people or someone that just doesn't know or just wants to do something bad, so I'll leave it there. Yeah. Also a year since I nearly got burned. But yeah, It's been a long year for sure. And I think from Austria last year until now, it's been tough. We had a bit of a dip in form towards the end of last year in race pace and then we carried that, let's say, difficult moment into this year and we are in exactly the turning point, or in the point of where we are trying to turn things around to make the car competitive again and to try and win again. It's not going to be easy because there's another team called Red Bull that have killed everyone, killed the opposition in a way, no? And we're not the only ones suffering it. There's teams also, like Mercedes, that have suffered their good job, and it's down to us now to revert it and to try our best to win again.",Austria,thursday,Ferrari
Pierre Gasly,"What does that mean? Well, that means that we obviously got more investment. But what it means, I think, is just the vision of the team. Of Alpine, of the Renault Group, of the Formula 1 team, to expand, to improve for the future in Formula 1, and try to use the expertise of these people that are coming on board. Three big firms: Otro, RedBird and Maximum Efforts joining on board. And they’ve got really good expertise and also other sports: NFL NHL, in football, in many other disciplines that will be trying to use as much as we can to improve our strength. I must say I'm personally a fan of him and his work. I think is definitely one of my favourite actors. And yeah, definitely super-excited to meet him at some point during the season. Stay away from Carlos! Nah, it's always tricky. Obviously in Canada it really impeded and had a pretty big impact on our whole race weekend. I think as a driver you always try to do your best. There are some tracks which are very easy to control the traffic, some others which are way more difficult. Montréal is one of these tracks which is tricky. Austria is going to be bad, and I think in this specific track, everyone, as a team from drivers to engineers to everyone that can help and support us inside the car to do a better job, will have to be on their top game. Because it’s a short track, four kilometres, everybody's trying to get gaps. But yeah, then you don't want to impede anyone. I was on the other side in Barcelona with Carlos, then Carlos was the role reversed in Canada, and sometimes it does penalise your entire weekend: it’s not only just Qualifying, but from the moment you start P17, at the back of the grid, it just changes the entire philosophy of your race. So yeah, it’s going to be tricky but hopefully everyone's going to manage it in the best way they can. I think, at the moment, we’re trying to get consistently in the top eight. We are, like, just on the edge. Sometimes we’re in the fight, closer to the top five, but I think it’s trying to get a clean weekend, which we didn’t have on my side for the last few races. So really, that’s going to be the main focus. Obviously have a Sprint race, while will allow us to potentially score more points. A different format, it’s going to be interesting. The package is working, we have pace in the car, we got speed, we’ve got a good race car on Sunday’s as well – but we just need to have a clean run.",Austria,thursday,Alpine
Fernando Alonso,"I don't know really. I think we have to see tomorrow in the free practice how the car feels, how competitive we can be this weekend. I think we had different performance in Barcelona and Canada, different feeling with the cars, so yeah, hopefully we are closer to a Canada kind of performance and try to deploy a little bit more of the package. Because in Canada, I think the weekend was very short, after the cancellation of FP1. So, it’s going to be a very short weekend here again – only FP1 – but hopefully we can test a few things on the car. I don’t know. I think we need to wait for different layouts, different circuits because, as I said, in Barcelona, just two weeks before Canada we were 55 seconds or one minute behind the leader. So, I think it was track-specific. It was a very good weekend for us, but I hope we can close that gap, yes. Well, that's definitely more interesting for us. I think Red Bull is in their own league at the moment, this year. So, for us, it is important to score points with both cars every weekend and try to keep up the fight with Mercedes and Ferrari, which obviously is still hard to believe for us, that we are in this battle. When we started the season in Bahrain we were definitely not expecting to be up there, and now we are just enjoying every weekend and it's good to be in this battle. Yeah, it is a topic every weekend and especially in short circuits. I don't know. There are a few options to improve this: one is single lap qualifying, like in the past. That would be ideal, in my opinion, because only one car on track and full TV coverage for that lap, for everyone’s sponsors and things like that. And that created a little bit of drama in case of weather changes in between qualifiers, you could see in pole position different cars, different names. So that was, I think, my preferred option. You can split the grid like junior formulas, they do in Monaco, and things like that. But it is a topic now. Yeah, the two Red Bulls out will be a way to achieve that sooner. Not really. I think when I tested in Abu Dhabi, I felt the car was good and it was competitive, but it is true that in Abu Dhabi the car was very similar to what I drove [with Alpine]. I remember on the grid, it was ninth, Sebastian, and me, I was P10. So we were in the same row of the grid. So, I think the performance of the Aston in the last race and the Alpine that I was driving, it was very similar. So when I jumped in that car, I felt OK. I felt also similar to what I drove the whole season. But I think they made a lot of progress during the year. So that's why [when] we think of Aston last year, we may think of the struggles at the beginning and mid-season, but I think at the end of the year they had a reasonable car. So the step over winter was just a normal progress that they followed all throughout the year. I think we've been in the same room many times. You were not here? Ah, not this year? No, no, for sure. I mean, we were, maybe not this year, but many times and as Carlos said before, we know each other for a very, very long time and we are good friends, inside the circuit and outside as well. And as you said, you know, there are many stupid things and this year because I have a competitive car and we are fighting close together on track, as you said, in Spain, we are like this. We have to accept, us, and we have to unfortunately know that the level of journalism in Spain is low. Not for you. But generally. So that's the way it is. That's why, you know, we are not often in Spain, unfortunately. And we try to avoid our country, unfortunately, for many things. No, of course. Of course, of course, Mercedes is going to be very, very competitive. They are a very strong team. Very strong drivers. And they will be in the fight every weekend, for podiums, for race wins. They said, even, that they will bring some significant upgrades to the car and hopefully make some fight with Red Bull as well in the future. So I think Mercedes proves many times that they will be a contender for everything, every weekend. So obviously our target and our goal is to catch Red Bull eventually, one day, but in the process of doing that we know that Ferrari and Mercedes, they will be very strong.",Austria,thursday,Aston Martin
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I do. Obviously, it kept me busy. I went there for a sponsor of mine, which is Dior. I think Pierre was there as well, the day before that, so yeah, had an enjoyable time over there, and seeing a few friends as well, and yeah, now back obviously to racing and hopefully can climb to where we left-off three weeks ago – because Canada for me was kind of one to forget, and try to learn from that. That’s in the plan of maybe when I’m retiring – or Fernando’s age maybe! Right now the main focus is obviously racing – but besides that I obviously have a high interest. My family, my mother, used to be one of the designers back in the day, so maybe I get that from her. So yeah, I always had a high interest, but obviously Formula 1 is a bigger platform for me to be a bit more myself, and that spills out into the fashions. So yeah, I’m happy to obviously design some cool stuff. To wear your own clothes, I think that’s definitely the coolest thing that can happen. I think it’s definitely a further step up. Like we said in Monaco. We have introduced this new package and it hasn’t been upgraded since then but it’s clearly worked much better in higher-speed tracks, even though in Montréal on a medium-low speed track it seems to be working in the right direction. And now hopefully that does bring us forward into a more competitive fight day, even though I think it's very close between us, Haas and the Williams, fighting behind for the Constructors' Championship – but we are closing the gap. And it's nice to see that both cars are able to fight at least in the point positions where, let's say, after Bahrain we seemed to be missing a little bit of pace. No, we were able just to find a bit, back to normal, fighting for the last two positions in the Top 10. So, it's a good step forward and we're looking forward to convert that into hopefully a double-points finish very soon together on track. Yeah, I mean, they pretty much had everything with the ideas. But these days, I think the drivers rely a lot on mirrors and engineers. Obviously with the speed travelling around the Red Bull Ring, it’s going to be very difficult for us, especially when there’s a massive train coming into the second-last corner. But coming into the future, I think these ideas could be a way forward. Also, there could be idea on the dash, maybe you get to see when is the next car, how many seconds close by you, in the future development on the dash, system-wise but that's pretty much everything I can think of.",Austria,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, it's been a good one to me in the past. Obviously, it's not been the easiest, last couple of races. So, you know, the plan is to get back on track. Seems like the upgrade’s working well. So, hopefully we can get things moving in the right direction, and rebound on a track that's been good to me in the past. Yeah, I think from what I've spoken to Alex about it, it seems like the characteristics of the car are relatively similar, which is good for me because it's not like driving a whole new car – but at the same time, just more compliance. It's quicker, more downforce, so it's just better all around. Yeah, I don't think it should be too bad. I think it's one that will be on the better side for us. It’s still going to be a challenge, for sure. Hopefully we can use everything. It’s a Sprint weekend; weather conditions look a little bit tricky as well, so we’ll do our best to keep ourselves in the fight. Yeah, it was. But honestly, I enjoy it. I don't mind having the one session straight into Qualifying. You know, I was even enjoying the Sprint Qualifying the next day. Obviously, it didn't end well. But for the most part, it's good: it gives us more, in my opinion, opportunity under pressure, which is nice. And also, to have two races is good for me to keep learning. Well, racing cultures I'm not really sure, because I raced my whole life in Europe. I think it is important though. I think if you don't make the move, you're just sort of a step behind. You know, there's no way you can travel back and forth. It's just too difficult. But yeah, I think it is a big sacrifice. But I think if you want to reach Formula 1 that's the way you have to do it. And to be honest, I look at the karting list nowadays, and I see a lot of American kids in it. So, it's good to see and I'm actually familiar with a few of the names from sons of previous drivers. So yeah, hopefully we can see more Americans coming through and into junior formulas soon. A step behind in the sense of, as I said, you can't travel back and forth to Europe for every race. And, you know, if you really want to progress on the European ladder I think that comes to needing to commit to moving to Europe and, you know, putting in maximum effort to reach Formula 1. If not, you're always a bit late.",Austria,thursday,Williams
George Russell,"Yeah, definitely. I think going from… That’s a nice replay you’ve got there, I appreciate that! Yeah, I think going from Barcelona, which was probably a circuit that suited us down to a tee, then to Canada, a totally opposite circuit, to see that we still had pretty good pace, fighting with the Aston’s and Max didn't seem too far ahead, either, things are definitely going in the right direction. So this will be another interesting weekend. Sprint race, never straightforward, but I think, as a team, we're making really good progress. Yeah, I'd say so. I think it will suit us better than Montréal. I think Silverstone will be slightly a step in the right direction again, more similar to Barcelona. But as I said, you know, we're developing really, really well, at the moment. The team back at Brackley and the team here, are doing an exceptional job to improve what we've got, and try and close that gap. I mean, it feels to a degree, that they're coming a little bit closer to us. I think when you look at the average compared to the whole field, for whatever reason, it seems like Red Bull may have taken a small step back. But you know, when they’re three steps ahead, they're now two steps ahead. So, they've still got a lot of margin. I was told recently, about half an hour ago, that they’ve won the last 17 out of 18 races, so they are cruising at the moment. They're doing a really good job. But hopefully, it's not too long until we can turn the tide. I mean, it's got a combination of corners, being on the hill it's always quite exposed to the wind, so you get these moments where it catches you out. But, you know, it's the same for everybody. Last year wasn't our finest Qualifying session. But we had a good race. And this year's going to be a different dynamic again, with the weather that may be here throughout the weekend, with only the one practice session. I’m excited to get going. I don’t know, to be honest. I think we’re all so focused on our job that obviously Max is the one doing the solid job week-in, week-out. He’s the number one at the moment. Number two and number three? No one else cares about. We’re all after number one, so yeah, that’s Max’s spot at the moment. I haven’t but… This sport’s incredibly difficult to judge and it’s… I think that’s the challenge of Formula 1. We’ve said it before. As drivers, we want to be in a position where we can go head to toe (sic) week-in, week-out with everyone on a level playing field. In an ideal world, all of the cars are the same and then we truly know. Max spent three years at Red Bull winning a couple of races here and there and now he’s winning 20 a year or whatever. It’s not because he’s suddenly got a second a lap faster over three years of driving; he’s just doing the job when the car’s giving him the opportunity. Many drivers are doing a good job. Fernando’s doing a good job, Lewis is doing a good job, Lando, Oscar’s doing a good job. Hulk, P2 last week, he’s doing a good job. Who knows? I hope that answers your question. Yeah, same as Nico, I think Qualifying’s pretty good as it is. Traffic is sometimes bad at certain tracks. I think the only suggestion we had in the past was to have like your GPS delta on the dash, so you're not relying on your engineers because when you're going slow the cars come at you so quick and we're always relying on our engineers to tell us, so put it in our hands to manage and not somebody else's. Yeah, I think we've made a lot of changes to the car since then. It'll probably be a good baseline to look back compared to last year as obviously the circuits we've been at recently, bar Barcelona, have been pretty unique circuits. Yeah, I'd like to think we'd be in a slightly better place. We've definitely made improvements with how the car handles through the corner, making improvements with the overall downforce which we know we've still got gains to be made. But I see no reason why we can't have a strong race on Sunday. We know that qualifying is not our strength but if we get things right, there's no reason we can't fight for a podium. Yeah, I think we'll all welcome that. I think the perception of speed with sound sort of goes together. So it's like in the UK, there used to be a car that was a Citroën Saxo and people used to put this massive exhaust on it and you'd hear it coming from miles away and you think it'd be a Ferrari, and it turned out to be this Saxo. But I think there's something to be said that you want that noise, that buzz around the track. Yeah, I welcome it, definitely. I think the biggest thing is that there's always a lot of question marks, regardless of whether it comes to race scenarios, penalties, no penalties, race start, people cutting the corners. My example, even, in Barcelona where I took the escape route, should that have been penalised or not? And I think it's important, maybe twice or three times a year that we come together with the guys making the decisions so they hear our views and we also hear theirs. You obviously want this consistency and that's what we're trying to achieve. No, I think the emotions that… I spoke with obviously all of the engineers and mechanics and apologised for the off, but it was simple as that: move on, onto the next race. And yeah, definitely better at dealing with these emotions. I think, as a driver, you never want to make mistakes, you never want to fail or lose, but I think these moments make you stronger as a driver, as a human being, and you need those failures to progress. It's history for me now, not even thinking about it, onto this weekend. Won't be my last crash, for sure, it's part and parcel of pushing the boundaries. Obviously, you want to limit it, but it’s just one of those things. I think it's pure coincidence. I think it's like he says, very fine margins. I think out of all the teams on the grid we’re statistically the closest of everybody in terms of team-mates. Lewis is obviously a very strong driver. Yeah, it's funny. I think at the start of last year, I think Lewis was on a higher level than I was, yet I was well ahead of him in the championship. And now this year, I think we're at a very close level, and the championships… I'm 40-odd points behind him. Ultimately, that's the only thing that matters. We're going into this weekend and we’ll see what we can do but certainly the last couple of races haven't been the best run of form for me. But as I said, history now and let's see what the upcoming races bring.",Austria,thursday,Mercedes
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah, obviously, what's the Saturday worth if the Sunday goes the way it did? I mean, we were quite unfortunate with the timing of the Safety Car. That was pretty costly for me personally. But we definitely… It's a trend now that we've been struggling on Sundays with pace, you know, with tyre management, with degradation. It's something we are aware of, we are working on it, trying to get on top of the situation more, but obviously a weekend with a big contrast. Great Saturday and then a more tricky, difficult Sunday. Well, obviously in Quali you get new tyres all the time and they don't get very old, and over 60-90 seconds the tyre can sustain those forces and the grip quite well, but if you're talking a stint of 20, 30, 40 laps, it’s obviously a very different cup of tea and a very different challenge for the tyre. So it just tells us something about our car, the characteristic we have, I think doesn't suit that so much in race conditions when we're in traffic, when we're surrounded by other cars, we just struggle, we struggle too much. And we're trying to address that. It's difficult to predict. It's a Sprint weekend on top of that, so very busy, very hectic. Hopefully, there'll be some weather that can play into our hands. But yeah, we need to see in a few weeks and months how we can address it and how much progress we can make. But it's not going to be an easy ride from here. OK, short and not painful: Max, Fernando, Pierre. I feel like, as Max said, some tracks are more difficult than others but I also feel that some teams and drivers are better than others, and pay more attention and some less. And some create situations more than others and I personally like how our Qualifying is. I think it's quite good to watch, it's quite good fun from inside the car so I'm pretty happy. Yes, same. I think from back in the day when I came to always approaching the track before my time in F1, you could hear the cars miles and miles away and that was part of the excitement, you get goosebumps. It's an emotion and I think we've had definitely less of that. It's much better now than I think initially, 2014 and ’15 were not so great but I think definitely positive news.",Austria,thursday,Haas
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, we can. Quite painful. I thought the suspension would do a better job but it didn’t really, so it was actually jumping around quite a lot. That was it? No, I didn’t. Well, not in the race, but in qualifying I did, but I had a bit of weight penalty. It’s like 40 kilos I think. It was good. We had a good day and we definitely laughed a lot and that, for me, was the most important thing as well. I think we’ve had already a few Grands Prix without Dietrich, of course, by our side and you just have to face it, you have to deal with it and we race also to make him proud and just carry on that legacy. So coming here, home Grand Prix, we always enjoy coming here anyway and we want to win, definitely. I don’t know, honestly. In a Sprint weekend so many things can go well or can go wrong. It’s always very hectic so I guess we’ll just find out honestly. I don’t know. We can speculate about it now but we’ll find out on Sunday. Don’t get too drunk. Just watch the race, enjoy. It will good to see them. It’s always nice to see the orange colour next to the track. I think also, about this track, on any grandstand that you sit in, you can actually see a lot of the track and that makes it very unique, I think. I don’t know to be honest. Like George said, it’s impossible to actually fully know because you can only compare to your team-mate, and the other cars you don’t know how the performance actually is so I don’t know. There are a lot of good drivers on this grid who all deserve to be in that top three. so I don’t know. Absolutely! Well, I think we all know that this is motor sport in general, right? You need to perform to the best you can. It's not forever anyway but like Nyck said, you can't force things as well. So it's about how you work together with your team, gain more experience as well and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what people above you say, it’s about how then you learn from your weekends, learn from your mistakes like we all do, and yeah, just get on top of the car a little bit more, feel a bit more comfortable and definitely don't force it. Just talk to engineers: what can we do better, what can be worked on? And then at one point, when these things click a little bit more, you can get these results and then if you have one good result maybe it leads to another one and then you feel a bit more comfortable anyway. So yeah, it's a lot of things that have to come together at the end of the day. Don't get too stressed about it, but just work hard together with all your people involved who can actually make a difference and influence your performance. But I don't even need to tell Nyck, he knows that, he has a lot of experience. We'll see again this weekend to be honest and this is for everyone, of course, it's not only Nyck, everyone, every single weekend you have to work together with your engineers because again, we, like this year we have a very quick car but if I would just sit back and relax and think that everything will come to me then the results at one point will stop coming and you cannot let that happen. It's quite cool but again there's also track evolution, so not sure it's the best idea. But again, yeah, there is always traffic, but this has been for Monza… You just have to try and manage it. I know some tracks, of course, are a bit better than others but yeah, it's a tricky one. Yeah, I wonder, of course how much can be done but for sure, back in the day, if you would walk into the paddock and there was a free practice session going on it was quite… From a far distance you were like, wow, this is incredible even though the speeds were, on a straight, slower than what we're doing now. So yeah, the sound definitely has a big, big influence on that. I would definitely welcome it. Life is unfair as well. It's not only in Formula 1. Like I said, a lot of things are unfair, so we just have to deal with it.",Austria,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it’s always nice to come back to somewhere more familiar. It’s not guaranteed to bring results like we saw in Barcelona but no, it will be nice to have a few laps and especially with one practice session tomorrow, it’s nice to have a bit of prior knowledge. Yeah, we’re excited. We’ve got upgrades on Lando’s car this weekend. The plan was both of us to have (it) in Silverstone but the team have done a very good job of getting one set forward for this weekend. So yeah, looking forward to seeing how that performs and of course we’ve got a stable package on my side of things, we know exactly what it’s capable of, so still try to get into the points and do what we can. No, they were taking it pretty easy. Either that or it is much slower than it looks! But no, they were really good guys, nice to do something different. I played quite a lot of cricket growing up, so very cool to see it up close, to go to Lords as well, it’s a pretty cool ground. Almost as good as the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground)! No, really enjoyed it. The game is looking pretty close at the moment so yeah, hopefully we can add another one to the tally. Max, Fernando as well I think and I would agree with Yuki as well. I think he’s done a good job this season.",Austria,thursday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, of course I'm very happy right now. It was not a very straightforward race because the tyres were not really getting in their window. It was very cold today compared to Friday and we were sliding around quite a bit. But yeah, we made it work and yeah to win again, today to win the 100th Grand Prix for the team, that's incredible. It’s amazing. I mean, I never expected to be on these kinds of numbers myself as well, you know. So, yeah, we keep enjoying, we keep working hard. But today has been a great day again. Firstly, I expected more or less what we had today, but it was, like I said, really difficult to just keep the grip, the temperature into the tyres, because the grip was disappearing very quickly. That's why maybe the gap was not that big. But yeah, we had a few Safety Cars here and there. But yeah, overall, we won, that's the most important. Yeah, I mean, they're so passionate about the sport. Also, yesterday with the rain, they were just hanging in there, so that was great to see. And yeah, we love coming here. And hopefully we can do this for a long time. Well, to be honest, I didn't really know what to expect because of the track in general. So it had nothing to do with competitors or whatever. But just for myself as well. Because also we changed the car quite a bit. We changed the car around quite a bit compared to Friday, so I didn't really know how it would feel today. But yeah, luckily, it went in the right direction. But I think it was quite tough today to keep the tyres in the right window, they were always running quite cold. So we had to push actually quite hard on the tyre. And then with low grip, low rubber, it was not the easiest or most straightforward. But yeah, everything went well, just the hard tyre. Probably that stint was a bit of a limitation, because of the harder compound, even harder to keep the tyre temps. And I think we know that our car normally is very good when there’s high deg compared to other cars. And today probably you would have needed a car which is a bit harder on the tyre, to keep the temperatures in, you know. So it's probably not been our best race today. But still, to win by nine seconds, I think shows that we have a great car. Well, from our side, like I said, I don't think it was our best day, because of the tyre temps and stuff. So that doesn't help. But I also know that with their updates, they naturally of course improved. So, for sure, they got closer to us. Yeah, I mean, I hate to compare different generations. From my side, the only thing I can say is that when I was a little kid driving in go-karting, I was dreaming about being a Formula 1 driver and I would have never imagined to win 41 Grands Prix. So of course, to tie with Ayrton is something incredible. And of course, I'm proud of that, but of course, I hope it's not stopping here. You know, I hope that we can keep on winning more races. Yeah, I mean, I've won 41 of them! But, yeah, we'll talk about maybe a new contract because of that! No, honestly, it's a great achievement for the team. We knew that this was the first opportunity, of course, to do so. And I'm happy that's done. We've won 100. But again, I hope we win more than 100. So the new target is 200. 10 years ago, I was not on the grid, so… Nah, I remember, back in the day, I was watching these two already in Formula 1 racing each other, right. So, of course, very happy now that I’m in Formula 1 as well and racing them is probably the best thing out there. When we can share a podium together – I think we’ve done it now a few times? – I think it’s great. I think of course they want to swap positions, of course. I'm happy in the middle at the moment. Fernando’s already been asking me this! It’s tough, because normally it’s all about tyre management, right? But today was definitely more about pushing. But sometimes it was just going up and down a lot in lap-time. So then sometimes you couldn't actually push to the limit, because you didn't know what you were going to get. So, for me, on the Hard tyre, it was quite a bit of a struggle, and then on the Medium, I wanted to open-up that gap a little bit more. So then, of course, at one point, you’re seeing, like 10-15 laps to go and you have a good gap, you don’t want to take too many risks. It’s probably not flat-out pushing, but you cannot relax too much because then you lose the temperature in your tyres. So… yeah… somewhere in the middle of that. I don't know what the percentage is, but… Not worried but you are alert because you keep checking: is he catching or not? What do I need to do, because at the beginning of the race when he pass Lewis, OK, let’s see what his pace is and then initially it was quick and then I could manage my pace around it.  And then on the hard tyres, I think the beginning was good, like I was creating a bit of a gap but then I started to struggle with my tyres a little bit so it’s constantly just talking to your engineers, seeing of course on the pit board what’s happening. You can’t relax too much, and especially today with the tyres being so cold, you have to be on it all the time, especially also here a street circuit. A tiny mistake is big lap time lost or you’re in the wall. Yeah, I don't even know where to start to be honest. We've lived through so many things. After my Dad's own career he invested all his time in mine. It's hard to explain how much he has dedicated to me, because I probably still don't even understand how much he did. He was preparing everything, go-karts, engines and then driving all the way to Italy with me,  in between school, then back. So many stories we can share. Sometimes we still talk about it, of course, when we are together. Yeah, it's crazy. I probably only will fully realise how much he has done to me once I get kids, then you start to understand this kind of relationship. But yeah, without him I would not sit here today. He has taught me so much and prepared me so much from a very young age where sometimes I thought why does it need to be so serious straightaway, where you maybe want to play around a bit more and have fun. But he was working towards this goal. He had this goal set for me to be first of all better than him and then tried to get to Formula 1. And then I got to Formula 1 and then slowly of course…  we still call every day. Before the race I was still talking to him about what we're going to do with the strategy and stuff like that. He likes to know even when he's not here and yeah, just like to have that kind of relationship with your Dad.  After go-karting of course, when you go into cars, it's a bit less personal what was happening here. So sometimes you miss these kinds of go-karting times when you're travelling together in a van all the way there. But yeah, to share these moments together I think is very special. And today was of course also Father's Day, so I don't need to buy him a present, I did this so I think he's happy. It's, a big difference to what ’16, ’17?",Canada,post-race,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Probably yes. I think we were hoping to challenge a little more the Red Bull. But we lost a place at the start with Lewis and then yeah, it was a battle with the Mercedes and Lewis was pushing all the race, so I didn't have one lap where I could relax a little bit. So it was an amazing battle. I mean, at the beginning, I had a little bit more pace. At the end I think Lewis had a bit more pace. Yeah, it was tough. It was a very demanding race, you know, all 70 laps of qualifying today. I don't really know. They didn't tell me so maybe it was not to make me worry too much. But I don't know. I felt the car was OK. But I was just following the instructions. So yeah, hopefully that means that we have a little bit more pace. So next one, putting more pressure on Max. Very, very. I think it has been a tough race from the beginning, you know, when we lost a place at the start I thought that maybe that was already gone, P2, and I would have to concentrate on the guys behind, George and the Ferraris maybe. But then, yeah, we were able to overtake Lewis and we had a little bit more pace in that part of the race. And I was quite OK, until the last 20 or 25 laps, that Lewis was coming very fast and I had to push again to the limit. So yeah, all in all, it was 70 laps of qualifying. So there was no time to rest. And I loved it. I didn't know you know. With all these procedures, we go to the podium, then to the TV pen and now here and I still don't know anything that happened to the lift and coast that I had to do, or the start. So maybe we need to reduce the media time and give us a little bit of time with the engineers and maybe we come here with more info. Slow! My reactions are still very good! No, I don't think… I need to check, I don't know if the guys starting on that side of the grid, they started good or not. Because I only sure Max and Lewis, obviously, but George didn’t overtake me, so maybe it was just the wrong side of the grid. Yeah, I cannot answer now. We didn't have another Medium. So that is something that you need to decide before Qualifying, the tyre allocation for Qualifying and the race, sometimes you decide to go for one Medium, one Hard because you think it’s enough; sometimes two Hard, sometimes two Mediums. And obviously with the very limited practice that we did on Friday, it was just a guess. I’m happy with the decision: for us the Hard was not a bad tyre at all and we were able to extend the stints, and in our car, it was a good tyre. Yes. I mean, it's good, it's great. I really enjoy these battles and these podiums. It happened in Australia,, I think last time and now here, and there is a lot of respect, a lot of talent when you fight against Max, Lewis. You know that you cannot make a mistake because they will take advantage of that, and they will not make a mistake. So, if you want to beat them, you need to be tenth-after-tenth, fastest to close that gap. It’s not anything that will benefit. It’s a very intense battle, very fair, very respectful, even in the overtaking possibility that we had on the DRS, for me when I passed Lewis, you know that you can trust what he’s doing: he will defend hard but within the limits. I guess same at the start, when you start in the first two rows with these guys, you know that there’s a sense of awareness and respect that it’s not sometimes in other parts. Yeah, Austria, yeah, let’s see. I think the sprint weekend will not be ideal for us. We still have more time maybe of free practice with our new upgraded car. We still need to understand and optimise the package a little bit and in Austria, obviously with the sprint, we will have only FP1 to do that. But yeah, it is what it is. The circuit will be good and maybe better for the package as well, this one with a strange layout, let’s say. Maybe good for Ferrari, historically here as well with a long straight and short corners so maybe Austria we have a little bit more pace. It's not the day in Spain, in Spain it’s in March, I think. But anyway, congratulations to my father… Yeah, my father is different, he has no talent at all to drive. And so yeah, he teach me and educate me in different ways and more for different things in life. He didn't have the vision of being a professional driver when I was a kid. Yes, I was racing in go-karts and in different things but he was just thinking that that will end soon. And, you know, my life will be completely opposite to professional sport. So he was always very… with the feet on the ground, let's say, and teaching me all the things and other values because it was difficult to believe that I was able to reach Formula 1 one day and that's the beauty of our story.",Canada,post-race,Aston Martin
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, honestly it's been a great weekend for us. I think we are slowly chipping away. I think the Astons took a little bit of a step ahead this weekend when they added the upgrades but we're working on bringing some more moving forwards. But to just have this consistency and to be up on the podium here in Montréal, which is such an incredible city and we've got such a great crowd here every single year without fail. So big thank you to everyone here. Yeah, I mean, well, firstly, quite an honour to be up there with two world champions. I was really excited to be third and just trying to be in that mix. But unfortunately, we didn't have the pace today. I think where we struggle… I mean, we knew that this weekend, this wouldn't be our strongest circuit, as we struggle in the lower-speed corners particularly. And that's really where I was losing to Fernando and to Max, just on traction out of Turn 2, out of pretty much every corner. We've got a lot of work to do just to add rear downforce to the car and a little bit more efficiency, but we're chipping away as I said, and I do believe we will get there at some stage. Max was a little bit gone, but I think our pace is a little bit closer today, so we are going in the right direction. It’s been a great weekend. Very difficult with the conditions but loving being in the car now with the car in a better window and a bit more on the right track. And for us to be up there, having battles with Fernando in the Aston, and being just on the second row, it’s been great. And to be on the podium, two races in a row is really, really fantastic for us. We were also running fourth in Monaco, so we're definitely getting closer. And it's going to be a battle of development, I guess, over the rest of the season. I reckon Max’s team are already working on next year’s car, so we need to take our eye a little bit off the ball and focus on next year also but yeah, happy to be up there. Low speed, rear end. His rear end… I mean, I got to experience being behind Max and his rear is very strong. His rear end doesn’t move and he pulls ten car lengths probably on me just coming out of the corners. I think Fernando’s very, very strong on the brakes, and particularly very quick through Turn 10 and Turn 2. Those places, he was taking huge chunks out of me. Not much more to add, but I agree with Fernando, it's a privilege to be up here fighting these two who've done incredible in their careers. And this is quite an iconic top three. I don't know if there's been a top three like this ever before. I don't believe there has. But yeah, so hopefully there'll be more and hopefully, as Fernando said, there's a lot of respect between us as we were able to race so closely and trust in one another. I'm really hoping at some stage we have more of a level playing field in our cars, and then we'll have a much more exciting race, I think in the future. Beyond. It’s not a frustration anymore, if it ever was. It's… you know how it is, and you know what you're faced with, and there's nothing I can do about their amazing performance. It's likely that they will win every race, moving forwards, this year, unless the Astons and us put a lot more performance on the cars, or their car doesn’t finish. It's not easy with the regulations to find the amount of performance that they have, advantage-wise. They've got to be 30 points upon us in certain points through the lap and we've got some work to do. But it's not that it's frustrating, I just, as I said, look forward to… I'm happy to firstly be back in the mix and I'm just hoping at some stage we can have it all a little bit more level so we can get back to some of the good races we had back in 2021. And to have all three of us in a super-tight battle would be sick. I don’t know what the question was, I didn’t understand it. I didn’t understand if I’m honest. I don’t get what the point is. He’s a multi-World Champion. so he knows what he’s doing. Ah… I don’t get it. Yeah, same as these guys. Happy Father's Day to my Dad, I already posted about it this morning. He sacrificed everything for me to be here today so I continue to try and make him proud. I know how hard it was for him with everything that he faced because I was right there with him. But the ultimate dream is always to be like your father. I want to be like my father. In truth, it doesn't feel a huge difference to the beginning of the year. There are some elements of the car which do feel different and obviously with the upgrade but it's just simply just have a little bit more downforce on the car. But the characteristics of the car are very, very similar to what we had earlier on in the year and so we need to… for the future, for the next year's car, you need to take a lot of these different things off and change them for sure. It's definitely not the car that… characteristic-wise the car that's going to be able to beat the Red Bull just yet. And so we've got to work on that. For example, it was very bumpy, this track, and I think everyone was struggling but our car was very stiff. But I think we were all struggling with the stiffness of our cars. But today was bumpy. That's the one that thing that… I would say that's something I dislike most about this generation of cars, right? Back in the day was smooth down the straight. I mean, you're generation…",Canada,post-race,Mercedes
Nico Hülkenberg,"I did. It was a it was a wild Quali, it was crazy. You know, changing conditions are tricky, especially around here with, with the walls so close on the exits, and the speeds high. Obviously it was wet, dry and back to wet, you know, you have to readjust all the time. But it was fun. It was good. Obviously, this comes a bit unexpected, but obviously very happy and proud. The team did a solid job. It was very smooth. So super happy. Yeah, in this weather it's just a lot of communications, you know, a lot of radio calls going back and forth. Obviously, you look at what the others do, and you think for yourself, but I think we pitted pretty well today. No major mistakes. And I guess that's also why we stand here now. Yeah, we'll have to see. Obviously, first row is nice. It's very sweet. Let's see how long we can keep that and let's see what the conditions are tomorrow. All the signs are that it will be very different. A dry race. So a very different cup of tea. You know, I just want to go out there race as hard as we can, squeeze it, and hopefully we'll get a nice result. It's definitely nice to have a strong qualifying result. Challenging conditions, like Max explained, but I feel like we stayed on top of the situation, had good communication throughout and clean laps. And yeah, hence, we rewarded ourselves with this nice, sweet Quali result. He said well done, good job. Obviously, we're pretty pleased. We have… realistically, obviously, we've qualified out of position for a normal, dry running, or dry pace. Yesterday was tricky. Also, I didn't really get much dry running. Whatever happens tomorrow we'll just take the moment now, enjoy it and fight as hard and do what we can tomorrow. Yeah, it's always tough, knowing what to expect. I mean, this is still half a street circuit with a lot of walls on the exit. There's a few tricky corners on parts of the circuit and you're pushing. So, when you push, exploit the limit, you never really know what can happen, but I think we've managed the tyres well, we've managed to switch them on as well, which often is a struggle in these conditions. But it'll work for us. It worked out and happy days. I'm going for fame into Turn One! But let's see what happens after that. No, I don't feel I've lost out. Certainly the first few weekends, especially, in a race, a race is very dynamic, things change all the time and you have to keep adjusting, that took a couple of races to fully get comfortable again and to get on top of things and on top of that just learn a new car but that's kind of natural. Yeah, I never really felt those three years that they've taken something away from me. I think if you know how to drive, if you know the laws of racing and then the physics of driving they don't really change even though cars or tyres change. It's still the same subject thing, it’s more you know optimising everything else around it. Yeah, exactly. Good point from you. I think, like I said earlier, I think today we can take it, enjoy it. Take that moment with us. Obviously, we have to prepare for the race. We've got to be realistic. Recently our race pace hasn't been the strongest point from us; actually, it was more always qualifying than race. On top of that yesterday was a difficult day with… anyway it was compromised and short running for everyone but even more so for myself. So, yeah, a lot of challenges to overcome that tomorrow and a big job anyways, but at least we start from a good position. For sure, there's going to be a lot of heat from the back, there's a lot of faster cars that will come through, but our focus is just to maximise tomorrow's race and the potential. Hopefully somewhere between P1 and P10.",Canada,post-qualifying,Haas
Max Verstappen,"Yesterday maybe wasn't fantastic. So we made a few changes to the car. Of course, today, you know, it was completely wet, so it's a bit different. But I do think that the car improved in general to drive. And yeah, I mean, in the wet, you have to just stay on top of all the conditions. And it was super slippery out there in some places. But yeah, we just made all the right calls at the right time on the track, you know, to do the lap times. And of course, we're happy to be on pole here. I like driving in the wet. I mean, I come from Holland, you know, so we are used to driving in the wet! It's just fine-tuning. It's not really a problem, but you always want to improve in little areas. Let's see. I mean, maybe it's dry tomorrow. And then it can be again a bit different. But normally we have a good race car. Yeah, I think Q1 was quite straightforward with Inters. The track was quite dry in some places. So there are not many things that you could catch you out, because the tyres were getting up to temperature quite quickly. So that was good. But after that, of course, then you had to make the call in Q2, with when to switch to the slick tyres. I opted to initially go out on the Inter, just to get a lap in, because they work a bit better, of course, than cold slick tyres on a bit of a damp track. But then it was quite clear that I needed to go to the slicks. So we did a pit stop and those slick tyres, the first lap, the first two laps – so, out lap and first timed – it’s quite tricky knowing the grip levels and knowing how hard to push, so you’re a little bit under it. Luckily, then we got a decent lap in at the end, which was enough to go through to Q3. And then after that, it started to slowly increase, the rain. And at one point it was not possible anymore to drive with the slicks. But overall, I think we just had good communication with the team, you know, throughout Q1, Q2, which I think is the most important, and we were clear with what we wanted to do. And then in Q3, of course, it kept on raining, so it was very important to be out there quickly and get the laps in. Of course, I had to wait a long time at the end of the pit lane. You know, the tyres are cold, but it does give me like clean air and good vision, which I guess also helped to put the lap in. Well, you know, from our radar, it said that it was continuing to rain throughout the Q3. So, we just really want it to be up front and just wait. Well, I think it's better already today. Okay, it was in the wet, but the general behaviour of the car was improved. And tomorrow yeah, we'll find out. I mean, the long run still looked alright; we're quite happy with that. But they're always, of course, things that you want to look at and improve and that's what we did. Maybe the one lap pace wasn't fantastic. But that's not what we are, of course, worried about tomorrow in the race. Difficult to know. I mean Fernando had a very good long run. The Ferraris were quite strong in the dry, including also Mercedes. So it's a bit difficult to say at the moment. Eyes closed! I mean, we always try to have a good start but it's important to just stay calm. It's a very long race so a lot of things that can happen. Yeah, I don't know. I think in general it helps if you are confident in the wet but that only - I guess - happens when… it's a lot of feeling as well, knowing how to drive it, what lines to take, it’s difficult to fully explain why that happens but it's something you have been learning since a little kid. I remember back in the go-karting days my Dad was literally standing on the track telling me where to drive in the wet because I think he, back in the day, was also quite decent in the wet. Just learning and then at one point understanding yourself what is going on and what you have to do, how to drive fast in the wet.",Canada,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, our garage is in this part of the paddock so we have a little bit of an advantage! But yeah, it was a very tricky Qualifying in terms of choosing the right tyre at the right time. And yeah, P3, you know, we take it, I think it's a good starting position. It is amazing every time we come here. It's not only the race track, it's also the city. You know, I love Montréal, how they embrace the GP and yeah, yesterday in FP1, unfortunately, they waited for us to go out. And today, I hope they enjoy and tomorrow they will. Yeah, let's see. I think tomorrow we have a chance to put some pressure. I think they had very easy wins until now and hopefully tomorrow they have to push a little bit more. Two seconds behind them. Not 20 seconds behind them. Yeah, well we've been unlucky generally with the red flags today and in Q1 also, I think it was one second to see the line and then the red flag came just in that moment. And in Q3, yeah, it was I think four seconds before crossing the line to be in the first row. But, I mean, we take it. I'm extremely happy because it was very complex qualifying to execute and as they said, you need constant communication with the team. Sometimes you feel things on the car but then on TV, or on the pit lane, there are different ideas, so you need that feedback: engineer-driver. And yeah, it was a difficult day but we have a strong chance tomorrow to score many points. So, I'm happy. I think on the new parts, early days, still under evaluation, and I think we still need to optimise a little bit the set-up of the car now with the new package, which is what we found yesterday, that I think in Austria or Silverstone, we will extract the maximum of it. Yesterday was too short an FP2. But happy: the new parts were good and delivering what we were expecting. So that's another very good sign. And let's see tomorrow in a dry race if we can challenge Max a little bit. I don't think that we are at that level, that's for sure but in a state of being 20 seconds behind or 30 seconds behind, hopefully we are a little bit closer. Yeah, I'm very happy. I'm just thinking that when you are close to the line for two times on this red flag, if you finish with a little bit of different tastes, but if I see the results and I see Checo starting at the back tomorrow. Also, Charles not in the top 10, obviously it’s a massive opportunity for us in terms of points for the Constructors, and also for the Drivers eventually if Checo is not scoring too many points. Yeah, I don't know really. Especially this year, the conditions were changing a lot and position yourself at the end of the pit lane, in the first couple of cars; I think it did help as well which I think this weekend, for example, we are on the wrong side of the pit lane. Sometimes we took advantage of being on the good side. So all these details can make a difference when the conditions are changing so much. I think confidence in the car is the key and yeah, I had a lot of confidence this year and last year.",Canada,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I think so. I think even before the race happened, or at the race, we knew what our limitations were going to be. And yeah, Sunday proved to be correct in what we thought would happen. So yeah, I think we understand where we need to work and where we need to improve, and now it's just about delivering on that. It was nice. Another day in an F1 car is always a good day. Well, I haven't been to Budapest in an F2 car either. It had been a while since I'd been there. But no, cool track in an F1 car, especially with a lot of high-speed corners to really feel the limits of an F1 car. So yeah, it was a fun day out. Yeah, I think pretty normal, to be honest, nothing too much more. I've played the track when I was growing up on the F1 video games. So yeah, I'm looking forward to it. It looks cool. It looks quite bumpy and a bit dusty. And obviously a lot of weather hanging around. So we'll see how it goes. But I'm looking forward to getting out there. I was going to say the exact same thing back. No, looking forward to it, should be good. I'll try and watch it where I can obviously. It's a bit of a shame all the F1 races clash with all the games, but I'm looking forward to seeing Australia smash you guys. I haven't driven in the simulator yet. So I'm not sure. Hopefully, it's faster. That's obviously the plan. I think we're positive and optimistic about the new package we've got coming for Austria and Silverstone. We'll have to wait and see but I'm looking forward to firstly driving it in the sim when I have the chance and then obviously on the real track too. You asked me about Indy last time! Yes, I think a similar answer to what Charles said. Obviously, with more and more races in the calendar, becomes difficult. Obviously, I'm only seven races into my F1 career, so maybe give it some more time. But it looks like an exciting race. But yeah, not for a while. Yeah, I think driving anything can be useful. I say that: I've never actually driven a race car with a roof on it before! So, I don't know, maybe it'll be a summer activity for me! I think you can look at it from both ways. Obviously F1 is a very different car from anything else. And there's quite a lot of specifics. But at the same time, you can, as Alex and Fernando were saying, you can learn different things that can help you in situations where you might not expect so yeah, I think it can be useful, but like we've all said, there's not much time to do it these days.",Canada,thursday,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"I’ve said it many times now, I think it's an incredible race and of course I would love to participate one day. I don't know when, but I would love to. It was incredible. It was the first time for me attending the race. Obviously, it couldn’t have ended up better, with Ferrari winning. But just the whole event is crazy. By night, the first six hours were crazy with the weather too, and rain, no rain. So it was very, very exciting. And I think the last time I went to see a race as a spectator was a very, very long time ago, too. So it was good. Until 4.30 in the morning, I slept like four hours. So it was okay. Yeah, it was a very difficult weekend for me especially. On this track we don't have anything new, so I don't think we'll have any miracles, but we need to just try and maximise our package, understand more this package, the way we should set up the car in order to maximise it, as in Spain we were quite easily off the window and then we were losing quite a lot of performance. So we've learnt a lot. And I'm pretty sure we'll be in a better place for this weekend. But I don't think it will be a huge step forward. No, no, we didn't. Well, last year we were in a very different situation and again, I think we expect Aston Martin to be very strong this weekend. We expect Red Bull to be very strong this weekend. We struggle to understand exactly where Mercedes will be compared to us. But again, we have to focus on ourselves and try to maximise our package. It's a very challenging track, with the weather, also, we don't really know which side it is going to go. So yeah, we'll just focus on ourselves and see what we can do. I mean, overall, I think all the team is not satisfied with the performance we are showing at the moment on track. And it's very far off our expectations at the beginning of the season. And yes, we are very clear with ourselves and it's very clear for us. Then, qualifying in Barcelona was a very particular one. I think I wasn't the only one to struggle, and we need to understand these things. And for now, we don't have the reason. So this is a little bit more worrying, and that's where we need to push and try to understand the reason for it. Because obviously, the feeling was really bad. And then, looking ahead, we just need to keep pushing, trying to bring upgrades as quickly as possible and regularly, which is our aim now, to try to close the gap with the guys in front and also to close the gap, especially in terms of race pace. Because even though I struggled a lot in Qualifying on the Saturday, the Sunday wasn't great either. And if we look, Carlos, who had a great weekend, he had a great Saturday, but then on Sunday, we struggled again with a race pace. So that's where we are trying to, to push at the moment. What gives me confidence, though, is that there's a clear direction in where we want to work and improve and this is what makes me believe in the project. Oh, it’s… I think it's too early and I don't have all the answers for now. I have to say that in the conditions that I had during the test, it was good, and it went well. But yeah, in lower temperatures, I don't know. I haven't tested these tyres in lower temperatures and that's where the big question mark is. So, very difficult to answer whether I will be happy to go. I would like to maybe test those tyres in different conditions and then see whether they are raceable in all conditions. But again, it was a positive test with the conditions that we've had in Barcelona. Well, you've got four or five corners where it's very tricky. Where the tyres need to get into temperature. When you are alone on track it is not that much of a problem. But of course, if you are racing other cars, then it becomes very, very difficult to manage. If it remains four or five corners, even in low conditions, then it's something that we could consider. But obviously with very low conditions, I expect this to be much longer, this warm-up period, and this then could become difficult. I mean, with more and more races in Formula 1, it starts to become more and more difficult, I think, to fit another race, in another category where you need to do testing, etc. So, if the calendar lets me do it, why not? But at the moment, it looks difficult. Then, I don't know, not much surprise me. I think I kind of expected all of what I've seen, at least in the way the team is working. But the excitement around the race in itself was incredible to see. I've never seen so many people on a racetrack before. And it's a very long track and wherever you go, you see lots and lots of people, and very passionate about racing and you know that it's not the first race they are watching: they've been watching for years. It's good to see so many passionate people at the same event, and on that I was surprised, yes. Yeah, well, to be honest, it is the first time that it happened in my career. I mean, if I look on the left-hand corners, that's where I was struggling. I said it straightaway after Qualifying, and we can see that on data clearly. I'm losing some six-and-a-half or seven-tenths in all the left-hand corner – but there are no real reasons for it yet. So yeah, for now, I cannot say much more, to be honest. Yeah, I think I will take it more as a challenge. I don't know how much we can take from endurance driving to Formula 1 as it's very, very different. As Fernando says, it always helps to be behind the wheel but yeah, before I was saying that it was going to be difficult, mostly because outside of the races, we also have quite a lot of events and things going on with Ferrari. So not much free time, and the free time that we have, when we have two or three days, obviously Le Mans is a very tiring race: when I saw the drivers at the end of the race, they were really, really tired: not much sleep and a lot of driving. So it's nice, I would love to do it one day, but you also need to think about the whole season and Formula 1 is obviously the main priority for now.",Canada,thursday,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"Yes, why not? Let's see, I think it should be a good weekend. But you never know until you hit the track. We also had expectations in Barcelona and we didn't perform in that race. So yeah, let's see. We have a couple of new parts in the car as well for this race, so depending on the weather, we will try to test them and validate them. And yeah, hopefully we can be a little bit more competitive than Barcelona. Always trying to improve a little bit. Our car has been a completely new project for Aston Martin, a completely new philosophy, a new concept of how the car worked. And, yeah, we've been discovering things at every race this year. And I think it's an optimisation of the package, what we try to do, and we've been constantly bringing new parts to the races and this is another step forward and more to come in the future. You never know. But it is an aggressive target for the weekend. But we know Lawrence, you know, the ambition of him is super high, always. And we will try to make him happy and proud in the home Grand Prix. I think you need to have, obviously, confidence in the car. It’s a semi-street circuit, so you get very close to the walls and you need to ride the kerbs as well. Very aggressive, very bumpy circuit. Weather normally plays a big factor here, as it will do again this weekend. And get some experience, it's always good. It’s the 17th or 18th Canadian Grand Prix, so it always helps. I don't think it would change much the show. I think it's more the size of the cars than the weight of the cars, which makes things a little bit more difficult, overtakings, fights into the first couple of corners in the race, it is difficult now to position the car, just because the size of it, not because the weight of the car. So I think it's going to be difficult to really reduce, significantly, the weight of course, as the hybrid engines, they will always be heavier than the normal engines and the safety on these cars is a lot higher as well. So I know there is some interest in going into that direction. Let's see what they can do. It will be always welcome and it's always more fun to drive light cars, but at the end of the day, I think it's more the size of them that makes racing a little bit more difficult. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. I think it was more the reaction after Barcelona, knowing that probably was more a one-off, that we were uncompetitive, than being in Canada, you know, our best chance. I think we will be, hopefully, on a very competitive position all throughout the year, and maybe only Barcelona being a little bit out of pace. So that's the hope. But I don't think that we point at one weekend, here in Canada or any other has the biggest chance of winning, Probably Monaco was, to be honest, in our calendar, our best chance and we were very close: only 40 or 50 milliseconds off pole position, and then in the race, obviously the chance with the weather coming at the end. So, let's see when we have another opportunity. Well, I think it depends on the tyre energy that you put on that specific circuit. Barcelona will help the tyres, some others, it will make things very difficult. Indy, I think you put a lot of energy in the tyres immediately and it was fine. At places like Monaco, or some others… I'm not a big fan of removing the blankets, to be honest, and I don't see the reason why. Yeah, I know Lance from 2012. Actually, I met him here in one of the Ferrari events, when he was in the Academy. I think Lance is showing the speed in the car, the commitment, we saw at the beginning of the year as well, racing with a broken hand and things like that. You only see when you really have passion for something that you're doing. And I think, for him, the most important thing now is to get the consistency, weekend after weekend. I think we saw many times in the past, sparks of Lance, in wet qualifying, in races, at the starts, lap one performance, these kinds of things that are outstanding. And then, some other weekends that the result was not coming or you get in a bad loop in Qualifying, so something like that, and then the weekend is a little bit compromised. So, I think that consistency is going to be the next step in his career, to be constantly fighting for the top five and then at the end of the year, you see the amount of points that you gain when you get all the weekends right. But as I said, with the motivation, the commitment that he has, and the team that Aston Martin is building now, I think it's a matter of time that this will come. I may go, yeah. No, you can. I did the endurance world championship and Formula One World Championship. I think both Championships, so why not one race only? I did in 2018, and it was very long already. Yeah, I agree. You know my opinion: the more you race, the more you drive, the better you are.  Instead of being in a restaurant or on a beach, or on an event or premier or whatever. If you are behind a wheel, that will be to your advantage at one point in your career: at one point in a corner or race start, or something. It will always be something that you put in your hard disk.",Canada,thursday,Aston Martin
Alex Albon,"I kind of like these kinds of circuits. I do feel there's a little bit more in terms of the ride. Maybe not so much just pure downforce on the car. There's a bit more to it. The weather… So, we've got some upgrades coming this weekend, hopefully, in some ways we want it to be dry just to see what they do. But as I said, it does seem like a bit more of a characterful track than Barcelona. Yeah, we've been pretty hard at work the last couple of weeks. You know, nothing too big actually, balance-wise. It feels quite similar. It's more just a general downforce difference. We've done a good job. I do think it's going to put us more into the fight with the midfield. Something which we've been falling away a little bit from the last few races, so hopefully you can just get us back into the fighting area for points. Silverstone I think is one of everyone's favourite circuits. Like you said, I think it's a bit more representative to see where our package comes out. We've still got Austria before then if I've got my calendar, right. But no, it will be good. I think it's also Williams’… well, it was supposed to be their 800th – but it will be 799 with Imola, unfortunately, but it will still be a good race and hopefully we can put on a good show. It's always good to go to Silverstone. I would love to, yeah.  I'm not sure. Maybe post-F1, or even during but it's exciting. I think the racing was really good. I don't know if the other drivers watched it but it was quite cool to follow along. And I like this whole new LMP style, lot of manufacturers coming into it. I didn't have the official channel, so I was just going on some dodgy livestream! It was intermittent, coming on and off all the time, so total, maybe three hours. Yeah, I think the same as Valtteri. Everyone's individual, but the way I see it is a little bit like… I did DTM, for example. Very different cars, and maybe not the most fun cars to drive but you learn such a different way to drive quickly. Every car has a different style and if you just drive Formula 1 all the time, I think you get fixed on one kind of style. Call it like reading a book: kind of extend your vocabulary, but it's more like you're racing vocabulary: you get a better appreciation for how to be on the limit and how to be quick in all different kinds of things.",Canada,thursday,Williams
Valtteri Bottas,"I think James is obviously very welcome to the team. He's got lots of experience from different teams before, been in different situations. So yeah, I think he's going to be a good addition for us and looking forward to starting to work with him. The basic things are there. There's always room for improvements and you could always get the latest machinery for every single department. So I think there's still work going on to see where to invest, when to invest, because there's a clear long-term plan. But then in the end, it's also about human power, like you said, so we're getting there step by step, but it is a project. Hopefully points. I think that's a realistic target. We had a car in Barcelona to be in the top 10. So let's see how we go here. Very different track, but we try the best and we're here to fight for points. Why not one day? I? I feel like Charles: it is tricky with the commitments we have in Formula 1. It’s only the races, it’s the other as well. So, time-wise, challenging. So, I'll probably say post-F1, could be something. That's very likely. I feel like it's quite individual as a driver. But for me, doing other things sometimes, I feel a benefit. You know, you get another point of view of driving. For example, I've done a few rallies over the last few years, some test days for it as well. Just the timing needs to be correct. So yeah, I feel like when you drive something else, you can always unlock and discover something. Especially in the winter-time, it kind of keeps you sharp if you do something else.",Canada,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon, everyone. I don't know. I think it's one of the drivers’ favourite circuits, I think, for sure. It’s the city, it’s the energy. I was asking one of the Canadians recently if the city is the same when we're not here. But the energy is always great. Got a great and amazing crowd since the beginning. And the track, you’ve got these long, long straights, but it's a bit like a go-kart track in how you have to throw the car over the kerbs. It’s just always gelled well with me. It’s a big, big braking circuit and that's always been my strength since I was younger. Clearly! Yeah, definitely a lot, that we've been making progress and the car, last race, we’ve all been buzzing, I think, back at the factory and the whole team has this new energy and kind-of feels like we've got a North Star: we know where we're going; we know how to get there. So, everyone's just churning away and working as hard as possible. So, excited to come here. I'm hoping that… we generally don't know whether this track suits our car, and the car’s characteristics, but the weather may change that and we'll see. I don't think I need to! Those clouds are looking pretty big outside! We’ve never hooked-up! No, we never have pizza! I've seen Toto, we've talked several times, we have a great relationship but there’s nothing else to say at the moment. Yeah… but nothing else new to really add to it. How old are you? 30! I think it’s the beard. Yeah, I don't feel any weight. We've gone through a tough patch and we're kind of, like, on that up. And I feel that there's been a feeling of like… For example, the last race and some of the races, it feels like we've had wins. It's just about perspective. Of course, we've not been in first place but there have been many wins in the steps that we've taken. Last race, for us, as a team, to be on the podium with both drivers, that was a win for us. And so we're just focused. We know, as I was just saying earlier, that we have that north star. We know where we need to go. We don't know everything of how to get there but we know that together we can get there if we just keep our heads down and focus on the science. The engineering team is fantastic within the organisation. We've got great development team and I honestly think we've got the best development rate, as good if not better than any team in the sport and so you’ve just got to keep chipping away. Yeah, I think we already covered a lot of that already in the previous contract and so it's really… we've got an amazing group of people back at the factory who are really refocused on D&I and really, there's been huge progress within our team since the first time we've had the conversations, like the serious conversations, and the work that we're doing with Accelerate 25, Ignite, which is now within Mission 44. And that's really my role within Mission 44. And I think the team is always super supportive. I don't know when you're referring to, to be honest, maybe the Forbes thing you mean? Yeah. That's still always going to be a focal point and the important thing, obviously, Mission 44 I think, I'm really proud of where we got it to. We’re now funding, I think it's 25 or 26 different organisations out there, so starting to really start to have impact and see… Hopefully, we'll start to see a better, fresher chain coming through from with more diverse students. 2017. Jeez, I don't remember it. Yeah, I really can't remember off the top of my head. I need to see a video or something like that. I've got a bad memory. But for me, it was very, very surreal just that being five years old, watching with my dad and the dream was to be like Ayrton. The dream was to get to Formula 1 and do something like him and then to then find that you're matching equally in terms of results. You know, ultimately it's unfair because there's a lot more races in our time than there were back then. But still it was a real honour. I think I got it, they gave me a helmet or something like that, replica helmet, something like that, and so that was very cool. Yeah, Max has been doing an amazing job. He's had such an incredible career so far and he's for sure going to surpass that. (We’re) working on getting the car to where it needs to be so we can slow him down. Similar. I think the dimensions are pretty good. I quite like the size of the car but obviously there are some places where it is tight as Checo said. But I think it is the weight that has definitely gone too far. Our wheels this year are a ridiculous weight. And there's just no need. We've had light wheels in the past, and then the cars, just the braking zones are longer but I definitely think there's some good changes they can make for the future. It's not my decision, obviously. He's got a very long career ahead of him so absolutely. Ultimately, records are there to be broken. And he's got an amazing team. But as I said, we’ve got to work harder to try and continue to extend it. I hope we get to have some… at least within the last period of time in my career, I hope we get to have some more close racing. And then I don't really have a huge amount to say on the contractual side of things. It'll get done when it's done. If that's next week, if that's in a month's time, as long as it gets done I’m not really bothered. Yeah, super excited to get to have the British Grand Prix. Hope… the weather has been amazing in the past week or so. When I left I think it was 29 degrees which was amazing. So let's hope that that extends out to when we get there. And yeah, I'm really, really hopeful that the performance we had in the last race… I mean, we're only like three tenths off… each lap, I was around three or four tenths off Max, which was the closest I think we've ever been this year. And I'm hoping by then, we will hopefully have taken another step. So I'm really, really hopeful that we can… maybe that will be a race where we get to actually race them but we'll see.",Canada,thursday,Mercedes
Kevin Magnussen,"Yeah, I mean, it always… when you think back, 150 races, it sounds like a lot but it actually doesn't feel like that much. I always get surprised when new guys come into F1, and I see their age and I think about my own age and suddenly feel quite old! Actually, I feel young still, but time flies and I'm not a youngster anymore. I’m 30. Were you surprised I wasn’t older, or…? So, I look old! People say I look older than my Dad! I've seen that on the Internet. But no, it's been a really fun ride, and it doesn't feel like it's anywhere near over yet. And yeah, I'm excited to be around still, and excited for the future. Yeah, it was a tricky one because it was so up and down, you know? One session, we were close to top five and the next one, we were out-in-Q1 range, and it was going up and down so much that it was…  we made small changes to the car that we didn't think was going to be big and it had a very big effect. So, it was a little bit of a confusing weekend. And you know, it obviously ended up not being a great one in the race too, with a lot of tyre wear and degradation. So, I'm hoping that we can find some actual answers that we can carry forward and avoid falling into the same trap. Yeah, I do agree. I mean, at the end of the day, Sundays are the most important. If you have a fast car on Saturday, it doesn't really matter if you're really wearing out the tyres or just not fast on Sunday. So, that is clearly the priority: to find the pace on Sunday. It has been good in races this year, but it's been a little bit up and down. Too much up and down. That’s clearly what we need to work on. I don't know about that. We have been struggling a little bit when it's been bumpy and you know, this track is a bumpy one. And you're also using the kerbs in all the chicanes and I don't know if that's going to suit us that well – but you often get surprised anyway and we'll see.",Canada,thursday,Haas
Yuki Tsunoda,"I'm still upset with it but you cannot change anything. In the end, that's what the FIA decided and actually, we spoke this afternoon with the FIA and understand their perspective. Other than that, nothing to say. I won’t change any approach, I would say, to be honest. In the end I will try as much as possible to defend it, within the limit. I thought it was in the limit and it was not – but in the end, it was using too much and you cannot defend, so, obviously I’ll try to change a little bit better. There’s room that I can improve in any situation. I feel, at the same time, a similar mindset to after the race, I felt quite harsh, but in the end it is what it is, and yeah, I just have to accept it. I’ve compared this track to Suzuka? It's not similar at all! Ah, OK, yeah. Well, Suzuka, we don't drive kerbs, and here we drive kerbs. And it’s a street circuit here and not a street circuit in Suzuka, so… I don’t know. I was not in a good mood when I said that, or whatever! But yeah, I mean, in terms of there being grass next to the track surface is quite similar to Suzuka, which is challenging and still thrilling, and once you step-out, it’s quite costly. But if you compare to Suzuka, it’s not similar at all. So, it's hard to say more than this but I try to maximise the lap-time within the grass. Yeah, I think so. I mean, especially race pace, we've been positive consistently this year. So I try to maximise that, and one of our limitations now is a qualifying, try to extract as much as possible, end up as high position as much as possible, to be slightly easier than starting P15 or whatever. That's our probable main challenge for this week. And I'm feeling positive. I think, so far, bumpy track is not too bad. Monaco, we performed quite well. So, feeling optimistic. I’ll try my best. I think weather will be a slight game changer and affect our strategy and pace, so see how it goes. Yeah, definitely. First of all, we knew each other already. I got introduced by Mr Yamamoto from Honda in 2021, in Monaco. Since then, we keep in touch, just casually and we get along quite well. But same time we didn't actually work together, and I approached to him last year around Abu Dhabi. And yeah, so far he's doing the job that I wanted him to do and I'm really, really happy with him. Not just… I mean, managing just as a kind of friendship side, he's really good and I feel like I can rely on him quite a lot. So yeah, I can trust him a lot, which is a good thing which is an important thing. And yeah, I feel quite happy with him.",Canada,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, it was quite nice to just have like a weekend to recharge back home and I'm quite a sports enthusiast, so I must say I quite enjoyed between MotoGP, 24 hours of Le Mans, Roland Garros, there was the Champions League final. So, I definitely enjoyed watching and following all that. And then we had a nice bowling event last night with the team, so it was pretty fun to just catch up and bond with the team members outside the race track. Yeah, Djokovic, it was just incredible to witness. He won his 23rd Grand Slam and it was just impressive, just mentally and how strong his game was. Definitely I enjoyed it. Yeah, obviously. I think it had a very bad impact, obviously, on our weekend, from Qualifying, for us to start P10 and drop to P14 on lap one, so it was definitely a pretty terrible start. But yeah, there are always things we can do better. There were small mistakes, which were done in Quali, which we reviewed and will improve in terms of procedure and communication. And yeah, it was a harsh penalty. Unfortunately, there is a regulation, which is applied most of the time and then we paid a pretty big price. I think the last three events have been pretty strong in terms of evolution and progress. We've scored points with both cars in these last three events. Miami was a step forward. Monaco, there was obviously a podium. Barcelona, we showed strong pace in Quali, with a fourth in Qualifying and again double points. So there are definitely positives. There are small details we need to work on to really make a step on Sundays, but overall, I think we’ve got decent potential in our package and I'm confident we can get a strong result again this weekend. Well, I think that the team last year showed really good progress and evolution with the upgrades throughout the entire season. And I think it was probably the strongest strength throughout the whole year. So I trusted in the team to improve the performance. We had a pretty slow start of the year, probably starting on the back foot and a bit further away from the competition than we would have liked. But clearly, I think it's fair to say it came as a bit of a positive surprise that in Monaco we were able to fight for the podium. In Barcelona, again, top four in Qualifying, so there seems to be definitely some very good potential to unlock from the package we’ve got and that's why I'm pretty confident in the coming races. The coming weekends, I think there are definitely some big points to get as a team.",Canada,thursday,Alpine
Sergio Pérez,"It was difficult in Barcelona. It is the only time that I have difficulties with the car. I did struggle through the weekend, so it was tricky in Barcelona. But other than that, I think in Monaco we had the pace to really have a very good weekend but I did a mistake. I was caught out with a tailwind, with a car ahead and so on. No, I think the first time we had difficulties was in Barcelona. I don't think so. I think we always have to deliver to our maximum and we just have to make sure we deliver. We have a great car and we should be having a lot of podiums, wins and so on, from now until the end of the year. We can see that the competition is getting closer and closer all the time, but we will try our best. It's a tricky race track. We've seen in Barcelona things are getting closer and certainly there's always one or two teams that can get really close. And especially with how the weekend is looking, it's looking really damp, so it will only get things a little bit closer. Well, I think he has been able to deliver when it matters – in Qualifying and he hasn't had a bad weekend at all this year. And I think it's what I need. I cannot afford to have any bad weekends anymore. I think I've had two or three bad weekends in the season, so I really have to get rid of those and keep the consistency high because I think it's something that Max has been really good and consistent throughout this period. Well, I think the dimensions of this car, probably they have an impact in places like Monaco, where it just gets harder to do racing. But other than that, I do think that the tyres, the size of the car are probably a little bit too big. Although we can follow a bit better, it seems a bit better to protect, defend your position. So I would welcome a lighter car as well but I don't think it's a main issue to me. It's also the size of the car that is hurting a bit the racing side.",Canada,thursday,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"I mean, it's a big pleasure, you know, to drive with a car like this. And I think yeah, it showed again today. I mean, we had quite a lot of different types of strategies out there. I think for most of the race, we were on the right one. But yeah, again, a win here it's incredible. I had the harder compound, of course, and I knew the start was maybe going to be a bit tricky. And yeah, going around the outside into Turn 1 is always quite difficult but luckily, nothing happened. I mean, we had another strong weekend and that’s what I like to see for myself from the team. And hopefully, you know, we can just keep that up throughout the year. I think it was important to try to keep the lead in Turn 1. I know it's quite tight. But actually, we had a very good start. And then from there onwards I just tried to manage the pace on the Medium. I knew everyone behind me mainly was on a Soft, and I think especially in those last eight laps of that stint I could really create a big gap. And then, of course, we went onto the Hard tyre. And I actually expected them to be a little bit better. But somehow, they just didn't have a lot of grip and I was actually sliding around quite a bit. The pace was still OK, but I couldn't really create much more of a gap, not how I would have liked. But then of course, we just did the amount of laps we had to do on that tyre and then we pitted again for the Soft and that actually felt a lot nicer to drive. Yeah, for me it was just very close between a Medium or Soft. The life of a Medium is probably a little bit better than the Soft tyre. That's why I decided to start on the Medium. I guess so. If you had to try and catch up, let's say, probably yes. But it's not necessary. It's all about managing your tyres trying to reach the stint length. Yeah, I went over the white line three times. It happens sometimes. Some tracks it's a bit easier to do and I was struggling a little bit with the harder tyres to keep it within the white lines. But once I had that last warning then I had to keep it within the white lines. But it's not an issue really. It's a good period. But you know, we have to keep on working and trying to find more performance. I'm happy in the car. And I think the last few race weekends have definitely been a lot more positive for me. But this is one weekend where I think it went really well. But we also know that maybe some other tracks it's not like this, you know, so a lot of races to come where we again have to perform really well to try and win the race. It was a worse Medium, to be on the same kind of deg and it was just sliding a lot more. And once I felt that, you just have to do your laps on it. Then of course, luckily we had another pit stop but it was definitely not the most enjoyable stint I’ve ever done in my life – but luckily the car is still fast, so you don’t really lose time. I didn’t expect that with this Hard compound but sometimes you have these surprises. Like I said, it wasn’t as enjoyable and probably a little bit harder to drive. I think they had a very strong race, to be honest. I think they are improving but from our side, it’s not about being worried. We just have to focus on ourselves, trying to keep on improving the car. At the moment it all looks great but you can’t’ stand still in this world. We just keep trying to find things on the car, try to learn – like today understand why the Hard wasn’t working with the car. And yeah, we’ll see what happens in the coming races. I don’t know if there are going to be tracks that are better or worse. We’ll find out. To be honest, these are all question marks I cannot really answer because it can be track-dependent. I didn't know. That looks good. (Lewis puts sunglasses on) Maybe we come here with our helmets on next time? But honestly I can't answer that question because I don't know and also why did Checo not finish second? I don't know. Well, I kept it within the white lines, I just went a bit faster on the lap. So I didn't do anything wrong. They don't know how much pace I have in the car, right, when they tell me this is the fastest lap, don't bother, but I knew that I could do it. So yeah, I just had to keep it within the white lines but this is something I think we can laugh about already. I was laughing about it with Helmut after the race so I'm pretty sure that they're quite happy. You will get the meme now, when you said that with the glasses, looking cool. Just imagine it the other way around? I mean it would have been the same story. So yeah, I defend my position like they would have defended their position. So I think it's quite straightforward. Yeah, I think it's great for the sport in general, right, if you have more teams fighting upfront. That's, I think, what they want to achieve so honestly that would be amazing, to have more drivers really up there, and hopefully throughout the year it will already get closer and maybe next year there are more teams really up there.",Spain,post-race,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Man, what an awesome crowd we have here, like every year. Gracias to everyone here in Barcelona. What a result for our team! We definitely didn't expect to have the result we had today. So I just really wanted to take my hat off to my team. A big, big thank you to everyone back at the factory for continuing to push and for bringing us a little bit closer to the Bulls. They're still a bit ahead, but we will keep chasing them down. But this is an amazing result. George did a great job today as well. They are a little bit too quick at the moment. But we're working at it. So just one step at a time. And if we can get close by the end of the year, that'd be awesome. But if not, next year. Flat out. No lifting. This one was very special. I think we got a great reception from the crowd here and to be able to share the podium with my team-mate I think it's really special, given just the journey that we've been on together to try to close the gap to the guys ahead. This is a really amazing day for us. The car felt great today. Friday was a real struggle with the balance, it was way out of the window. It was very hard to drive, very unpredictable. And then we did some great work overnight. We’ve got a great team, with Mick back in the simulator on Friday night and he did some great work, which helped us get on the right track on Saturday. I think we did pretty decent work in trying to understand the different downforce levels. And in the race today the car felt great. But honestly I just couldn't match the times that Max was doing. And for George to come from 12th to third is just remarkable. So, really awesome result for us as a team. Yep! I mean, they normally say if you’re quick in Barcelona then the car should generally be good everywhere, but I think we will be strong in the next races. There will be times when the Aston may be slightly ahead, or the Ferrari maybe is ahead but I think our race pace continues to be a strength of ours, as it was last year. And now I think this weekend particularly, we’ve understood the car even more. So, I think we can count on that being strong moving forward. We’ve just got to try to lift the overall performance of the car a little bit more to try to close the gap to these guys. I just felt a big hit from behind but obviously Max and Carlos went quite wide and deep into Turn 1 and then they were coming back across, and I basically got in the wake, so I had to be patient, and then I got a hit from behind. I think it was a shame for Lando because he did such an amazing job yesterday. It’s great to see McLaren up there on the second row and I think today even if he was ahead of me going into the corner, we would have overtaken him because we had slightly more pace race trim-wise. And so yeah, not ended up being a great result for him but I think if he was just a little more patient today, he would have had probably a better result but we live and we learn. With the current car that we have, I don’t think we’ll be matching their performance but we’re working on improving the car. So, with the current package we’re limited to the pace that we had today, but I think there’s a huge amount of work and studying and improvement that we hopefully will have coming in the future. Naturally, they should also be progressing through the year, so we need to be taking big chunks out of them with every step we take. I think today they were a good few tenths ahead of us. Maybe half a second ahead of us per lap – and on a single lap, that’s a little bit bigger – but I think we’re going in the right direction and I know we have something in the pipeline moving forward, so I’m hoping that at least by the end of the year, maybe we can could challenge them. I’m more focused on making sure next year we have the car to challenge them from day one. And the further we continue to push this car this year, the more that impacts next year also, in some ways. But the more we learn about this car also, that also sets us in the right direction. It’s trying to find the right balance. They’re so far ahead and ultimately Max will continue to win this year – but that means they can start on their development for next year sooner, earlier than anyone else if they haven’t already – and that’s the danger. So, we’ve just got to keep working hard but also try to get the right balance. Well, I haven’t signed anything yet but I think we’re meeting with Toto tomorrow, so hopefully we can get something done. Yeah, for me, definitely the best car’s been the past year and a half. So that's kudos to the amazing group of people we have back at the factory who continue to work hard and push the car forward. So it felt the best this weekend; it felt the best yesterday and today than it's felt for the past 14/15 months, whatever it is. And so that's super encouraging, I think not only for me but for everybody in the team. This will be a big boost for everybody's morale. And we're going to take that energy on to developing the car. Yeah, it wasn't a subtle hint. We've had so many meetings. It's just another one of the meetings that we're having. I’m keeping my glasses on because it's so bright. And yeah, you can see today my results, my performance is not affected by that. But… It's always something that's at the back of your mind so once that's done, then you're able to then focus more and think about the future , but as I said I'm working as hard as I can with this team and I see so much strength within the team, I think they’re still so hungry. On the podium today was really, really, really special to be able to see them in the distance… I saw them at the back, they’re always at the back. But to be able to see the excitement in all the people that I've worked with such a long time. And when we go back right now there'll be a great energy within the office but these guys, they'll take two seconds to enjoy themselves and be happy and then they'll be back down into the books and trying to figure out how we can win the next race so that's what I love about them. I think my hunger has never really shifted, I would say. No, don't feel like that's… I think I'm in a really great place in my life and I think I'm really happy where I am in my life and I think I've got all the ducks in a row, like where I'm able to really focus. Got a great, great, great team around me both off track and on track. There's great stuff that's happening with Mission 44 that's got a great team in London, working on that. And we're starting to see impact. I've got a great team of engineers here that… been with Bono for a long, long time and feel like Bono’s really doing… what Bono and Mike and all the guys are doing is such a such a fantastic job. And I think for me, I feel fit and healthy and I think that was a very solid, very solid race for me. And I think, yeah, I want to keep going for as long as I can. But I want to be where he is [indicating Max]. And or racing him at least. So that's super, super-focused on getting to that point and yeah, a long way to go. But there’s time,",Spain,post-race,Mercedes
George Russell,"A little bit surprised for sure, I think. Kudos to the team for giving me a really great car today. I mean, that was a fun race for us, starting from P12 and coming all the way to P3. A sign of things to come hopefully. Yeah, it definitely feels better. You know, you’re just putting in those lap times and you compare it with the guys around you – with the Astons and the Ferraris – and we were just quicker and quicker. So we know we brought some more downforce to the car. We know things are in a better window. So yeah, really pleased to be on the podium. I think after yesterday we knew it was going to be a challenge but woke up with a bit more positivity and I thought we could definitely move forward, probably fight for P5, P6. I thought P3 would be a little bit out of reach – but the car was really, really great today; the team did a great job with the strategy and it was a really satisfying race, making some good moves on the people around me. Huge thanks to the whole team for bringing these updates forward but equally, we’re not going to get carried away just after this one race, because we know it might be slightly different in the future races, and I think generally Aston and Ferrari were a little bit more off the pace than normal. I think quite early on, to be honest. Even after that first stint I believed it was possible when I saw the other cars peeling into the pits: my tyres were feeling good; the car was feeling good, so I think even after two laps I thought, ‘you know what, we can do this today’. Today it was feeling really strong but we know we’ve got more improvements to be made. A little bit cooler today, which maybe played into our favour. We know our race pace is good but certainly we need to make a big step forward to catch-up the Red Bulls and we’re not solely satisfied with P2 and P3. Although it’s a good step forward, we’ve got our sights set right at the very top. Yeah, I think so, but we go to so many different circuits. The car naturally feels really, really strong. A lot of these new circuits with the new tarmac and when you go to a track like here or Bahrain, there's a lot of tyre deg. Today, it probably felt the best it's ever felt around Barcelona because of the cooler conditions. But definitely this season, probably the best it's felt, the most together it's felt and as Lewis said, the team’s done a really, really great job. The work that Mick and the simulator team are doing overnight, they were there well past midnight to help us with the setup and get it in a good window for the race today. So we are making strides in the right direction. We just need to make sure, especially into next year, that we hit the ground running because I think we as a team probably develop faster than anybody else. Firstly with the sweat, I had my hair dangling down in the first stint, I think I didn’t quite get it in my balaclava and that was annoying me because it was in my peripheral vision. And then as I was sweating because it wasn't in my balaclava, it was dripping down onto my face. And then when I was braking, it was coming onto my visor so with the grey clouds, and then the spots of water on the visor I thought it was rain. So that was a bit of a bit of an embarrassing one. But moving on. And then no, I think it was just a bit of a joke with Marcus, because we have a bit of back and forth I think. Toto likes the big radio messages of encouragement. And Marcus and I sometimes say… just be nice and calm in a situation is sometimes the best way to get the result. But yeah, it was a pretty decent move on Carlos and yeah, I thought it was a little bit more than solid, but it's just good laugh.",Spain,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"The car was really good. I mean, of course, you know, Qualifying started off a bit tricky with the weather. But, you know, once it started to dry out and now in Q3 as well, yeah, the car was on rails, and it was really, really enjoyable to drive today. Yeah, I mean, I love coming to Barcelona in general. I love the track. I love the fans. You know, they really love racing. And I had a lot of great memories here and hopefully tomorrow we can add another one. Yeah, I think overall, you know, the whole weekend it has been really enjoyable to drive the car. It was really hooked up. Of course you always try to find little improvements on the car. But yeah, it's been really good. Of course, qualifying started off a little bit tricky. You needed to be on the track at the right time, not making mistakes. But we did that. And of course going into Q3 I knew there was quite a bit of potential left in the car, so I could finally push it to the limit in that first run and the car was really quick. Then, of course, we went out again for the second run and that would have been even better. But, yeah, I think GP got a bit excited! He told me to abort. Yeah, it was. I was going faster going into Turn 10. I have to say from the start, the car was pretty good. I mean, I only made tiny little adjustments, but I felt comfortable straight away: long runs, short runs. I mean, it’s never easy to get to the limit in a Formula 1 car but it’s just been very enjoyable to drive, it gives you a lot of confidence and when you have all that, you can really push it to the limit. I think wear is always high around here so, for sure, with another two fast right-handers that won’t help the wear – but it’s a lot more enjoyable to drive. I mean, going into that last corner brings a smile on my face because that’s where an F1 car really comes alive. Well, I mean, I am where I expected to be, going into this weekend. And I mean, to be honest, I also expected Carlos to be there. I just didn't expect Lando to be there, but that's a good surprise. Well, no, sorry. I didn't expect McLaren to be there. Sorry, I have to rephrase. I always expect Lando to be high up. The Alpine looks good but there have been lately improving quite a bit. So, for me, there are no real big shocks, I would say. No, I was just to save the tyres. Maybe we need it tomorrow, you don't know. So we already said that in the garage that if they wouldn't, of course, be in front of me then maybe we wouldn't complete the lap. So that's what we did. And yeah, unfortunately, the last corner wasn't flat for me. Never really got to try it. Maybe I would have tried on the last lap. Who knows? It sometimes just comes up when you get into the corner you’re like ‘maybe it's flat’. But I think FP2 was quite close. Unfortunately we can’t try that tomorrow. Well, I mean, we can try it but then you won’t make the corner. But you want me to try that one? Yeah, over time cars are improving so I think next year, if we come back, then probably it's flat. I mean, realistically it’s only one corner. You know, the other corner is flat out for everyone. I don't think it hurts us. And then also for the tyre wear, yeah, in general, it's high so even if we would have had the other layout, I don't think it would have been very, very different in terms of looking after your tyres. But yeah, we know that we are normally good on tyre deg and hopefully we can show that again tomorrow. It's like my hobby but I take it very seriously. And I think it never hurts because you always test yourself. I mainly drive other kinds of cars on online platforms and F1 but you're always thinking about what can I improve also driving-wise but also setup-wise and that's what I enjoy. I go to bed probably thinking more about the simulator or like a car there than what I do sometimes in F1, just because I also want to do well there. It sometimes takes up a lot of time but I love it. And it's difficult to say if it actually helps me in Formula 1, but I definitely think it doesn't hurt. And also in your off-season you do that, but when I jump back in a Formula 1 car it feels like I never left. I think our next upgrade will be without sidepods! So then everyone can go back to that! I don't know. It's just how we designed the car but it's not only the sidepods, it's a lot of things that have to come together. And I'm not even the aero specialist there. I think we learned a lot over the years and now with the new regulation, we hit the ground running and we understood what was going on and that helps a lot. You can immediately focus on other things and hopefully, of course, we can keep that momentum going because everyone is of course pushing very hard to catch up. But also from our side, we are never satisfied, we always want more. I think in general, the high speed you know, the car has been really good. Yeah, like the combination turn one, two, three was good. Turn nine was very enjoyable. And then the last sector was OK-ish but I think the main lap time gains were probably initially like one, two, three, four and probably six. What is it, seven? Seven. It just all felt quite connected so once you have that feeling, you can really push all the entries and that gives you quite a bit of lap time around here.",Spain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah and I needed it because it was super tight. Very, very tricky conditions out there today and even getting through Q1, Q2 without any issues and putting a good lap only with one set in Q3 was probably one of the most tricky Qualis I've had here in Barcelona in terms of conditions, but we did it. I think we are in the best possible position going into tomorrow. And now we can focus on trying to get that podium tomorrow. It was very good today. I felt like I was driving very well. You know, it's always one tenth here, one tenth there but I was pushing everything. I didn't leave anything on the table today. I was pushing flat out. It was very tight, even with McLaren, with Alpine, with Mercedes, Aston. We were all in the same group, basically, this weekend. So I think P2 was as far as I could make it today and that 12.7 was pretty good today. Yeah, it feels very good as you can imagine, especially because today I really felt like we extracted everything out of the car. And it's been a bit of a tough weekend, you know, getting used to the new upgrades, getting them to work in the sweet spot of the car. We've had some trickier sessions, some easier ones but finally hooked it up in Quali, all through Q1, Q2, Q3. It felt really good progress, still not where we want to be because it's quite a big gap to Max, especially when you can see that he was coming even faster on the second lap. But at least it's our first step and we're focusing on understanding this new car. I don't know exactly what happened to Charles but it’s been the same story of the whole year. It feels like it’s a very narrow window for us; very narrow window for the car; very tricky car to drive. And as soon as the conditions get tricky, it can go one way or the other and you’re fighting very different balances and it's a very fine line for me today. It worked out okay, it was tough, because now it looks like the midfield is really starting to close-up with us. You have the likes of the Alpines, even the Haas, Lando with the McLarens are appearing and just joining us in that fight for second or third best. Obviously Red Bull are in a league of their own but then everyone else, it looks like it's really, really tight out there. Yeah, I wouldn't have minded if Lewis or Lando would have out-qualified me, because here the clean side is probably a bit better for the start but at the same time it's all about also the tow and how lucky you get, if you can get a tow or not in the run down to Turn One. Yeah, I don't know. Obviously we’ll try to give it all into Turn One and go and get that podium. And if Max does something strange, then get a win. I think it is getting a bit tight, especially since Monaco, I don't know if people who started bringing upgrades maybe to Imola… Imola didn’t happen but then to Monaco, I think maybe the field is compressing. I think also a short lap, like in Monaco and here – 1m12s – also makes it look even tighter. And also for us, honestly, I don't think it's the best track for Ferrari: a lot of high speed corners and at the moment, those are where we are struggling the most, which is our main point of focus. I think it will be still tough to get, especially Checo coming from P11 with a Red Bull. But as soon as I get back to the engineers, I think they will tell me that the simulation suggests that the Red Bull should still finish ahead of us and then it will be a fight with Lando and Mercedes, the Astons that I don't know exactly what happened to them today, but they normally have really, really good race pace. So yeah, I think it's still going to be a tough, tough call to get a podium tomorrow. So we put ourselves in the best possible position to achieve that but I still think it's going to be a good fight for it tomorrow. No, I don't and I don't expect to have. Obviously we’re starting in very different positions and I hope that he can come back through the field as fast as possible. But I don't know, I haven't seen how our race pace compares to the rest of the field. As you said or as I said, I expect Red Bull to have more than half a second to a second of race pace advantage in that window, like they always have and that around Barcelona, fifty-something laps is a lot of seconds so it doesn't matter where they're starting. But the rest of the field I think is tight and it's going to be a good fight. Well, the new package was meant to improve mainly the medium to low speed and in that area, we have definitely felt a step in the right direction. And as I said before the weekend, a step into a different direction is not so much a big upgrade or a big change in our performance but opening a bit of a different window of working range for the car. That was the main target of this upgrade, not to suddenly go half a second quicker. And yeah, I think that is doing the job and it's working well. We also want to make the car more predictable, more drivable, easier to put together a lap and hopefully it will go in this direction but unfortunately, we've come to a track that it doesn't suit our package. Our high speed performance really hasn't been good since the beginning of the season. Since Australia, we've been struggling with the balance and with the bouncing and still many things that is happening to us in high speed. So yeah, we just want to now focus on that and see if we can improve that because as you saw, low speed for us is actually not bad at all.",Spain,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"I have no idea. I am surprised to be here! Amazing job, P3. I lost P2, but it’s a home race for Carlos so I thought I would give him a couple of tenths, you know. Yeah, very happy. P3, it’s nice. The whole of Qualifying we were quite quick, so all good. I mean, it seems to be good for us. So I would say I like it. It's one of our strengths, the high-speed corners, so yeah, I'm very happy. A difficult qualifying but always in these conditions, the tricky ones, we seem to do well. They seem to suit me. I would say yes. I think after FP1, we said it was probably one of our worst FP1s of the season, in terms of pace. So to be sat here today, I think it's quite a big surprise for all of us. I think the conditions – the cooler conditions – things just started to come our way a little bit. So yeah, just feels a bit odd. I definitely wasn't thinking at all to be in the top three today. But I'm very happy to be here. So, good day. No, just small things really. I think nowadays you can get the car quite quickly in a reasonable window, is just playing around with little things here and there. No, that’s why I say it probably came a bit more towards us, rather than us, rather than us chasing too many things.  But it also felt like I did some good laps. I felt confident, let's say even with the car being a bit of a struggle, I still felt confident in maximising it and getting the most out of the car every run. Especially come qualifying, I just felt again another step of confidence. So yeah, felt good, especially when you get to see your name at the top a bit more often! It definitely just motivates you that little bit more. Good position for tomorrow. Not very! Yeah, not very. You never know, the pace could be mega and I could catch Max and overtake him. Hopefully he doesn't hold me up like in Monaco – but we'll see. It's a new day, like we didn't expect to be as good today as we were and, like Carlos said, we're on the clean side of the grid. I let him have this one because I want to make it out of the track alive tonight. So yeah, we'll do our best for tomorrow but the aim is just to get some good points for both myself and for Oscar. I mean, yeah, I'm shocked to be here. We haven’t really brought anything to the car this weekend. No, the last upgrade we had was Baku with the different floor. And even that didn't give us a lot of performance, just kind of different direction to go in. So yeah, we've not really brought too many big things, just some very, very small things that always help little bits. But the whole field just seems very close this weekend, since FP1 already. The distance to Red Bull has been – let’s say from a midfield point of view, closer than it has been. And then just everyone, you know, with the Haas, the Alpines, the Astons. And then I guess we're a bit of a surprise today. In a good way. I'm happy – but like I said, we didn't really change anything this weekend. It's the same car that we've been struggling with. So nice to see some good points from it. I tend to be always one of the first to try those things. For my own feeling and confidence, I tend to do it quite a bit. Sometimes it really doesn't work out and you can be close to crashing. But sometimes it's more just an information type of thing, in case it’s like this tomorrow, if it was a bit more say intermediate, slick in qualifying, I think I would have had a slight advantage to other people. I think I felt decent. I wouldn't say we felt anywhere near this good, and like I said on Friday, we all sat down and we were thinking it's going to be tough to get over Q1. I don't know. Sometimes we outperform that quite a bit and we do well but I think apart from maybe Bahrain, this was our worst Friday of the season so I really wasn't that hopeful. But things just seem to come together, other people struggled a bit more today than maybe us overperforming kind of thing or being our true potential. And like I said, we've not really changed the car that much so there was nothing which has given me a lot of confidence to… or any reasons why we were going to be that good today. We're still pretty poor in many areas, but high speed has always been one of our strengths for years and slow speed quite the opposite. So I think this layout has helped us, so it has benefited us a bit more. I think already FP2 was flat in turn three, flat in turn nine, probably one of the few guys apart from Red Bull who did that? So yeah, I think it’s a track where more of the strengths have been able to be shown, even though Monaco wasn't bad. We do struggle a lot in the slow speed corners so that's still the area we know we want to take big steps forward.",Spain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"Yes, I have a lot of family, obviously, that live around the circuit and, yes, my grandparents, you know, are Spanish, so for me it's almost two weekends of home races, or very close. So yeah, it feels good to come here and ready to attack the weekend. Obviously we are coming from a very good one. So yeah, I can't wait to attack this one. Thank you. Yeah, it's been pretty wild, for sure. Great to celebrate with my team. We were all out partying and, yeah, it's been awesome to just… You know, everyone got a great reward after all the hard work and a difficult start of season. So yeah, we can be all pleased with what we've achieved. Obviously, feet to the ground coming to this weekend, it's going to be a good test to see where the car is exactly after putting all these upgrades on it. And yeah, it's a track that everyone knows super well. So, looking forward to test that. I think they both had a lot of similarities. I think getting a very, very good lap in Qualifying was obviously more key in Monaco than in Budapest. But, you know, I also had a very good weekend in Budapest on the Saturday and we were very competitive. But I would say, you know, it's not a win, so it doesn't taste as good. But obviously, it's been a while since I've been on the podium, and getting it on pure merit that time to have that podium, it's something special. We're going to give it all to be able to reproduce it here, that's for sure. We're not here just to participate. But as I said, feet on the ground. It's going to be a good test for us exactly, to evaluate where we are after putting these updates on the car. And I think there's no better track to see where the car is exactly than here. Were you sick? You look a bit pale. Yeah, I mean, I think it was clear that we were not happy with how the season started. We were struggling and, you know, not scoring as much points as we really needed to. But, you know, we never stopped believing, we never stopped working the way we should, to try and get that car as high as it can go. And nothing has changed from that side and everyone was giving their maximum for it to happen. And yeah, everyone at the team deserves what has happened last weekend. All the hard work has paid off. And it shows that we can be there and, and it gives everyone more hunger to keep that going. Now that we've tasted it, obviously, that's why I'm saying we always need to aim to make it happen again. So I'm hoping is the first of many this season. But, yeah, that's what we need to look at. I'm not saying that's what's going to happen but I'm trusting the plan of Laurent Rossi and Luca de Meo, they are very competitive people and yeah, I'm fully onboard with the 100 races plan they have.",Spain,thursday,Alpine
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, obviously not a big celebration because it's a back-to-back and obviously I didn't have the result like Esteban to have a good night in Monaco. But yeah, on my side I just stayed with family back home and then to be ready for this weekend. So actually, as many of you probably know, we have the package already for Monaco but it's not very transparent for a circuit like that, because it's a one-off special track, so it will be great to be seeing where we are and turning up to a track like here, and especially with the last sector changing, and we really can see how this works for us and hopefully that it bring us a little bit one step up, which I think we feel like we needed since the very beginning of the season. I mean obviously it's good to be here but then filming days there's only a [set] amount of laps you can reach and I think you get one or two push laps and that's it. Yeah, in general it’s a track that everybody did 100 laps or 1000 laps in the sim. I'm sure everyone knows the track and it's more about the details and how much confidence you feel on the high-speed tracks but yeah, personally I do like more high speed tracks than the slow technical, a bit more like Monaco, tracks. So yeah, for me, hopefully that can play into the hands of my driving style hopefully and achieve better results than let's say the previous race. Yeah, to be honest, obviously, I drove the firstly, the 18-inch tyres, and obviously going firstly to the old one, with the 13-inch, so the difference between that and coming back to the different Formula 1 cars always in a similar direction, but the downforce, the speed you're travelling is such a big difference between the cars and the way you have to change your driving, adapting quite a lot, the cornering speed, it's quite a lot. So you have to take your time to be learning that. And I think the biggest difference is the procedure. You know, you're in control of many switch changes, during different scenarios. And then yeah, for me, it takes time obviously being up to speed. When you firstly come into F2… Formula 1 is not a car that every driver can just jump in and be so quick at the first day at the office. But in general, let's say, the way like, F2 teaches you how to drive and the way you control and looking after your tyres is the things that you still have to do when you're in Formula 1, so it's a great way to just climb from that series up. And yeah, as we see, you know, many of the drivers finished in the top three and they have the ability, or the skills, the capability to drive an F1 car and to be driving in a fast way as well. So yeah, I'm happy with what I learned from the past and taking onboard, but still plenty of learning to do and still learning day by day.",Spain,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Nico Hülkenberg,"Too many. Yeah, obviously we came here so much back In the day, winter testing, sometimes still I remember from before my F1 full-on years, testing around here. So a fair few, although I've never done this new sector, two corners different, two quick right handers, so we'll explore them tomorrow, see what it's like. But I haven't been here since 2019… Were you there? It's been four years though that I've been here, so it feels like a fresh new Grand Prix to me. Well, Monaco didn't quite go so well for us. It was a difficult weekend as a team, so we put that behind us. I think coming here, you know, fresh weekend. I think we'll get more of a clue how the update is working out. How the front wing is performing. Obviously also back to a classic or, you know, permanent race track. It feels like you know, pretty street circuit-dominated the last few Grand Prix, so nice to be at a normal track for once. I think it should suit us better, more flowing, more high speeds. You know, if you compare that with Melbourne and Jeddah, hopefully, we will be in a better position here.",Spain,thursday,Haas
Max Verstappen,"In the ‘90s they had that layout. Back in the day! You sound like it! ‘Back in the day’! Yeah, I've been on the water a little bit. Yeah, just getting to experience a bit more like towards the America's Cup, what's going to happen right? And just getting a bit of an insight as well what they have to do on the boat. Eight guys on there, which is a bit different, of course, to us, driving alone in the car, but it's still all about communication and working together, which in a way we also do when we're driving. So yeah, it was a good morning out on the water. Yeah. It looked great. It was really nice to experience all that. No, luckily not. It was good. That's probably still from Sunday night! I didn't know. I mean, it was probably a good one. We knew that coming into the weekend, it was probably not going to be our strongest weekend on the calendar. But I think we still managed well. Qualifying was very close. But Monaco is always quite chaotic and hectic in Qualifying. But then in the race, I think we had to do of course, that very long stint on the Medium, which wasn't planned, but we had to, so we just had to stay out there and wait for what Fernando behind me would do. And then, of course, the rain started to come down, it was all very chaotic, and it's not the nicest thing to happen to you when you're in the lead, and it starts raining. You don't want to take too much risk, but you don't want to lose too much time, but yeah, overall, it was a good race but also once I crossed the line, I was like, ‘I'm happy the weekend is over’. It's very hectic and quite stressful. So I'm also looking forward to this weekend. It’s a proper race track and this is where a Formula 1 car comes alive. I think Helmut got a bit excited as well. So I don't know. I mean, we’ll just do our normal programme and nothing crazy. It should do. Normally, yes, but we still need to find a good balance, but I think as long as we have a good balance in the car we can have a good weekend. Yeah, I mean, I just want to keep on doing what I'm doing. But of course, I need to have a good car for that. But I don't know how long that will last. But hopefully for a while. I constantly want to try and improve myself every single year. Sometimes, of course, that works out a bit better than other races. But I think I've said it many times, my goal was to win a championship and I did that. Now it's about just enjoying the moment you're in. Of course, I try to win as many races as I can, but I've never really been someone who was trying to break records or whatever. It's also important to have a good time. And hopefully, you know, work with the people I'm working with for a very long time as well. No, I think it's mainly just the team, of course, they want to score more points. But that's Monaco, you know, it can bite you. I've been in that position myself. But from my point of view, it doesn't really change anything. I know that it's a very long championship. You need to be very consistent. You can barely afford mistakes, especially when it's only one team, one opponent, really, because at the moment looks like best case you win, worst case you’re second, so you can't really lose too many points like that. But yeah, from my side, just keep grinding every single weekend. I mean, it's pretty similar, it doesn't really change anything for me. It's not like I came out of Monaco, relieved or whatever. I'm planning to gain seven points every single weekend, so… Yeah, well, that weekend itself was crazy. I mean, in the week leading up to it, I was in the simulator getting used to all the procedures because, OK, Red Bull might have two teams, but the cars at the time, they were very, very different to drive but also the whole steering wheel was different. So for me to go through all that and then already just sitting in the car, I drove out of the pits, there was so much more rake in the car, I could almost see my own front wing. So yeah, it was a big learning process throughout that whole weekend. And the funny thing was, I think Christian, before I jumped in the car before the race, he said: ‘Well, try to score some good points and have fun’. I definitely had some fun out there and it was really nice to win that race at the time. Of course, after that a lot of things have happened, a lot of positive things. And yeah, to have won the races I've won and, yeah, being on number 39… It's amazing, but it's also a bit like, well, we want to win more. So, it's not like we had a massive celebration, you know, we are in a very busy season and we want to win both championships again as a team. So we just keep on working. And honestly, I also really don't need that recognition. They know that I always give my 100%. And I know that it's also from their side, and I just really enjoy being part of the team and we just keep on working. No. I know Seb loves his statistics and numbers but again it's… he still has four titles compared to mine. I’m on two. So I think he's alright. Well, how it looks like at the moment, I think we can, but that's very unlikely to happen. You know, there are always things that go wrong, or you have, you know, a retirement or whatever. But, like purely on pace, I think at the moment, it looks like that. But we will always get to tracks maybe where it doesn't work out exactly, or whatever, bad luck in Qualifying, you make your own mistakes. And about the dominance? I mean, we've always seen this in Formula 1, it’s nothing new. So I think the longer you leave the regulations the same, the closer people will get. So maybe this is something we need to look at. But I don't remember really… I mean, you know, you have the odd year, or maybe two years where there are two teams fighting, maybe potentially a third team, but overall, when you look back at the ‘80s, the ‘90s, the 2000s and the early 2010s, you know, all the way to 2020, you know, it's been pure dominance of certain teams. I’ll say what I said before, just keep the regulations the same for a longer period of time. Because if you keep on tweaking stuff, people always find something or one particular team will always find something a bit better than the others and then it takes a bit of time for everyone to close up, from my side.
GR: I mean, from a technical standpoint, I have no view or idea how that could be achieved. And obviously, we've only been a couple of years now into the aero regulation and the handicap system, but it hasn't drastically changed anything up and down the order. Maybe the only team you can argue is Aston Martin, but I think that's probably via, you know, certain engineers joining to help push in the right direction. And, you know, you could give quadruple the amount of wind tunnel time to the team at the bottom over the one at the top and the the one at the top would probably still come out in the lead. Baku, Azerbaijan… I cannot name one particular person because there's so many people involved that spend so many hours and days and, you know, they worked hard. I mean, we had tough years where you know, you keep on hoping that you're closing the gap to try and win a championship and then yet another year where it was not working out. But we just kept on believing, kept on trying to put everyone in the right place to work to their best. And yeah, too many people to name because if I will name one person, I'm not giving enough credit to someone else, because at the end of the day it's a whole team effort that has to come together, you know, to achieve what we're doing now. No, I like watching it. How old is he now, 82? He’ll have to wait until he's 89 or 90 maybe? I don't know. No, I respect them a lot. I have some friends of mine doing it, but not at the moment no.",Spain,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean, I was just talking to Esteban about it, because we didn't pit from the Hard onto the Medium we were effectively in P3 and then made a bit of a mistake on the out lap, even under the yellow flag I wasn't even pushing but that's just how challenging the conditions were out there for everybody. And yeah, shame to miss those two extra positions to not be on the podium, but Esteban deserved it that weekend, so we would have been overstretching had we achieved it. Nevertheless, it’s history now, and looking forward to this weekend. I think there's a big variety from Saturday to Sunday performance. I think when you look on Saturday performance, we're certainly behind Ferrari and Aston Martin when you look, and sometimes, you know, the Alpine as well. When you look into the Sunday performance, we're probably a little bit closer to Aston Martin. But this weekend will be a good test. We'd like to think we can jump ahead of Ferrari globally, close that gap to Fernando, as he is definitely pretty fast, and try to close the gap to Red Bull and get P2 in the Constructors’. Yeah, I mean, as everybody else is saying, you can't really judge anything in Monaco. But there were certainly no nasty surprises. And considering how much we changed, I guess that was a positive in itself. But this will be a true test. I mean, we didn't learn anything from Monaco with regards to the new updates. So yeah, this will be where we take a new baseline and build from there. Yeah, I think so. I think we've made a lot of changes since the Bahrain test. We learned pretty quickly into the season that the car wasn't where we wanted it to be. So this, as I said, should be the new baseline. And we can we can go from here. I think the first time you realise is when you look at the lap times. You drive around the track, the car can sometimes feel great, but the lap times aren't representing the feeling and vice versa. I'm sure there's, even for championship-winning cars, they may not also feel perfect. We're just driving around at a slightly higher pace. So I think it was when we saw that the lap times weren't translating into what we expected. Aston Martin clearly made a big jump. And we hadn't made the jump that we were expecting and needed to make changes quick. So it was literally straight after the very first test in Bahrain. We were already planning towards the changes that are being implemented, last week in Monaco and obviously this weekend. Yeah, I think like Max said, on pure pace, for sure, they've got the potential, but certain things can happen. And I'd like to think we'll be able to fight at some point and take advantage of some misfortune, down the order. But yes, it's challenging. I agree with what Max said. There has always been dominance in Formula 1 . And I don't know how we get to a place where you can have multiple drivers and teams fighting for the championship, because I think that would be the best for the sport, best for all of us. And I think the fans would love it. But obviously, you can't always get what you dream for. I’m excited for this weekend. It's definitely a challenging start to the season. I don't think a lot of people you know appreciate going from Saudi to Miami to Melbourne. You know, Jeddah, they are all very… I said, Saudi and Jeddah, didn’t I? What else am I missing? Baku! Baku, Monaco. Yeah, Monaco, Monte Carlo! It's a really challenging start to the season. And I think now these next five races or so you'll get a better picture of where the car truly is. And the order will be in a bit more of a settled position. But, you know, we're not going to judge everything based on this weekend. We know last year we had a really competitive weekend in Barcelona, I think I was on the podium, Lewis was really strong in the race after a puncture, and we came away thinking, you know, all of our problems are solved. And we got to the following couple of races and learned that wasn't the case. So you know, that's Formula 1. I'm sure we'll probably have a slightly more competitive weekend here in Barcelona, but that doesn't mean that we’re necessarily back. Yeah, it’s definitely a huge step in terms of speed. But I think the biggest shock for me in getting to Formula 1 was on the technical front, you are dealing so much with all of the data in front of you, understanding the tyres, the tyre prep, you know, the bulk temperature, surface temperature, all of those things that you had no idea about in Formula 2, because the information just purely wasn't there. So, mixed feelings about the lack of data in F2, whether that's a good thing or not. But I think I would like to see those guys get the chance to have some of the sensors that we have in Formula 1 because we know in Formula 1 a driver could be half a second lap quicker, purely by getting the tyres in the right window or not, and in Formula 2, with such limited track time, you're, I wouldn’t say you were necessarily guessing, but you don't really have that chance to learn and know exactly what's needed for each situation. So that’s certainly difficult for F2 drivers.",Spain,thursday,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Pretty good, pretty special, as you can imagine. It feels great to be back home. Also, a circuit where in the past it has treated me really well. I think it’s my ninth year here and I think, yeah, a lot of good memories. Even from when I was a kid, you know, when I was 10 years old, and I came here for the first time to meet Fernando. I met Michael [Schumacher]. I saw Ferrari for the first time and 18 years later to be actually driving here as a Ferrari driver, you know, with the option of at least trying to get up a podium or a win, it's something really, really special that I try to think about it and just feel good about it. I think it's impossible to quantify the lap time. But I do know that it puts me, like, in a better vibe this weekend. Like, I am just in a better mood when I race at home. I do things with more interest. I do things with a bit more energy. I always try to put a smile with the fans, because you just know that they're cheering for you and they're giving you that extra bit of push. How much that is worth is impossible to know. But I do know that actually, Spain is the circuit where I've scored most points in my career – together with Monaco and Austin I think it’s up there – so it must do something good to me. We have an upgrade. How good, time will tell, but we have an upgrade coming. It's a bit of a new direction, a bit into what we believe should be the right path, into developing this car and making it a bit more of a driveable car, more consistent, better in the race, that we know is our main weakness. You've seen it hasn't been an easy start to the season and we've been struggling but it is true that with this first step into this direction we try and correct the deficiencies we have. But we also know that this upgrade is not going to change our life from one race to another. It’s still the first step of many steps to come. You did! Yeah, I think it's also the power of the brain, no, whatever motivates you in life, whatever makes you happy in life. If you do it with the power and you put… all invest everything into it like he's doing, you can be successful at an age that I believe is still reasonable. Yeah, I have a very good example also at home with my dad, 61 years old and going in Dakar in that car every year, risking his life, and you can just tell, he just loves it. He wants it. He puts all the effort, time and passion into it. And if that's the thing you like, normally the age comes into a second plane, no, and it's just all about how much you want it and of course, if you have the reflexes and the talent left, that takes care of itself. Yeah, I've heard of the project and everything. I just can say that I will do my maximum and just to ensure that there's still a Spanish Grand Prix, independently of where. I think Barcelona now is doing a great job and I've been enjoying coming to Barcelona many years. Obviously, I still need to go a bit more into the detail of what's going on in Madrid and what they're planning to do there but I will just support the Spanish Grand Prix independently of where it is and I will just help and offer my help for whatever they need, doesn’t matter if it's track design, or whatever and support it. I'm answering first to your second question: I would say that department is in constant progress and we're doing, I think, a lot of progress. It just hasn't been an easy year for us. When you spend the whole year starting further up on the grid from where you are actually… [where] your normal race pace is, which is normally… Our race pace this year has been a bit worse than our qualifying pace, then there's always going to be doubts and criticism about our race execution , because you're always kind of, because of the pace of the car, going a bit backwards, and I think that makes this first six races a bit more difficult to assess and judge. I do feel the team is doing everything they can and we can to be as strong as possible on that department but I… like always in everything in every aspect there's margin of improvement and we're doing it. Answering to the first bit, Monaco. I think it's a fair assessment. I think I was honestly quite a vocal about wanting to go and get that podium and maybe risking on staying on the hard but I also fully understand the team perspective that we are fighting the team championship with Mercedes. There's Lewis behind that just a very quick out lap on the Hards and we have to protect from him and we have to go at a position which at that space in time when I left the pits behind Esteban, I was quite frustrated about but then once they explain it to you and they explain the rationale and the reasons they do it, I perfectly understand it. It's just that I probably wasn't at the time in the same mindset and I was just focusing a lot more in extending the hard, trying maybe to catch the rain, trying to catch a safety car, trying to catch anything that would allow me to finish on that podium. And in the end, we will never know. Yeah, there's definitely, I think, F1, since Fernando arrived with the World Championships in 2005, has never stopped from being one of the most followed sports in the country. But I do feel like recent years for… doesn't matter if it's Netflix, me moving to Ferrari, Fernando being successful with Aston, there's another bit of a boom, and we need to maximise it and having this Grand Prix sold out is amazing. And I think also, my grandstand, 3000 tickets sold in less than eight minutes once I sold them just shows the passion and the emotion that there is for this Grand Prix and for the sport. And I also see a lot more of a younger audience. Yesterday, I was in an event in Barcelona promoting the Grand Prix together with the circuit. They've done a fan forum in the middle of Barcelona and we were… pretty much all the audience was young. They were all between 15 to 30 years old and you can just tell how much passion, how much love there is for the sport. And it's something that I see also in other countries, but it's obviously nice to see in my own country too. I don't think it’s the intention of everyone, especially when you look at where they are going with the races and the new horizons they have in the States and everywhere so I don't believe two Grands Prix in Spain is feasible right now. But I do feel like yeah, out of the Europe circuits or places that F1 is wanting to stay and is wanting to make sure we keep a base in Europe like we've seen in recent years, I do think Spain is the right place to keep a yearly Grand Prix and I'm sure Spain is going to do everything they can do to keep it, and I think it’s the right move. No, I don't think it's impossible. I think there's a space in the podium in case the two Red Bulls are dominating. There’s still that one space that we're fighting every weekend with, both Charles and me with Fernando, Lance and the two Mercedes, it’s a constant fight. Yes, Aston has the upper hand and normally are the strongest package come race day, but that's why we are trying to upgrade our car and trying to become quicker. And also, there's been circuits where we've managed to bother a bit Red Bull in qualifying but I do think Red Bull are going to stay ahead for some more races before someone can really make them tumble a bit because they are on a very, very high level and good job to them because they've done a very strong car this season. I think it would be huge, especially one of us is on the top step. I think it would be even more no? If we finished P2, P3 or P3, P2 would be cool but I think even more that people will just go wild if either one of us is on the top step of that podium no? But yeah, independently even a podium for both, I would take it as a strong day for Spain in home soil, so yeah, that would already be really, really good. Not much really. I cannot complain about life really. I'm a Ferrari driver living the dream. Yes, it's been a tough start to the season and I'd much rather be fighting for poles and wins like we were last year rather than struggling like we are. But we still have a chance at a podium pretty much every weekend, which is not that bad. I think I cannot complain about it. We're bringing a package here. You cannot imagine the effort Maranello has been trying to bring this package forward. It was supposed to come a lot later in the season and the whole factory was just flat out these last few months because of the situation to try and bring it earlier. And when I go everyday back to Maranello, I see what's going on there and I wake up every morning and I realise that I'm a Ferrari driver, that I'm still having a chance for the podium and that life is good, then there's nothing really that can bother you. And yeah, it's a long season and also we'll see where everyone is in in a couple of races or in the future.",Spain,thursday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Err… yes! Apart from when I beat him in Quali here a few years ago. I did. I was very happy. No, a home race is always more special, and even being his team-mate it was always good to see how many fans there were here for him and so on. So, yeah, happy. Car? Or driver? More so than in the dry, yes. It’s the same car in the wet, I don't know why it would be any better in the wet and the dry but it was certainly a lot of fun. It's a difficult track in the rain, a lot of risks taken but it's always tough to say. Of course, there's some little things that maybe lead us to believe that it was bit better in the wet than in the dry. But I wouldn't say we were that impressive in the dry. We looked good on Friday, Saturday morning, and qualifying, we didn't look too impressive. But yeah, the rain on Sunday, things definitely came towards us a lot more and the pace was one of the best on track – but we definitely didn’t have one of the best cars. So, it’s a bit confusing, but at the same time, if we can have some rain or something to help us out, then I would definitely be looking forward to it. Just knowledge, expertise. He’s been at Red Bull for many, many years, he's seen a lot of success with the team. He's been with some of the best minds within Formula 1 and he's definitely part of that group. So yeah, brains and lap-time I guess is the two big things. He’s a big person, a big signing for us as a team, is a big person, a big signing for us as a team so, I think someone that a lot of people within McLaren will look up to, and respect and so on. Yeah, but a good step for us as a team to keep this drive forward, continuing to add performance and expertise to the whole team in our drive to improve, move up the grid. I would say a lot. Even more now than in the past. I guess I would never want to say that I have no belief, and I never have said it and probably won’t, but definitely since the last few changes, there have been a lot of good things coming from that, both in terms of mood, atmosphere, but at the same time, also performance and things to look forward to in the future. So not everything is purely direct in Formula 1, a lot of things take time, so I guess you have that part of it too, but definitely things have taken a step forward so I can easily confirm that and say it with confidence. But yeah, until we see it, that's the timely part. I hope so. It's tough to know now. It’s always almost double my age, so it's like another whole life for me. Just in Formula 1 it’s a long time. I want to believe it, I guess. I’m not looking that far ahead of my career. But he is unique and I think he's shown that himself so good inspiration for anyone who wants to believe in that. So ask me again in 20 years and we’ll see.",Spain,thursday,McLaren
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, absolutely, it’s really exciting times for us as a team. I think it’s a big upgrade from where we were before for many years. I think it’s just a big opportunity for us to grow as a team and become a stronger team.",Spain,thursday,Aston Martin
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, it’s nice! I’ve had a lot of fun with it, to be honest, on the street tracks, but happy to get getting back to the tracks I know. I think it just makes my life a little bit easier. Not much, but a little bit and yeah, I think as a team, it’s going to be a bit of a tricky weekend, probably but we’ll do our best to get the most out of it.",Spain,thursday,Williams
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I locked the rears and I couldn't get out of it. So it's just trying to control it with a bit of drifting. But luckily, the wall, in a way, stopped it from sliding even more. Yeah, it's super nice to win it. It is also super nice to win it, I think, in the way we did today, with the weather and everything, to stay calm and bring it home. And yeah, again, a lot of points for the team as well. So it's great. Yeah, it was quite hectic towards the end. But also, I think the whole race was all about like management. Because, Fernando starting on the Hard made me do a very long stint, probably almost double to what we would have liked, but because of the rain in the area, we couldn't really stop. I mean, if it would have been nice and sunny, I would have stopped, put the Hard tyre on, and you catch up and you wait until Fernando does his pitstop, but we couldn't do that because the risk of rain was around so I had to stay out. The tyres were graining, I had to go through that graining phase, which wasn't that easy. But then luckily it picked up a little bit but then of course, it started to rain. And with really worn tyres, to go through there was not really enjoyable. Clipped a few barriers, especially on my in-lap, I think. It was very, very difficult. But even on the Intermediates after that, it was still very slippery through the second sector. It was quite wet there. And yeah, the hard bit is that, you have a good lead, but of course, you don’t want to risk too much, but also you don’t want to drive too slow, because then you have no temperature in your tyres. So, just trying to find a bit the middle ground initially was a bit tough, but then after a few laps, I think I settled in and felt quite comfortable. I mean, I wasn't really shocked or anything, but because of the weather, I knew that my first stint could be a long one. If you have a good car for a while, you can break these kinds of numbers. But yeah, it's great. I mean, I would have never thought that I would be in this position in my career. When I grew up, I wanted to be a Formula 1 driver and winning these races is amazing. It's better than I could have ever imagined, for sure. Well, it was just that I had a big lead and I didn't want to risk trying to be the same pace or faster and then end up in the wall. You have to be a little bit more careful. It's just not take too much risk but at the same time, of course not drive too slowly. I think I had Lando in my gearbox as well so at one point, I was like, well, I do need to speed up a bit. But yeah, it's not a comfortable situation to be in, when it's like that to run here in the wet but luckily after five laps to  change a few things on the steering wheel as well to just give me a bit of a better balance and that definitely helped as well. I don't know, to be honest, where the next one can be but it can be next week, because we always need to be perfect to really get everything out of it. We know that in the race we are very strong. But like Fernando said, we cannot afford the DNFs  and stuff. And yeah, we need to just try and keep improving. I mean street circuits, I think, overall it's always a little bit more hectic, a bit more chaos around it. But yeah, it's difficult to say which track can be the next one. My engineer was asking me the same thing but it's more when you're on a rhythm, it's better to just stay in that. I think just one time out of 16 I clipped the barrier. But I thought I had a bit more margin and then I just I touched those… okay, I didn't have the margin. But yeah, it was fine. It's better to be in a rhythm and feel good than slowing down and then be a bit out of your zone, and then also your tyres get colder. It's not what you like, they were already quite cold, so which is better, I think to stay in that because I was not overdriving it or whatever, it was just in my own zone. … 500 starts, just mentioned it. The clock is ticking.",Monaco,post-race,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, it was difficult. Also, we opted to start on the Hard tyre. So we gave up a little bit the possibility into Turn 1, due to the short run. And we thought to play a long game with the strategy but Max drove super well on the Medium tyres to extend that first stint. So we didn't have any chance. Then at the end the rain, made things complicated out there. And it was not easy to drive around. Exactly, exactly. Not full power around the lap. Braking was extremely fragile into Turn 5, into Turn 10. So yeah, it was not easy and I was surprised that there was no Safety Cars, no incidents. So I think everyone was doing an amazing job today to keep the cars on track. I'm very happy. I think the race was not easy to execute. When the rain came, made things a little bit difficult for everybody. Especially when you are on a podium place, you don't want anything strange to happen, any choas. And yeah, I was expecting a lot of Safety Cars and things, which didn't come. I think everyone was behaving really well and controlling a very difficult car – between [Turns] Five and Eight especially. So yeah, I have been few times third this year; today second, so we only miss that one step. I don’t know. I heard this question in the TV pen as well. Which, I was surprised a little bit. I didn’t leave the race from the cockpit, as you probably saw on the outside. For me, it was very clear that the track on that lap we stop was completely dry, apart from Turn 7 and 8. So, how will put the Inters? It was completely dry, 99 per cent of the track. So, I stopped for dries. The weather forecast, it was small shower, and the small quantity of rain as well, what we had, as a team, and we had a lot of margin behind us, to put the dry tyres and, if necessary, the Inter tyres, so, you know, maybe it was extra safe, I don't know. But that minute and a half that it took to go through Turns 5, 6, 7 and 8 again, it changed completely, so the out-lap on the dry tyres, it was very wet when I go to those corners, but the lap that we stopped, it was completely dry. I think we didn't have a chance, to be honest. I think we were brave on the strategy: it’s not normal that you start on the first row of the grid and you choose the Hard tyre, trying to do the opposite of the leaders. And that shows the commitment from the team and how aggressive everyone was in Aston Martin, trying to get the win. We knew that it was some downside that the strategy we could have ended-up maybe P5, P6 or something like that, out of the podium. But this morning, we discussed it and we said we’ve had couple of podiums this year so we go for all or nothing, we start on the Hard tyre. And we didn't have the pace. That was the only problem we had in the race. I think the strategy was good. The Medium tyre was behaving surprisingly good in our opinion. We were hoping for more graining or bigger degradation and Max was able to drive 50 laps on an amazing pace, and that was the reason why he won the race. Not because the strategy: he was just faster than us. Let's see. I think in any other…  of the seasons that I remember, back in the 2000s or early 2010s, I will be leading the championship with the results that I got this year but now there is Red Bull and Max dominating every race and even with great results, you're just stepping behind them, every race. So I don't know. We didn't have the best car in 2010 and we arrived leading the championship in Abu Dhabi. We didn't have the best car in ’12 and we still fight for the championship until the last lap in Brazil. So the championship is long, we will not give up.  We will need weekends where Red Bull has some issues like Sergio had here with the DNF or zero points. And if Max has one or two of those, we will be a little bit closer in the championship. This is motorsport. Anything can happen. But on pure pace. I think we don't have the chance yet. But we will not give up for sure. Yeah, it will be but I don't think that I will not put any pressure on my team or myself into next week. We saw today on race pace… yesterday was very close in qualifying but today in the race, we saw Red Bull again, very dominant. So we have to accept that things into next weekend will be maybe as we saw in any other race this year, where Red Bull is untouchable. And we have to see in a normal circuit, what is the package of Mercedes and the upgrades that Ferrari will bring apparently to Barcelona as well. So we have to have the feet on the ground and as I said in Miami, it’s going to be a few weekends in the year that we will just be seventh and eighth and we have to accept that and some others that we will fight for podiums. So I will not get into Barcelona, thinking that I will win, and disappoint anyone. We have to have the feet on the ground. Nothing really. I will always take a picture and on position one at the end after the champagne. So yeah, I touch it a few times already this year, but I will love to receive the trophy from there. But yeah, I'm not getting obsessed with this to be honest. I will be happy fighting for the championship with all second places until the end of the year or fighting for the championship next year. This year is just a gift, what we are having every weekend is just a celebration on the team. We didn't expect this and this is just a build up into next year so hopefully good things are coming. As I said before, when it started raining into turn five, six, and seven, I was with the hard tyres and they were quite old with 50 laps and it was difficult to put temperature on those tyres and in that part of the circuit. So we thought about stopping and the decision was to stop for the mediums or the inters. I asked about the forecast;  they said there's gonna be a short shower, but we don't know the quantity but it shouldn't be not too heavy. And yeah, I said we go for the dries, we go for dries because turns five, six, seven it was a few drops of rain and the rest of the circuit was dry. And then it rains heavier. And then the inters was a better choice. It stopped raining or it only rains in those three corners for five minutes and then you’ve made the right choice. This is wet races in Formula 1. But we had huge margin behind to do two stops if needed, one for the dries and one extra for the inters and we thought it was the right thing. So it was a complex race to read, to execute and we are P2 so I know there were a lot of questions in the TV pen as well about treating the inters and try to win the race but honestly, this is a different race than what we saw in the team. And we are P2 so we are very happy, very happy with the race because the P1 was very fast today,  on any tyre, in any condition Max was always 15 or 20 seconds in front of us. So there was no chance to win today.",Monaco,post-race,Aston Martin
Esteban Ocon,"Esty Besty’s on the podium, baby! Yeah, I mean we've done it. It was superb weekend from everyone at the team. You know, from the first day, from the simulator to really all the practice sessions, we improved the car from beginning to end and yeah, we didn't make a wrong foot any time, even when we put the Inter tyres, it was the perfect lap to do so. And yeah, I'm just enjoying the moment now. It's been a while since I've been on the podium and I hope this is the first of many. I’ve touched the wall enough yesterday! I didn't have today. So yeah, it gives less of a heart attack to the team. It's been a while, feels good, I can tell you that! I'm speechless at the moment. I'm a little bit on my cloud still. You know, before the weekend, if you told us that we are going to be in the top 10, we would have been happy. It would have been a strong weekend. But we are not in the top 10, we are not in the top five, we are on the podium this weekend here in Monaco. And yeah, that shows really that never stopped believing. You know, we had a difficult start to the season but from the first session, I felt strong in the car, felt confident at the wheel. I was able to push, session after sessions, closer to the limit than I'm usually doing in Monaco. And, and yeah, I mean, that allowed me to do the lap I did yesterday, which is obviously 90 per cent of the job – normally – in Monaco. But it was not really the case today! Today has been a little bit of a harder race. We hold that podium for a while, we had it secure but you know, I got a touch from Carlos at one stage, got damage on the on the back of the car. And then the rain shuffled everything again, and we had to choose to take the Inters at the right time. And we did so. And from there on I was under a huge amount of pressure from Lewis. We seems to be always the two fighting together when the conditions are like that! So yeah, we know each other well in those conditions. And yeah, until the last lap, he was pushing flat-out. He was quicker in the wet section from Five to Eight, and I was quicker on the dry sections. But yeah, it's been an incredibly tough race to get under control but the reward is immense. So, I'm extremely pleased. Yeah, I have been. I think, as soon as we put it down from the simulator days, really to all the practice sessions, we've been improving step-by-step and never stopping doing it. And it's been a very different weekend compared to my usual Monaco weekends, where I was not afraid to go close to the walls very early. And that's what we've done. And yeah, extremely surprised us for sure. I think we should keep feet to the ground at the moment. Obviously, we're on the podium here, we will enjoy all together. And yeah, I want to thank all the team, obviously Enstone, Viry, the team on-site here. That podium, not win, not yet! That podium is all for them. But yeah, Barcelona is going to be a very different characteristic. A track that everyone knows and a good test for us to see where we are exactly. Why everyone's delighted, that's for sure. Formula 1 is unpredictable. You don't know what's going to happen and at the moment how tight the field is, a little bit more pace can change your weekend completely. And, and yeah, this weekend, it's been an awesome one, an awesome preparation and yeah, as I keep saying, we keep pushing, we don't stop believing and hopefully that's the first podium of many. Yeah, that's true, actually. Forgot the question… We will see next week. I think it's a very different track in terms of characteristic here but clearly the car fell more alive and I had a lot more confidence in it to start the weekend. So we did bring some updates that were supposed to be quite small but everything we had it goes in the right direction today. Yeah, it definitely felt good and I hope that this is the start of something, but I think we need to keep our feet to the ground, see where we are next weekend.  It’s going to be a good test. And then yeah, we'll see.  And about the next part of the question, I think, big respect to Aston Martin for what they are doing. I think they've shown really the way that this is possible, to go from the midfield to be a top team and we should all take example of that.",Monaco,post-race,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"I'm not satisfied with P3, but on the other hand we need to look at the situation we are in with the car. It was a very tricky Qualifying, a bad weekend for me, especially I struggle a lot with the car. We struggle a lot on bumps compared to the other cars, but in Qualifying the car was a bit more alive, I was a bit more at ease with the car and we managed to do P3, very close to the pole position. So all in all, you know, happy, but I would have preferred to be first of course. I guess a little bit more luck than the other years, but apart from that, I don't know how is the forecast. Yesterday it looked like maybe we'll have some rain. So if it's the case then everything is possible and I'll go for it anyway and let's see where we end up. Disappointed with third but at the same time, I think I need to look at the weekend as a whole. I've been struggling with the car like crazy. We've had a lot of problems with bottoming, especially over the hill to Turn 3 and Turn 13 also. In Qualifying, it was the same but with the new tyres, you can extract a bit more and I managed to put everything I wanted in one lap. Wasn't enough for the pole, but anyway, I think that was the maximum we could do today. No, I don't think so. Because even looking back at the lap in Q3, honestly, the lap was really good. So yeah, I don't think there was much more. Well, I mean, as Fernando said, it’s not the track where you can overtake and even if we could overtake, I think that in terms of race pace, we are a little bit behind. But let's see, I mean the forecast, I haven't seen the forecast recently, last time I checked it, there was some rain around. So, if this is the case, then there will be a little bit of luck into play too. And hopefully we can take the right choices and make up some positions. No, no, no, I'm not that desperate. If it’s dry, Monaco is also nice with dry. I mean, the last few years the rain didn't really play in my favour. So, if it can be a dry race, and we can stay on the podium, that will be already a good weekend considering the difficulties we've had. I think our last lap, we were speaking with Fernando, and we go into Turn 3, 4, 13 especially, and you’re just like ‘OK, let’s see what happens!’ You release the brakes and you don't see anything because the car is moving like crazy with the bumps. I really struggled with that, the whole weekend, and yeah, in Q3, you just go for it and see what happens. So, it was a good feeling. Whether it was my best lap around Monaco, I don't think so. I think last year was a pretty good qualifying, but I was also more at ease with the car. But it's always exciting in Monaco, and it always feels amazing. Then our chances for the win, again, as I said, I think it's going to be difficult if it's a normal race. Yeah, exactly. Nothing to add.  It's just such an exciting day, then race day, yes, it is not the most exciting race in terms of overtaking but the Saturday is just incredible. The feeling that we have over the Quali lap is so good and yeah, it's like nowhere else on the calendar. So yeah, it feels really good. I think it's on bumps especially. If we look at the on-boards of the different cars, check my head and it's crazy. It's going from left to right, especially on top of the hill, Turn 3 and Turn 13. It's very, very tricky. Last year, it was much better and much easier to see the road. So the car will absorb much more the bumps and that was much easier to be consistent. So yeah, that is the biggest difference.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, very happy. I mean, we knew that this was going to be a little bit of a struggle for us this weekend to get everything together. Yesterday it wasn't the best start but I think we kept on improving and kept on being better. But then in Qualifying you need to go all out and risk it all. My first sector wasn't ideal in my final lap – I think Turn 1 was a bit cautious – but then I knew that I was behind, so in the last sector I just gave it everything I had. I clipped a few barriers, but of course very happy to be on pole here for the first time. Yeah, we need a clean start. I mean, it's a short run to Turn 1 and you know in Monaco a lot of things can happen, right? Safety car, rain, you name it. There’s always a bit of chaos involved but I think race pace-wise here the car is quick, so that is not the problem but we just need to keep it clean and calm. No, I don't think so, but it was good enough. And I'm just happy to get my first pole here. You know, it's always super hectic. And finally, you know, we also had just clean running in Q3 as well, so that was nice for everyone to just push to the limit. And yeah, I mean, the whole qualifying went pretty well. I struggled a bit to put it in the first lap, with warm-up, with the tyres, and just putting it all together, all the sectors. But I knew that the last lap I had to do it, because they improved. And I also knew going into the last sector I was down on them. So I had to push flat out in the last sector, risk everything to get back the lap time. And luckily, we did. Touched a few walls! Guard rails and walls. And yeah, I mean, I was always quite quick in the last sector but yeah, I definitely pushed a bit harder on the last lap. I mean, the race should be OK. It's just about having a clean start. I mean, there's always chaos involved in Monaco. But I think our race pace, in general the behaviour of the car on the tyres is fine. But it was all about just putting that together over one lap, which I knew was going to be a little bit harder for us here in Monaco, just with how our car is, the characteristics of it. But still to be first here is great for the whole team. Not really, I mean, I knew that going into this weekend it was going to be tight around here. And yeah, it has proven that in Qualifying. I mean, I like to see Fernando win but I also like to see myself win. It's a tough one. I'll think about it! No, it was just how I thought we would have the best chance of putting it on pole. You know, every car reacts a little bit differently with how the tyres warm up over a lap, and for us that was the right choice to do it like that. I think my out-lap wasn't ideal. I had to drive a little bit slower than I would have liked because unfortunately, there were a few cars in front of me who I think aborted maybe and then went again. So, it definitely wasn't an ideal start to the lap. So maybe that's why my Sector One was a little bit down and then it all started to come up. Because it's all about confidence as well around here. When you don't feel like the tyres are fully ready, you don't hit the brakes as hard into Turn One and everything is a little bit compromised. A lot of things come into play, you know, to have a perfect lap here. If it ends up in a good result, I'm happy, otherwise I don't care! Nah, it’s of course, a lot of adrenaline. I can feel that every time you jump in the car, you know, your heart rate probably is a bit higher than on other tracks when you do a qualifying lap. Because you know that when you make one tiny misjudgement or whatever, you end up in the wall. And yeah, definitely from all the street circuits we do, this one over a Quali lap, definitely the hardest, I think, to nail and you feel it when you jump out of the car. You're full of adrenaline and your heart rate is still higher than other Qualifyings. No, for me it's nothing of a surprise. I grew up watching Fernando in F1 and I liked his style and for him to still be here at 41 it's very impressive and I think it's a great example for people out there, if you stay committed and believe in yourself, believe in the opportunities that come to you, then you can show something like he's doing right now. But, of course, you need also a lot of natural raw talent with that. Smelling good? I have some plants at home as well.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, I feel good. Obviously pole position means a lot here in Monaco but you know today Max was a little bit faster, which is a shame, but I think first row on the grid for us is quite a big thing here. As you said, the last sector seems to be our weakest point of the circuit. Let's see tomorrow, what we can do in terms of a strategy, if there is any weather coming or something, but we will try to win. I mean, it's very short into Turn 1, but yeah, we have normally a good starts this year. Max is a little inconsistent, so maybe it's one of those bad ones tomorrow. Yeah, you never know here in Monaco. As Max said now, you know, anything can happen. There are always couple of incidents, yellows, you know, red flags. So it's better to put a lap on the board and just be at the front. So when they told me that we were P1, just Tsunoda and Max completing the laps, I knew that the possibility was there to be P2. But yeah, I think even if it feels very close, the proposition, we have to be happy. I think we came here with some concerns about our performance on Saturdays. We seem very good on Sundays and taking care of the tyres – degradation is very good on our car. But we struggle a little bit on the street circuits to put the temperature and to hit the lap in Q3. And we're starting in the first row of the grid in Monaco, so I think it’s job done today. I don't think so. I think both laps in Q3, we were increasing the level of risk into uncomfortable level, let's say. And I think both laps in Q3 were… yeah…  a little bit over the limit sometimes but everything went fine. Last sector seems our weakest part of the circuit. Already in FP3, we were I think eighth quickest team in the last sector, so there is something going on there that we need to analyse a little bit, maybe going into Singapore or wherever is then the next opportunity we have. Great, looking at that! Let’s see. I think it's a long race. I don't think that overtaking opportunities will come at all, as it is Monaco, but this is a very demanding race: on the car; on the gearbox; on the brakes. You know, there are a lot of things that you need to take care of over 78 laps. So, we have to be focused, very concentrated, we have to be sharp on the strategy, pit stops. You know, anything can happen. If an opportunity comes, we will take it. Yeah, difficult to compare. I mean, all the qualifying here in Monaco, they are quite exciting. Adrenaline is very high around the lap. Maybe with these cars, they decide to be extra because visibility is very compromised with the front wheels and the wheel arch on top of the wheels. There are a couple of corners that we cannot see us as we were able to do in the past. So, Turn, maybe 8? The last corner, 19, is just a guess, because there is no way you can see the barrier. So that's adding a little bit of stress, for sure, in the lap. But yeah, I was happy. One of the best laps for me in Monaco, for sure. And the chances to win tomorrow, as I said before, I think we need the help from Max, but we cannot… I mean, take it for granted that all three cars will finish the race with no issues. This is Monaco and it’s going to be demanding. Yeah, similar. I think the lap is high adrenaline and I think if we see also how it looks on TV, when I was sitting in the car, you see the whole Monaco today on a sunny day, I think is a very unique place. Even last year when there were talks that maybe Monaco was not on the calendar for the future it doesn't sound right. It has to be always. I think I risk enough today. So, tomorrow, as I said, we will try to finish the race to see the chequered flag, try to take the maximum points. If there is a normal Monaco race, we should be on the podium, more or less securing the positions that we see here in this moment. And, as I said, if there is an opportunity or mechanical failure from Max or a bad pit stop or lucky strategy or whatever, we will take it. But if not, there is not [anything] coming from our side that we risk more or less and then we will have a chance to win. There is no way you will overtake anyone, so it's just avoiding a mistake, which sounds a boring race on Sundays in Monaco and from the outside looks easy but it is still extremely difficult to keep the car in good shape and on those streets for 78 laps. It feels great. I always had self confidence in what I could do in terms of driving –  overconfidence sometimes – but that's part of my DNA probably, but it is a proof maybe for people outside. There were a lot of new fans maybe coming as well from 2014 or 15 or Drive To Survive or all these things, that they only saw me fighting for Q3s or something like that or retiring in the race with some smoke at the back. So, now I think they are surprised that they see me fighting a little bit towards the front. But for me it's just… it is OK and I'm enjoying but it is more enjoyable that people or new fans can see that we are fast. The start has been very good for us this year, it's true. And Max maybe has been a little bit inconsistent sometimes. When he’s good, it’s as good as we are and sometimes a little bit worse. The thing is that the distance to Turn 1 I think is too short, for whatever start performance you have, and it's too narrow, I think, to try. Let's see tomorrow how it goes but it is maybe not in my head at the moment, that it's that opportunity or nothing. I think it's, as I said, a long race that we will focus on it. And the rain? I think it will not help, to be honest. I prefer a dry race. We have a better chance to secure big points from a dry race and on a chaotic, rainy day it will only help the people out of position and I think we are in position at the moment. There are no flowers here. It was only Miami and… Yeah, you and Checo were talking a lot, so I have to wait in the TV pen for a long time and there were a couple of flowers and I love flowers. But yeah, yesterday the team is now putting some extra flowers in the motorhome, so I have some in my room as well. I can go in my free time. We talk tomorrow night - depends how aggressive you are in the race.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, so first of all, I think everyone was excited about the Imola Grand Prix, especially for our home Grand Prix. All the, you know, Faenza and Imola people were excited but at the same time we had a massive storm overnight, well, I would say consistently for three days and most of the town where I live in Faenza was just completely flooded. Just mud everywhere, covered by mud, 70%, or more than that probably. And yeah, I mean, I was just staying safe in the night when the rain was coming but I was also worried because consistently also the electricity got shut down in my house as well. So I was a bit worried, but luckily my house was OK. But at the same time, a day after when I went to town it was just completely mud everywhere. There was water was until two or three metres. Ground floor properties were already covered by mud and water. So it's really been a huge impact on us and yeah, it was really terrible, terrible nights. No. I saw it only maybe on TV and never expected the things like that, that horrible things will actually happen in front of me. But suddenly it happened in front of me, just this completely different feeling to what I was watching TV, just so scared. You know, just consistently having to worry about, like, the ground floor. Luckily, I have the second floor so I was staying on the second floor all the time. Yeah, just really… because helicopters were also flying around and I could tell that, you know, they were already starting to, you know, help the people from the houses, you know, already got (inaudible) that just consistently knowing it was happening around. Just yeah, it's very scary. Yeah, I think the upgrades we were planning for Imola will automatically come to this Monaco. To be honest, I think It's hard to feel a difference, because it's not like the same place in [terms of the] downforce required, it’s more towards, like, mechanical grip, so maybe it's hard to see true performance, true gain, but still looking forward to it. And yeah, completely the bodywork changes, so, I haven't seen yet but I'm looking forward to seeing those things. Yeah, very excited. As a part of the Honda family, you know, it's good to see them back into the Formula 1 environment. You know, obviously, it was actually a shame you know, two years, three years ago, when they retired after they had such a massive year with Red Bull. So, I would say it's good for them. They like their challenges. And I hope they have another successful season with Aston Martin. Well, I don't know for now, to be honest. It's still far away to think about. But yeah, interesting two teams, two manufacturers in a collaboration with each other. I heard it's not their first time so maybe they can adapt quickly. But yeah, I mean, it's good to see of course. Yeah, I mean, as Scuderia AlphaTauri the future is guaranteed but not mine. But I think it's good for AlphaTauri, especially the engineers and mechanics, you know, they now can focus completely to the racing and definitely, you know, most of the mechanics and engineers, they're a little bit concerned about it. So it's good, definitely. And I think it's the right decision for Red Bull, because they had Toro Rosso, they have history, so, like suddenly you can’t just cancel those things, it’s a little bit different so it's good. And obviously for me, at least it’s one thing I don't have to be concerned about, so it's good. Yeah, first of all, it's a long time story. It’s still three years until 2026. So first of all, I don't feel much pressure from it. Because I have to prove a lot of things anyway until three years. But it's good at the same time he is saying the right things. That is good. You want to be at least, kind of, on the list, which means until then you’re proving your skills, everything. Yeah, he's right, but same time, obviously also Red Bull are supporting me for a long time, a lot of years and I’m part of Red Bull, so obviously we’ll have to see the situation then and how we feel and how with Red Bull as well but… yeah, we’ll have to see. And obviously, always as a driver it’s good to be on a list at any team, have a bit of tension, so we’ll see then. Also, pretty much similar comments as Sergio. The first time I went Honda's factory in Sukura in the last year, how they operate in the factory is just phenomenal. It’s, like really crazy, super detailed. I chatted with everyone, they're really professional, so I think Honda came in five, ten years ago, whatever, and they progressed massively quickly, and now they’re fighting for first and the Championship. So yeah, it's good and also I guess for Aston as well. They are progressing a lot, so those two combined with each other will be definitely threat for competitors. So yeah, interesting matching, and I think, excited to see how they go.",Monaco,thursday,RB
Fernando Alonso,"Hello. Yeah, I mean, very good news for the team, very exciting. I think, you know, it shows the commitment of Aston Martin to really win races, win championships in the future, being independent, manufacturing their own gearboxes and everything on the car. And, yeah, it’s the only way probably, to really be 100% sure that you are in control of everything in your package, in your car. And it's a great sign for everybody in Aston Martin, you know the desire and the potential to win is there. No. I think so, I think so. Especially in 2026, where, you know, the new regulations will come. It is always better if you can develop your power unit, together with the chassis and have everything integrated well in advance, being a works team, I think there are only benefits. I think that doesn't mean that until 2026 Aston Martin will not have a chance to win the championship. I think the same as any other race, to be honest. I think we are not thinking that we are the strongest in Monaco. I don't think that this is going to be a huge change compared to Baku, which is still a street circuit. Miami… I think Ferrari was outstanding in Baku and we could see another great weekend for them here. But then, you know if I tell you that I don't come here thinking that I can win the race, I will lie to you, because this is a one-off opportunity. We know that Monaco, Singapore, there are specific race tracks that you need to gain the confidence on the free practice, get closer and closer to the walls, and yeah, I will attack more than any other weekend, yes. I don’t care. I did crash. Yes. Forty-four. I will be 44. I don't know. It’s way too far ahead to really have an idea. So, yeah, I have to concentrate and focus on this year. As I said, this is very exciting news, what is happening now to the team, this new partnership with Honda, the new factory. At the end of this month, I think the team is moving to the new building; the new wind tunnel next year. So, there are so many things happening that it is just normal to get excited and want to be part of this team for many, many years. It it's a driver or in a different role, I will be just honoured to be part of it. But so far it’s just Monaco in my head, and this year and next year, so even ’25 I'm not sure what I will do. A lot! Yeah, I do enjoy a lot. I think the Ferrari time was quite good as well. 2010, ’12 I think we have seven different winners in the first seven races in 2012 and it was quite fun back then. And yeah, outside Formula 1 I had a great time in WEC and in Indy as well. But now it is just phenomenal what this team has done in the last winter, the car is so enjoyable to drive. So easy to drive. So, so fast. And the whole team is a high-class team. Today, for example is the first time that I went to the motorhome because we skipped Imola. So just to in this motorhome, and the room that I have, everything is just mind blowing. I have everything you know? I'm thinking to stay here overnight. I have no idea. But he always said that he wins and he loses together with the team, so if he’s not winning, he should stay. You'll never know. I think they are better than everyone else. They did a better job and they are dominating the season, and they deserve it. So, for us, it's just a gift, what we are achieving at the moment. We didn't expect to in this position so we are enjoying every weekend. But yeah, you know, there are a couple of weekends like this one that I come here thinking that I will try to win. And maybe it’s our worst weekend and we are out of the points! You never know. This is a very specific circuit. But, you know, there is this kind of one-off opportunities that you try to maximise. We saw gearbox failure for Max in Saudi, in Q2, we had problems in Checo’s car in Australia, all the free practice and Qualifying. So if one of those things happens on Sunday, automatically, you close the gap massively and it starts to be more interesting. So, Championship is long, we will not give up.",Monaco,thursday,Aston Martin
Kevin Magnussen,"Yeah, absolutely, time flies. When I think about it, it doesn't seem like that many races and that much time. But it's been a lot of fun. And you know, Haas has been my home in Formula 1. It's the first team that I fully established myself with. I had one season with McLaren and one season with Renault, but you know, very much Haas became my home in Formula 1 and I’m having a great time. It's changed a lot. I mean, basically, the set-up and the structure in the team is the same, with Dallara and Ferrari. But there's been huge growth and change within the team, the staff and just the structure of the personnel, how it's all structured between who works at Ferrari who works at Dallara, and in England, and in the US there's been a lot of change. But I think, you know, Haas is a team that came into Formula 1 as a real new team, you know. They didn't buy an entity. They didn't go in and buy a factory and all those things. It was set up completely from scratch. And I think in a very interesting way, a different way to all the other teams and it's been a big success, I would say, what Gene and Guenther have done. Yeah, for sure, I mean the only time we got P1 was in qualifying in Brazil last year. And you know, what we are all here to do and what we are all doing about this is getting the best out of it and finishing in front. And certainly pole position is not what I dreamt about as a kid, that wasn't like the end goal, but for sure so far it was a very big surprise, you know. To get pole position in a Haas is not something that I think anyone could expect and that was certainly a highlight. I think we've been pretty, not consistent in terms of results, but at least in terms of performance. I feel like we've had a pretty good package for all these different tracks we've been to this year. And, you know, that gives some confidence that this track could be OK as well. I don't think our car has any specific weaknesses or specific strengths. I think it’s pretty overall… You know, we’re in the mix in the top 10. We saw in Miami it was a race where everyone finished. There was not even a yellow flag in the race. And, you know, we finished 10th. With everyone finishing and no, sort of, strategic advantage, or like a safety car or anything like that, we were in the top 10 still. So I think you know, that's where we aim to be every race, trying to get into the top 10 and score points.",Monaco,thursday,Haas
Sergio Pérez,"We certainly know that it’s not our strongest circuit, no? We will struggle a bit to show our strengths, but it's still Monaco and I think, come Saturday, you really need a good warm-up on your tyres, that definitely is a key around here. And yeah, let's say it's not our strongest circuit, but we will see. It's still Monaco and anything can happen. Certainly. I think Fernando, the Ferraris, I do expect them to be quite strong as well, like they were in Baku. Obviously over one lap around this place they will be strong. So yeah, I do expect them to be quite strong. And also Mercedes can be in the mix. Yeah, probably Monaco, it's one of those that it's a full street circuit, wherever you are in the circuit normally, if you make a mistake, you will end up in the wall. There is no margin for error. Sunday can be quite boring for the fans, but not for the driver. Because at any point, you can make a mistake and finish your race. And I think we all enjoy too much Saturday, when we go to qualify and we know that it's everything that counts. Yeah, it’s certainly important, you know. I don't want him to start building that gap on points. So obviously, every weekend it's a new opportunity to reduce the distance. Well, I've won already two races. So certainly, I think it's all open, we have full support from our team. And as long as I'm able to deliver the results on track, weekend by weekend, I do expect to have full support from my team. Well, to me has been really privileged to work with Honda. It's been really impressive to see that, every time you ask for something, things were happening or at least were changing. They were listening very carefully to the feedback of the driver, even through the weekend, how we can tune the engine throughout the shifts, and all of that sort of stuff. To me, that has been really impressive. And I think Aston is a top team that is getting a top manufacturer. So, I think the combination itself is going to be one of the most powerful for 2026. Well, we are obviously excited to have Ford at the time, but we don't know what to expect: I've never worked with them. So it's going to be a new challenge. But certainly, from what I've seen so far from Honda, I've been really impressed with: with their work ethic and the amount of detail they put into every single thing that you ask for. As a driver, it has been really impressive for me.",Monaco,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I think going into the weekend, we had a feeling that some of the corners might not suit us very well and it turned out to be the case. In the race, for both myself and Lando, we both had some issues. So I think it made it look even worse than it was. But yeah, in saying that, I think we've analysed that quite heavily and hopefully we can make some steps to improve in those kinds of conditions. I hope so. I think, also, it's supposed to be a lot colder than Miami was, which we think was part of our issue as well. So yeah, obviously a very different circuit here to Miami, so hopefully it suits us a bit better. But in saying that, we need to address our weaknesses in other areas too. Faster – that's for sure. I think the first time I went to Saudi this year was quite an eye-opener, how much quicker Sector 1 is in an F1 car. So I think everywhere around here will feel a lot quicker. But we've got three hours of practice, which is nice compared to the 45 minutes I used to have around here. So, it's a lot of time to get used to it. Obviously, you want to try and start on the front foot and build yourself up from a good starting point, but yeah, we've got time and obviously it could be mixed conditions as well, so I think depending on the session, it could be very different for everyone. Not particularly, to be honest, when I saw it was 240 something miles an hour into Turn 1. That's, yeah… If you get it wrong, it's going to hurt. Fernando, does it hurt? You didn't crash… You did crash! Does it hurt? OK, so there's your answer! Maybe after F1, but not anytime soon. I think firstly, just getting back up to speed after last year. Not driving anything last year. I think getting used to first laps and race starts again. And being around other cars is always a challenge. So I think that's been nice to get back into that rhythm. I think just, you know, understanding more about the world of F1 and how to structure your weekends properly and, and stuff like that. I think in terms of driving as well, obviously, I've got you know a very good benchmark in Lando. So I've been able to learn a lot about firstly, how to attack my driving but also how to help the team try and move forward as well. And I think we've been working together very well on that. So yeah, I've also had now a race with no BBW on the car, which was an experienced to say the least. But yeah, there's been a lot of learning and I'm sure it’ll only continue.",Monaco,thursday,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, as good as last year and the years before, it's always very special for me, because those are the streets where I've grown up. I know the city by heart, wherever I go on the track I've got some friends living right over the track and can see the race from their apartments. So, it's very, very special for me. I do not believe too much in luck, but it's true that when you see the records, it’s not always been easy on race day, but Saturday was good, which I hope we can reproduce a good performance this Saturday, with a better Sunday this time. I mean, honestly, I think Red Bull is still the team to beat. With a special lap, maybe we can beat them in Qualifying. In the race, they are extremely quick – but again on a track like this, overtaking is very difficult. So yeah. And not only Red Bull is quick: Aston Martin will be in the mix. Mercedes arrived with a very different-looking car, which I'm curious to see how it performs. And yeah, then we need to see where we are and what's possible. Hmmm… I mean, not really, in a way, because I still believe Red Bull is the fastest. Hello Lewis! I mean, a fast teammate, as everybody. We are in Formula 1, and we love to be fighting against the best.  But that's not to say that my teammate is not fast. Carlos is an extremely fast driver. But yeah, considering that, I mean, I'm not the person who makes the choices. So yeah, let's see. If I say yes, I imagine it being the title of every newspaper. But I mean, Lewis is such an incredible driver, has achieved so much in the sport. So, I think anybody on the grid will love to have Lewis as a teammate, as everybody will learn a lot from him. But yeah, again, I'm happy where I am. And with Carlos, it's a great relationship too. I think it happened again. I have the picture! But I did not know that it was you. And I think you didn't know that it was me – but we were fighting for the ball. Yeah, other than what Valtteri said, it's also a very different approach to a normal weekend. Whenever we get to this track it’s all about going step by step to the limit until qualifying when you go all out and that's such an incredible feeling. Just the excitement and the adrenaline that you get around this track is amazing. It reminds me a little bit of my karting days where you don't really have time to think because there are no straights, so it's corners after corners. And yeah, it's just really exciting and probably it’s the best qualifying of the year for sure. No, no talks has been started on my renewal for now. I speak with John regularly about the season and the vision for the future but not yet about my contract situation. There's still a year and a half before the end of my contract, so still a lot of time. Oh, okay. With my road car you mean? I don't think I tried it until I actually drove it with a Formula 2 car. So yeah, a year after.",Monaco,thursday,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Firstly, thank you for the nice words. Hi everybody. Yeah, I think naturally when you're in contract negotiations, there's always going to be speculation. And I think ultimately that's… unless you hear from me, then that's all it is. Well, there’s a certain individual in this room who’s written at least one of them! But yeah, I don't know. I think maybe with last weekend, with the race been cancelled, maybe they just got bored and started to…  ha!  But I think, as I said, my team’s working closely behind the scenes with Toto, we're almost at the end of having a contract ready. So, having a team focus on that, so I can just do my job, that's a much better position than I was in before, because I remember I used to do all my negotiations on my own, and it was very stressful. So, I don't have to do that anymore. Yes, I mean, through the whole factory. I was there last week, as we were preparing for the weekend and we got the news, which I think was the right decision, and all of us were really thinking of what was happening there in the region, Emilia-Romagna, and I think it was the right decision. But I'm grateful that we are here. The upgrades, will be difficult to see just how it works at this kind of track, but I'm hopeful that it puts us a little bit closer to these guys, so we can… I don't think we'll be fighting for a win, necessarily, but hopefully it'll be more than a fight. Firstly, no, it doesn't have a bearing, I think, because I don't feel like… we're still a championship-winning team. It's just we've had the wrong car. There have been some decisions that have been made over the past two years that have not been ideal and we're working our way through that. All the energy is going towards… We have a new upgrade this weekend, the team have worked incredibly hard to bring this upgrade. We already, after Bahrain, decided that that's what we're going to do, and so I was a little bit gutted when the last race got cancelled because I was excited to try this new package. And whilst here is not the best platform track-wise to really see those come to fruition we'll hopefully experience that more next week. And otherwise, as I said, my team are chatting, having the discussions with the team in the background and we're almost there so… No. Wasn't expecting that one! I don't know, it’s a much different…. I think Silverstone puts on a great race, but it's a much different race to what you’ll see at Vegas. I don't really know what to say. I think they put on an amazing show in the UK. The organisation is great there. We have a big, huge turnout of fans. I don't know how it relates to Vegas, though, if I'm really honest. It's not really stuff that I can really talk about, to be honest. But as I said, this is the first time I think that I've not been negotiating myself and I've got a great team in the background that are doing all the work so I can just focus fully on the job at hand. I say what I want and that's what we're working towards and so hopefully in the coming weeks. I got them in my pocket actually. I thought about it. No, I'm kidding. 100% yeah. As the sport continues to grow, there's more and more people coming onto the team. There's a lot of people on the team that have had all the success that we've had in the past. And there's a lot of people that haven't had that success yet and are super hungry. I'm really encouraged when I do go back to the factory and see just how hard everyone's working. Last year we were a little bit lost in terms of how to fix the issue that we had. I feel like the team now have a much… they have a north star, they know exactly where they need to go and we’re working on how to get there. But yeah, the amount of work has gone in is incredible and I'm very, very grateful for the hard work. I've been so excited to get in the car and feel these changes and I feel that hopefully puts us on the right path now to progress forward and try and catch the guys ahead. Not much more to add to it, but most often it's just sheer luck. You throw it into the corner and come out with your eyes open and hopefully you've made it round. So it's awesome, it's an amazing place to race and we're so privileged to be able to do what we do and being one of the only 20 to do it here at the peak of the sport. So epic. It’s tequila on the rocks! Oh, no. If you can provide me some I’ll try it. I've never had it before.",Monaco,thursday,Mercedes
Pierre Gasly,"Completely untrue! Not this year! This happened once, but not this year, we were all… OK, it may have happened. Let’s say our level is still to be improved. I was just giving him support! Most important, we won that game, that’s all that matters. Yeah, I did. It was a nice workout and no, honestly, the football was great. Great to team-up with Carlos and Charles, just ahead of the weekend, and taking it slightly easier. I think it's important for us to build up on Miami. We showed slightly better pace, I think, in the last race in scoring points with both cars. Ultimately we want to do better than what we've been showing since the start of the year and hopefully we can build up from there this weekend. Well, first we need to find consistency and then… I don't think we are miles behind Ferrari and Mercedes right in front of us, so definitely we’ve got some potential. We need to unlock a bit more from the package. We have got small bits coming there weekend after weekend and hopefully that can close the gap with these guys. I think we all share the same ambitions inside the team. We all want to see the team performing at the top and fighting for better positions than what we've been doing so far. I wouldn't say it's criticism but more the eagerness and the will and the desire to be right there at the top and everybody is trying their best. I trust the team in the progress they've been showing over the last couple of years and we've had a slightly slower start than what we would have liked and wanted. But now we just need to keep our head down and keep progressing weekend after weekend and just moving forward and find some more performance. You did your homework! Yeah, I did try the latest tyres we're going to have in Ricard, I think like 10 days ago. So I wouldn’t to say there is any concern, there's always work to try to develop the product that we got and I think there are certain areas of the tyres we would like to improve. I don't think it's massively different to what it was last year. So I just expect very similar behaviour to what we had to face and deal with last season. Personally, I don't think this had any impact on my performance or my approach to racing. Obviously, it wasn't an ideal situation to be in. And it’s always in the back of your mind, but I know I'm a respectful driver. I always fight at the limit, but it's not like I go purposely over the limit so I wasn't really concerned about it. But yeah, obviously great to know that I got these two extra points after last weekend and I won't have to think about it that much. Yeah, I completely agree with Valtteri and Charles and I will say it's a lot about precision at Monaco, it's all about being very precise with your lines, being millimetres away from the rails everywhere, really nailing the braking points and you have this risk which brings more adrenaline to it. You’ll seem when you go for one push lap in qualifying three, and you need to make it work, there's pressure and butterflies you create inside the stomach, it’s just a very unique feeling to qualifying in Monaco, so definitely my favourite of the year.",Monaco,thursday,Alpine
Valtteri Bottas,"First of all it's pretty terrible what's happened out there and yeah, I hope the support keeps going. It was a surreal feeling on Wednesday, everything was packed, I was about to leave from here to drive to Imola and I got a call “it's cancelled. Stay home.” And then I was like, what do I do now? And there was this gravel cycling race in Scotland that my girlfriend was doing anyway, she was there so I found a flight and got myself and managed to get an entry to this World series race and… I had to race something because I was so hyped for Imola. Yes, I did actually. I think we saw a bit of light at the end of the tunnel, let's say, in Miami in qualifying. We managed to find good setup, good rhythm and it's shows but it is so close that once you get everything right you can actually achieve much better results than for example the race before so that was good to see and we want to keep that momentum. We were planning upgrades for Imola so now obviously we’re trialling those here and yeah, hopefully gives us an extra boost. But we're working as hard as we can to get where we want to be, which has not been the case so far this year. It is true. It's quite a challenging track, narrow, no room for any mistakes. I think in the end it’s lots of practice. We practise a lot obviously and you have simulators nowadays which can help you to get your eye in already for practice one. For sure, there are some more challenging tracks than some others but in the end it’s focus. Focus is the key issue and if you keep the concentration for each corner, each lap then you won't make a mistake. So that's the key.",Monaco,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Alex Albon,"It was OK. It was good fun. I didn't have the old team-mates back, so it was a little bit lonely, a bit more lonely than it was… what two, three years ago now? But it was for a good cause. We raised good money. And yeah, it was kind of embarrassing, actually, because the e-sports guys, there were seven or eight of them, and they're over a second quicker than you and you don't feel good. You lose your confidence. I'm going into this weekend with less confidence than I started. I was, for blue flags! Which was good timing from last year. But anyway… No, but last year I got… It was good, it was good fun. Yeah, I do. I feel like every track we've been to this year has been a huge improvement. It's been great to go into FP1s and you're already feeling better than you did in qualifying last year. Half the time we're actually even quicker, already straightaway than we were last year so there's a lot of confidence, a lot of satisfaction as well driving the car, compared to last year. So this track is a bit specific. I would say that a lot of the advantages with our new car is more high-speed related. So when you come to a track like Monaco, it goes away a little bit. But let's see. I think Monaco is a little bit of an outlier to the other circuits we go to and some teams can perform better than others just due to this unique layout. True. But you know, we're not talking… when you say a third, you think about multiple points but we were in single digits last year and we are this year, and the main thing for us is that the car really is in a better platform. I would actually say the opposite: not frustrated at all, but actually very optimistic and positive about how the season’s gone so far. Of course, we haven't scored as many points, but if you actually look at our true pace, there aren't many teams DNF-ing anymore. There aren't strange races happening. The one race there was, in Melbourne, unfortunately, I had a mistake myself so I actually look at this year very positively and hopefully we can keep building on it through the season. Yeah, only thing to add is I remember my first year it was a bit of a shock to the system to come here. I remember just because the walls are so narrow here as well that the emotion of speed is even higher than normal. So I remember my first test in Barcelona I was shocked by the speed of the Formula 1 cars and then after that you get used to it very quickly, almost straight afterwards you get used to it. But then when I came back to what… when I came to Monaco for the first time it was… yeah, as soon as you start going up the hill flat out… yeah, wet pants!",Monaco,thursday,Williams
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a good race. I mean, I stayed out of trouble at the beginning. And then yeah, just had a clean race, you know, picked the cars off one by one. And then I could stay out really long on the Hard tyres and that's where I think we made the difference today. And yeah, then a good little battle with Checo at the end. So we all kept it clean. And that's the most important and yeah, a great win today. Yeah, I mean, yesterday was, of course a bit of a setback. But today, we just kept it calm, kept clean. And yeah, for sure, winning a race from P9 is always very satisfying. Well, you know, we started talking about it yesterday. We didn't know what the weather would do, but we were quite confident that this would pay off and luckily it did today. Yeah, it's been a good one. I mean, just really staying out of trouble at the beginning. And because, of course, the people around me, you know, they tried to gain positions as quickly as possible on lap one. But knowing that, of course, you have a quick car, then once it all settles down, you just try to pick them up one by one. And that worked out quite well. I had even a three-wide on the straight, which was quite entertaining. And then yeah, we had good pace, I could look after my tyres. And then once I was in clean air, it was just about getting to that lap number we targeted. That's why maybe in the middle of that stint, I was not entirely sure if I was going to make it. But then I was getting close to the number and I said ‘OK, this is good’. So then I started pushing, I could extend the gap again, which really made my race today, I think, because once we pitted, of course, then I had the fresher tyres to the end. But also the tyres, which also were a bit more fragile today, so, yeah, then I had a good battle with Checo. I mean, we were free to race, which was said before, and yeah, we had a good go at it. But of course, most importantly, is that we don't touch but that that all worked out really well. Yeah, I mean, I was in that situation as well in Jeddah, and maybe one or two times last year. So you just have to be careful not to have any damage on your car, but it worked out well. Well, I think the key was just the general pace, plus looking after the tyres, which again, you know, on a one-stop, it might always look easy, but it's not that straightforward. But today, I think was a very good day for that. I mean, I think we have a decent advantage, especially in the race. I think over one lap in some tracks, definitely some cars will be close or in front, like you could see in Baku. But yeah, that race pace advantage, I think is quite big at the moment. But yeah, it's not like, the others are bringing new bits and we're just standing still right. So hopefully we can just keep it going like we're doing now. Yeah, this is something I wondered about already yesterday, together with my engineer. We were quite strongly opinionated on that already – then, of course, you have to discuss it with the team, with the strategists, and yeah, they were like: ‘OK. In terms of race time, it was very close between doing a Medium/Hard or Hard/Medium. It didn’t really matter. But, of course, when you start on the Hard, the risk is a bit higher because we only had one, so if you had a lap one puncture or whatever, then of course your race is a bit tougher. But I was happy to take that gamble and do it the other way around. I think even if it was the other way around, of course you always have to look after your tyres, also on the Medium – but I just felt like maybe it gave me a better opportunity to get through the field initially. Because I mean, by lap 14 I think, I was already on a podium position, so from there onwards it’s mostly about driving in clean air and you have to look after your tyres anyway. Plan A-12. 12 laps short of pit? Number one, that’s my car number, number one, that’s why. We need to do less marketing. It’s too busy. We need more free time. You’re like a life coach! The last race you’re like ‘try my brake balance!’ Did you even drive off-line? Yeah, I think it improved quite a bit over the weekend. I was a little bit afraid, of course, with the rain that it would be a bit worse, but most places were quite OK. Yeah, it's a street circuit, you can't expect it to be amazing offline, that's how it goes. But overall, I think it was a lot more fun to drive compared to last year. I think the tarmac has been a lot better. So yeah, it was absolutely fine. I think it's not a bad track. I think the first sector is quite alright. I am not a big fan of [Turns] 7, 8, because you just can't really see the apex coming like you're almost trying to look over your tyre, which is already a massive thing in the way. But the rest, like 4, 5, s6 is fun. I think a good improvement was made to the chicane this year. It was a bit more fun, how you were riding it. So it's decent? I think if I will be driving in the back nobody will be even doing anything in terms of reaction. Right? I think it's normal when you're winning and they don't like who is winning. So this is something for me which is absolutely fine as long as I stand on the top, that's for me the most important. I take the trophy home and they go back to their houses and they can have a nice evening. Yeah, rally? Yeah, for his first win in the rally car: completely different discipline. But yeah, I'm happy for him. He definitely spends a lot of time on it. It's nice when things pay off, when you put all that effort in and yet for him, of course, it's kind of a hobby, but he takes it very seriously. I got pictures and videos and to see that smile on his face. You never lose that kind of competitiveness and happiness if you do well, right, if you get rewarded for your efforts, so yeah, very happy to see him there, get the trophy. To be honest, I did have enough preparation before, to speak to my engineers and stuff for the race. But yeah, personally, I think this is just a bit of a personality thing, right? Some people like to be more in the spotlight, some people don't. I personally don't. So for me, I think that naturally, of course, what they did today is not necessary. I prefer to just talk to my engineers, walk to my car, put the helmet on and drive. But of course, I understand the entertainment value. So I just hope, of course, we don't have that every single time, because we have a very long season, so we don't need an entry like that every time. But it also depends a bit on the crowd, I think, in terms of what you want in terms of entertainment. So yeah, I think it's just a personal preference as well from the drivers. For me personally not. Yesterday I said to myself minimum P2 because I think that is where we should finish anyway with the car we have. But it's always difficult to  know, of course, what's going to happen. If you have a terrible lap one, you make it even harder for yourself, right? But luckily it didn't work out too bad, just making sure you didn't have any damage on the car but then again, it's all about how the performance is of the car and how well you feel in the car, how much you can extract out of it. And lucky that all worked out very well today so then of course you can move forward and win the race.",Miami,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I mean, I tried. I gave it all, you know. I think the first stint was really poor, with the graining that we had on that initial pace. And that compromised, quite a lot, our race, because we didn't have too much of a difference on tyre. And Max was particularly strong today. So a well-deserved win for him. I think the Medium initially was really poor, worse than unexpected. And yeah, I think that really compromised our pace. And then, you know, honestly, I think also Max had tremendous pace on the Hard tyre and I think I’ve got to analyse what went wrong with today because we simply didn't have the pace. Yeah, it started well, but very early on, I saw that the Medium was very fragile, initially, so I had to protect the tyre quite a lot just to make lap 15 or so. And it was really hard to lean on that tyre. Basically, the whole right hand side was really difficult. And yeah, I could see that Max was closing up on the Hard. And from that point on, I knew that the race was looking difficult. And then when I went onto the Hard, Max had very strong pace, so we didn't manage to open a gap. So yeah, he simply came too close to us. And we had a bit of a fight on track, which was quite clean – to the limit, but clean and obviously putting the team the team in front of us. Again, a great team result, but obviously, today Max deserved the victory because he was the strongest car out there. I don't know if the rain overnight did affect more the Medium than it did to the Hard. But yeah, it just felt quite fragile, quite easy to make some damage on it and that's my thoughts at the moment. I don't know more. Yeah, I think, as I say, I wasn't able to look after them properly. I don't know how different it would looked, the race, for Max, if he was on the on the same strategy as myself, but he was clearly the fastest car out there. I have to understand what went wrong today. And it's pretty simple: when you don't have the race pace then it's really hard to win the race. So well done to Max today. No. When you are starting on pole, starting on the Hard is much more like a gamble that can go right or wrong with Safety Cars and, I think at the time, none of us were expecting the Medium to be… because pretty much the whole grid went for the Medium start, I think none of us realised how weak of a tyre it was. I think once we did a few laps on it, we realised that it was quite a poor tyre. It was a lot easier, compared to last year. I think yeah, the race was a little cooler, and it was much more intense, my race, this year than last year, so overall it was quite a lot easier. I think it’s hard to answer this one because you don’t know what the tyres would have done. Certainly my mileage would have looked a little bit better simply be spending less time on the Medium compound. That was very weak today. Yeah, basically, my marketing team left it too late, so I need to tell them. I was late for the Drivers’ Parade, so I have to go to the… Yeah, I think the main problem is only Turn 7, 8, going offline a little bit offline and then there is no grip. It's like ice there. So maybe if there can be some improvement there, but the rest of the circuit has been a very good improvement. Well, I just want to thank them for all their support. I think today the support they gave me, I really wanted the win, it would have meant a lot to me. But yeah, it's about not giving up. It's a long season ahead and we’ve got to keep pushing, and hopefully many, many more good moments for all of us coming ahead. I think as long as we don't do it on too many occasions, I think it's nice to do it once for the crowd, but we also have to be very respectful of the drivers, that we need our own time to get ready. It's just minutes before the race start and I think as long as this doesn't happen very often, it's OK. Yeah, obviously at the end of the day we have to put the team ahead of us. We are just two drivers but there's so many people working back home and working really hard we have to show respectful.  In the end we had a really good fight between us and I think a bit more will have mean contact and I don't think that will have been fair for any of us. Only for Fernando!",Miami,post-race,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Not bad. The car is amazing. And yeah, a little bit of a lonely race today. And nothing really to do in front of us, with the Red Bulls, and behind us. Maybe we did expect a little bit stronger opposition, but the Ferraris, they were little bit worse than expected today. So yeah, not easy, it's never easy, but it was a lonely race. Yeah, it is. It is always. On the start, obviously, on the wrong side of the grid we were a bit worried but yeah, everything was fine, we take the podium and going into the triple – Imola, Monaco and Barcelona – so hopefully we can keep on going. I think at the beginning of the year a podium was amazing. Now after four podiums we want obviously more and at least a second place. But, you know, the two Red Bulls they are always unbreakable and they are always super-fast. But as I said, maybe Monaco, maybe Barcelona we have a possibility. Ha! Why? We have something with the guys, with the mechanics. But yeah, I did enjoy. I think the race for us, it was a little bit of a lonely race. Nothing really to do in front of us with the Red Bulls but behind us, not much pressure, so yeah, at the end P3, and we take this good result for us, fourth podium in five races, we only miss Baku by eight-tenths of a second, so yeah, I think it’s a good moment so far. It is! It is. Obviously, we want to step on step higher on the podium for P2 and eventually one day we have an opportunity to win a race – but at the moment it didn’t happen because Red Bull is better than us. It’s stronger, it’s faster and the reliability has been always outstanding for them as well, finishing both cars in every race. So, yeah, if one day there is a crack there, if there is an opportunity, we need to make sure we are in that position and we’re still not making mistakes at any point in the weekend. Maybe we can have some explanation – but we will keep it for us. Let’s see. I think in Imola it’s going to be an interesting fight again. As you said, a lot of teams will bring upgrades to the car. Mercedes, probably Ferrari as well and we will try to keep finishing in front of them on Sunday. What happened? 30 seconds penalty! And me, I did a mistake! I was just telling them which lap I think the tyre will be in good shape before the stop. And then yeah, I make a mistake, because Plan A-12 it was already gone a few laps before that. A few seconds later I said sorry, they were already laughing on the radio. So they realised I was telling something stupid. I think this circuit we have big TV screens out of some of the slow-speed corners so it was very easy to follow the race on TV. I saw one overtake to the Alpines, or to the Alfa Romeo and I was just curious which position it was. It was a little bit of an unexpected lonely race for us. We were thinking to have a more difficult race. I think it was very good. Also the DRS… I did! Overtaking the Alpine and the Ferrari. I think Max was P2 by lap 14, so plenty of DRS distance, and a lot of overtakings. But eventually you are in the position you deserve with your car pace and there are no more overtakings from that point. But it’s not a problem of the rules or the circuit. It’s just the nature of Formula 1. I think the year is going to be difficult. The gap is quite big even though I think today has been our best race pace yet in the season. We finish, I think, closest to the leaders, no safety cars, nothing in the race and we’re still quite fast. So let's see. I think the season is going to be long. Hopefully some of the tracks we will be a little bit closer to them. And some of the upgrades that we will bring later in the season maybe put us in a different or more competitive position. But I think our main focus, to be honest, is just looking behind and trying to keep Mercedes and Ferrari in the Constructors’ Championship under control. But I think Red Bull, we have to accept they are doing a better job than everyone else and we need to do a better job. I understand the point of view of everybody but I'm not a big fan of those kinds of things just before the race. If we have to do it, I think we need to remove some of the other stuff we are doing like the parade lap or something like that, because it's really in the middle of the preparation with the engineers and the strategy meeting. And I disagree a little bit if we do it, we have to do it everywhere because I don't think that the Miami fans are better than the Italian fans in Imola or in Spain or in Mexico or in Japan. I think we need to make everyone with the same rules and the same show before the race.",Miami,post-race,Aston Martin
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it was a very tricky Quali for all. I think it's very difficult to find the right feeling with the tyres around this tarmac and it was a fight the whole way through Quali and very easy to make mistakes. It was getting windier and windier, which for our cars and for our car in particular is quite tricky to drive. But yeah, in general, a decent outcome. P3 is more or less where we were targeting to be, but I think today we would have been even better. Yeah, it’s the big unknown going into tomorrow. How is our car going to perform in the heat and in the race runs. Normally, it’s our weakness, but I think this weekend we should try and make a better job than in the last one. And I think that could bring us to the podium, which would be a good result. No, I think the Red Bull is the Red Bull. They are just very quick. But then everyone else, it's going to be a good fight with Fernando, with Mercedes that are a bit behind. The other Aston. I don't know. I think it's going to be an exciting race. Yeah, plenty, actually today, yes, because obviously with the red flag I think we all had a quite a lot of lap time to come in the second run. I was actually doing a very good first sector when the red flag came out, but it's how it goes. We're P3, which is more than where we were planning to be. Yeah, definitely. It's been back to the feeling I had in Australia. So yeah, it kind of confirms that Baku was an outlier and a very strange weekend for me. The strangest probably in my F1 career – I'm not going to lie – and the toughest. But now, back in Miami, the feeling straight away from FP1 was back to normal. I was on the pace, I've been in the pace from FP2 to FP3, building it up through Qualifying. Bit of a pity that we couldn't extract the performance of the car today because there was definitely a lot more in it. But yeah, with the red flags and things, and with the new tyre being so peaky around here, it's always difficult to put it together. We've changed a few things but it's a tough sport to comprehend sometimes. I'm not going to lie. It's a very tough sport to understand. Sometimes you just put the car on track and there's things that are not working or not feeling how they should and, yes, we have tonnes of sensors, tonnes of data but it's sometimes very difficult to spot exactly what's happening but I was so sure and so convinced after Baku that there was something that was not quite right, that it kind of confirms the fact that this weekend everything feels normal again and I'm back to where I was in Melbourne in terms of pure pace. It is very difficult, yeah. I had my moments through the high speed section also in FP3, which kind of confirms that the car around there, it's just very tricky. We have a very peaky car, a very, let's say, unstable car in the high speed and the sometimes generates mistakes – in this case accidents – but both Charles and I were trying everything we can, you know, to put the car on the limit, to put it where the car deserves to be, which in my opinion, this weekend, it's just behind the Red Bulls. But yeah, in Q3, I didn't have the best lap in the first run and Fernando beat us. So yeah, we will make sure that we try to take the car to do what it can do. I think it will be an interesting start. I think it always is around here. I think last year there was also a decent difference between inside and outside into Turn 1, and we will see how it pans out, no? But I think we're fighting the Astons… who is behind me, P4? Magnussen? Interesting! Kevin, strange one, but he sometimes can pull it off, like we've seen many times. I think with Fernando and for sure Max will come from behind and will pass us both, it’s normally what should happen because in race pace we saw like, we've seen this year six, eight-tenths of difference, which is around a 50-something lap race is a big, big gap. Yeah, I mean the plan at the start, like always, is to attack because that's what starts are there for you know? Try and gain as many positions as possible and then, normally what we've seen this year is that the Aston and Fernando are a bit quicker in race pace than what we are, because they take better care of tyres, they have less deg, or whatever it is – which we are still trying to find out, and still trying to improve in our car. But let's see how overtaking is, let's see where we are after lap one and in the end, it’s like Fernando said: we will finish the race where we deserve and it will be another good learning point. Yeah, very happy to be here, of course, and be part of this this time. To my right, there are two very talented drivers but also two very good persons that I enjoy being around with. We always have good conversations, we always get on very well between each other and this is also why it's particularly fun to be sharing the front row, but also, I agree with Checo that it would be even better to share a bit of champagne. I think yesterday we already expressed our feelings to the FIA about the situation of the DRS. We got very specific feedback and it is something that is going to work probably differently in the next few races. But for me, I don't think 75 metres of DRS changes what's going to happen tomorrow. It's probably maybe not in the direction that this sport was going with a show and with overtaking and trying to make overtaking easier to shorten the DRS zones, but it is also not like 75 metres of DRS or whatever they've done is going to change the whole race. I don't think it's going to be a very different picture and overtaking like always in F1 is always a challenge, it's always difficult and I expect it to be difficult tomorrow. Yeah, I actually think the tarmac has a very high grip in the racing line. Actually, the grip is very good. It's just the contrast that there is between the racing line and offline is what, compared to other circuits, is what is the most difficult thing to manage and to handle, especially in cooldown laps when you're cooling the tyres and when you're overtaking people offline it is very tricky, but I think this surface and this tarmac is better than what it was last year and just needs some ageing and need some more racing on top.",Miami,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, it was a good qualifying. I think FP3 was a bit messy for us. We tried different set-ups and they didn't work, but the team obviously put the car in a more known place after the first four races and the car came alive in Qualifying. So yeah, certainly happy with P2 obviously, first row of the grid. Let's see what we can do. Perfect. I did enjoy every lap, you know. It was so enjoyable to drive, especially the low-speed corners here are quite tricky, you go quite close to the walls between Turns 11 and 16, so you need to have that confidence in the car to really attack qualifying and I had the confidence today, so I was very pleased. Yeah, probably. I think it was difficult the whole weekend. It is a very narrow racing line that we are cleaning and it gets quite grippy but offline it gets quite slippery. Yeah, we need to have an eye on the weather as well. There are some forecasts that says rain tomorrow. If that comes, obviously it's going to be a new thing. I think I've been always motivated, I mean always working hard, but I didn't have probably, you know, the team believing on my performance, on my ability to set-up the car as well and to move forward. And also, I never had as fast a car as I have now, so you know I think that's the reason. I didn't change anything but Aston Martin changed everything on me. Yeah, it was a good qualifying. I think we've been up and down in the last two events. I think Baku was very difficult with only one free practice. Here, with a more normal weekend, we've been experimenting a little bit with set-up and different options on the car. And yeah, I think we put it all together for Qualifying, the car felt good. And yeah, obviously the Q3 was stopped with a red flag at the end, so we don't know what lap time, at the end, everyone could achieve. I think there was a lot of pace in the car still because the Q3 lap was made on a used tyre on the first attempt. So up to the yellow flag I was a few tenths already better than the lap before. So yeah, I think that it was something more than the car, but obviously we take the first row of the grid and let's see what we can do. A lot. I think Sunday is our day, normally. I think the car take care of the tyre normally very good, and we have a very good race pace and we struggle a little bit on Saturday. So, when we start higher up normally things are a little bit easier. But yeah, we have a strong opposition behind. Ferrari has been very strong this weekend and in Baku, some upgrades also on their car. Max obviously will come, eventually in the race, quite fast. So yeah, a lot of things to take care of in the mirrors. But we will do our race, we will score as many points as possible and our main competitors, Mercedes, they had a difficult weekend so far, so we need to keep outscoring them. Nice! I don't think that we have to target a win, especially after how the weekend went. I think even the podium is going to be difficult but, you know, we do our race. We've been doing this the whole season, we are in a privileged position, we never expected to be here. So, every lap we do, every race lap that we will do tomorrow in these kind of positions is a gift at the moment. So, I think the team is enjoying it. We will try to pass Checo into Turn 1, because we love to lead the race, at least for a few laps. And after that, it’s just… we will end up in the position we deserve. If it’s P5, it’s going to be P5. If it’s P7, P7. If it’s another podium it will be fantastic. But I think it's going to be a tough race. I don't know. I've been probably in the top four to five every qualifying except the Baku Sprint qualifying. So, I think that was the aim for today. Obviously free practice was a little bit of a concern, that we were not that competitive. We took some risk also in Q1. Unfortunately for Lance it was the problem there, but yeah, our aim is to have a simple weekend, not to do too crazy things and put the car in the position we deserve, which normally on Sundays we are a little bit more competitive. And keep learning about the car. And I don't know but I think today has been a good day. But obviously Max didn't complete the lap, Charles also had some issues and we just, as I said, put the lap and delivered the job in Q3, which is why we are paying off. I will not say anything wrong, but I will answer in Spanish. (Answers in Spanish) Very, very bad things! Yes. I was saying that, as Checo said, it is quite a big day and yeah, we should reply in Spanish as well because a lot of following in Formula 1 and in sports in general and the world, so many millions of people are speaking Spanish and I was just replying in Spanish. I think it was down to being the first cars, probably, on the circuit. We don't have any support races; I think Porsche Cup or whatever is racing here but probably we are missing F3, F2 or other categories to help us to clean the circuit. This is going to be better next year. But offline is quite dusty. It's going to be difficult to overtake someone because the dust that you put in the tyre it will remain for the following two or three corners. So it's going to be difficult but I think the grip level was okay. By now in qualifying I think the racing line grip feels good. But I think it was just a coincidence that it was too new and we were the first cars to race on this new asphalt.",Miami,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"I think it’s been my worst weekend up to qualifying really, I just couldn't figure out how to pull those tenths that I was missing all the time to Max and to the Ferraris. I mean, I was just re-setting everything, we did a small change into Qualifying and everything became more alive. And I think with this tarmac we were just playing a bit with the tools and we put the lap in when it mattered. Just everything. It wasn't coming together. It's one of those weekends where I was just struggling for balance, confidence. This tarmac is very sensitive to temperature, so thank you to everyone. No, I'm enjoying it. I'm just thinking race by race. I will go out and cheer for my team because they've done a tremendous job and, yeah, just see what happens tomorrow. You know, tomorrow. It's a new opportunity. Starting from pole. We are the ones that have some effort to lose, but we will just go out there and try to enjoy this amazing crowd. I'm very pleased, you know, because it's been a very difficult weekend for me up to Qualifying. I think this tarmac is just very different to anything else. And I was just trying to figure out how to get the maximum out of the car, out of the balance, because even on my final lap, I was still finding things out that were working better. So we haven't had a straightforward weekend. So it tastes a lot better once you deliver under such a bad weekend. No, it wasn't as bad. I think if things turned to bad, probably I will be P4 or P3. But no, Melbourne, hopefully never again. But I was just far and literally far with balance with confidence. And I think it's one of those weekends where if things don't go in your favour, then you just start to lose confidence and you start to overthink things. And yeah, I'm just so pleased that I delivered when it mattered, because I had a pretty good idea through Qualifying. I think I managed to learn a lot. And yeah, just put the lap when it really mattered. I think the race it’s a lot easier. And already yesterday I had a very good pace, although I was struggling for balance. Straightaway, we put fuel in the car and things come more naturally to me. The problem was putting the tyres up to temperature and taking that little 10th, you know, of peak grip, I was struggling with that massively. Well, at the moment these two guys obviously. I'm mainly focusing now on getting a good start and being able to manage our first stint. I think it will be really helpful for all of us to be able to do that. You know, it's a very long race and still a lot can happen tomorrow. I reply in Spanish? I think I'm just really happy because I really like these two guys. I think we get on well and probably it doesn't mean much for us right now but when we look at it in a few years, we will remember this day and hopefully we can share the podium tomorrow, it will be really nice, for one day. It just shows that still the Hispanic community can fight. Yeah, it's a very special weekend for me. I have a lot of friends. Obviously, the Mexican and Latin community here is very big, so it will be really special for me to get the victory. It will be even more special. I think all the wins are super good but this one will mean a little bit more. But still a very long race ahead. I'm not really thinking about that. For now, I just found focus on my race preparation and yeah, get through it. I was mainly missing confidence. When I was looking at the data and seeing what Max was able to do, I could not see… I could simply not do that and I was struggling a lot. It was not small differences, it was quite big. And yeah, we did a good one good change, which I won't go into too much in detail obviously but also just learning about the asphalt, I think, through qualifying and playing with a balance and finding that rhythm was much more important than I really thought so I really got a good understanding in qualifying finally. So yeah, now looking forward myself for tomorrow. I'm sure that will be able to translate that into a race pace. I agree with Carlos, with a lot of what he said. Yeah, I really hope that it evolves through the future. Hopefully next year it can be even better. And I think the big problem is offline as well. If you go a little bit off, then that's it really, you have like ice out of the racing line. So that to me is the biggest concern and hopefully that can be the biggest improvement. And hopefully, they can do another step. They’ve done a really good job for this weekend but hopefully when we come back next year it can be a bit more raceable, this asphalt where we can be offline and have more racing.",Miami,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Logan Sargeant,"I thought I was going to get away from that, sitting in the middle, but I guess not. No, it's good. It was nice to get home after Baku. I was able to spend two days at home to really recharge, get out on the water which was nice. And yeah, I'm excited for this weekend. It's nice to be back in my well known climate, which is extremely hot but it's going to be a tough weekend, not knowing the track. It's a big hurdle to climb. But yeah, I'm excited.",Miami,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"I did enjoy it, massively. It was awesome just to have an experience in a proper NASCAR, the new generation car as well. And it was not just a small run in a demo car or anything like that, it was like proper… new tyres and yeah, they properly throw the full experience on it. We did some drag racing as well so not only NASCAR we did, we had the full American racing experience. And yeah, that was very nice. Yeah, yeah, it was just amazing, just to be able to chat with him about his career, how he has evolved as an athlete. And he's one of the top guys out there so just to be able to share some of that, it's been a great thing for me. And, yeah, I'm having the full experience. I'm enjoying Miami very much. I entered the track with Vin Diesel earlier so it's pretty crazy. Yeah, I think we obviously leave that weekend behind. We try and focus on the positives that we had, which is that the updates that we had were working. We didn't use it the proper way and the way it should have been. Doing only three laps in FP1 and just fixing the setup from there on has been very tricky for us. So we didn't use the car the proper way, we didn’t optimise it and we couldn't really see the performance of the car. But we have three sessions here to turn things around, bounce back and that's what we're looking to do. Everywhere you go you have a piano with you? I think I agree. Everything's been said. He asked me that actual same question. He said what do you think? If you had a quick car, probably the best car, where would you be? And obviously, I always trust my abilities like all of us, we always think we are the best. Yeah, that's how it is in Formula 1. I'm sure we are working on getting cars closer throughout the field and that one day, we all are going to have a shot at winning the title and that's what I'm definitely hoping for. And that's what I told him as well. But in the meantime just keep pushing, there are interesting fights also, not only for P1 but for the other teams it’s very close, just behind, for a lot of positions. It can swing all the way and there can be some big fights in there. So far, that's where we are, but I'm not sure it's going to stay for a very long time like that. I mean, I agree that it's a little bit more difficult. I think also, you know, shortening up the DRS things doesn't help at all, as we discussed before. But there is something that you know, we haven't been through yet, is that we've done three races with no degradation at the moment, which, you know, creates more difficulties to overtake I think. In Bahrain, we've seen much more overtaking than the last three and there was no deg in Australia, no deg in Jeddah, no deg in Baku. Let's see if there are some here with the new tarmac. But yeah, I think as soon as there's a bit more degradation, there's more fights and more fun on track. Is water this year? Yeah. Hey mom, that's me. I'm on TV. Look, I'm in the movie!",Miami,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"If they are ready to be into depressing music then I'm probably the one to go to. But yeah, my music is not that good. I am a racing driver and I did that out of fun. I released the first music before Azerbaijan. I'm releasing the second one after Miami. And yeah, it's something I enjoy, though. No. I've checked actually, we spoke about this with Nyck because Nyck is also playing the piano. Starting. Yeah, it was good. After the first three races it was really bad. We obviously were very unlucky in Bahrain, being in third and having that technical issue already a penalty for the second race. And then the DNF with the incident with Lance in Australia, so it couldn't be worse. But in Azerbaijan, it went really well. We had our first pole which is great. I think it confirms how strong a car we have, especially in qualifying but then in the race we confirmed a little bit our weaknesses that we still need to work on our race pace as the Red Bull is just too strong for now. Should go in the right direction; I don't think it will be enough to fight with them but yeah, it will go in the right direction, I'm sure. Well, I think he's just starting this process now. Until now he was basically trying to analyse the situation as quickly as possible in order to do the best changes possible for the future. So yeah, I think the big part of the job will be done from now on so we will see. Obviously I speak a lot with Fréd and I know what are his middle and long term plans for the team, and I’m completely behind him and I trust him fully. So I'm sure these are the right choices and it goes in the right direction for the team. So for that, I'm looking forward to it. But yeah, let's wait and see. Yeah, I don't think it’s the right direction. I think with the cars that we have at the moment, it's still quite difficult to follow. It’s better than the previous generation cars but still not good enough to actually have less DRS, so hopefully in the future races we won't shorten them. Well, I'll do my best to not make it boring but at the end it's a sport. It's like in every sport, sometimes a team is just better than others and at the moment it’s the case with Red Bull. We are working flat out like everybody, I think, here is working flat out to try and recover the gap to the Red Bulls. I think on one lap, we can maybe challenge them. In the race it’s going to be more difficult but if there's an opportunity, I'll do my best to make it more exciting. Yeah, nothing to add on the technical parts. Maybe as a driver, I felt like this year it's a bit more difficult to follow in the low-speed corners, especially compared to the high-speed. So that's where we struggle a little bit more but yeah, George said it all. No, I don't think it is. I mean, at the end, one more camera or one less camera, I don't think we realise it that much. I think it's amazing for the sport, though, I think it is great. It gives us really big visibility, a big reach to people that might not know or might not be interested so much into Formula 1, just for them to understand it in a better way, in a more lucrative way. And with the movie, I think it’s the best possible way. So no, or at least for me, it won't add any pressure. But I don't think for anybody, as we are getting used to having cameras around.",Miami,thursday,Ferrari
George Russell,"Yeah, it's good. I think for all of us it's fun to come here. Like in the atmosphere, standing on South Beach and a nice run down the coast. And it's going to be a good weekend. Definitely tricky, for sure. I think last year for all of us it was one of the toughest races of the season. But I think it's exciting when it's difficult. Nobody wants an easy ride and it gives you an opportunity to do something better than the rest but for sure when you're sat in that car for almost two hours you're sweating it out. I'm not too sure. It’s fine margins I think. We missed out on Q3 by four milliseconds and that would have been a totally different story had we got into Q3, and probably we could have qualified inside the top six but clearly our car isn't quick enough. We need to continue to do a better job and we'll go again this weekend. Hopefully, there'll be a slightly smoother weekend and we can battle out with Aston and Ferrari. No, I will continue racing the same way as I always would. A lot has been said about that coming together but from my side, it was pretty straightforward. I went for a move, got the move done and moved on. Obviously he was pretty upset about it but that’s racing and these things happen. And we're all here to fight so that's what everyone's about. No, again, from my side there's no air to be cleared. I'll welcome and say hello to him if he passes by and I'm sure we'll shake hands when we bump into each other. For me it's history now and it's behind us. Yeah, my view to him is still the same, I still respect him, I still think he's a great driver and obviously things were always said in the heat of the moment but yeah, we move on. I think all of us didn't really understand why they've been shortened. None of us were consulted about it or asked our opinion on it and I think the race speaks for itself in Baku. I don't know whether we're going to keep it the same for this weekend. DRS is there to aid overtaking and it's always exciting when you've got these big DRS advantages and it gives you the opportunity to fight and clearly in Baku it was way too short. I'm confident we'll make progress but of course we want the competition. I think the competition we've got at the moment between Ferrari and Aston Martin… every race we go to is really close between us in qualifying. The pace is really close in the race and if that was the fight for victory, it would probably be one of the most exciting seasons we've seen in a long, long time. And it's obviously just a shame that there's two more cars well out in front? So yeah, forget about those two and just watch the race for P3. It may be a bit more exciting. But yeah, it's challenging. I think in no sport, you never want to see somebody dominating. You want to have that competition and that's what we all want. In an ideal world, you have 20 drivers and 10 teams all capable of winning every single weekend, if you do the right job. I think it is. I don't know exactly why that is. I think obviously, you know, F1 created these regulations to help overtaking and following, and since they were introduced every single team has sort of developed naturally away from their initial intentions, as you sort of develop the car. So every car on the grid is very different compared to what, let's say, they were intended to look like 18 months ago or two years ago now or whenever it was. And yeah, I think the overtaking is slowly getting more difficult but also because the slipstream isn't as large as well with these new cars so it's slowly going in the wrong direction for overtaking. Yeah, nothing more to say. I think at the end of day, we all want the best races, the most exciting races. And there's probably a few easier ways to achieve this in the short term, like Esteban said about the tyre degradation, you know, it's been easy one-stops in the last couple of races. And when everybody's pushing flat out, there are less exciting races, obviously the DRS has gone in the wrong direction. So there's a couple of small things, but you know, for sure, we're going to speak with the FIA and F1 about this because, you know, we want to be able to race, we want to be able to fight, as we all did in in go-karts, where there was no aerodynamics. So that's the ultimate dream. And, you know, I think the sport took a really good turn for the better when these new cars were introduced, but we need to take it to the next step now. I think it's well for a couple of races now it's been challenging to overtake. For sure, Baku wasn't the most exciting race in the world. But there are a number of factors for that, but yeah, there should never be a knee-jerk reaction but we were all talking about this issue prior to the race in Baku, and then the race obviously went on to be as dull as we all expected. And it's challenging for everybody. Obviously, we're pushing Pirelli to deliver a good tyre, a consistent tyre and when it is difficult, you know, the drivers, myself included, we don't like it. But in an ideal world, you have a very strong tyre, which at a certain point falls off the cliff and means you have to do a few more pit stops and gives it some different opportunities in the races. But yeah, I'm not too sure really.",Miami,thursday,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. The back end of an IndyCar, like an IndyCar engine, the new one, and the front end of an NSX GT3. So it was quite an interesting combo. It was on road tyres. So it was sliding around quite a bit. But it was good fun. I mean, when you have to do these kinds of things, I definitely prefer that to sitting around somewhere talking. I was on the road course. Yeah. It was good. I enjoyed it. Yeah, I mean, we had that competition, of course, for every US Grand Prix, that [fans] can design a bit of our car. So I think that came out quite nicely and then you plan the helmet. It's just a nice place to be. It's pretty relaxed in terms of the atmosphere. Of course, it's quite busy for us throughout the week. But yeah, we always enjoy getting down here. I hope so! I think the cause is very quick. But yeah, let's see. I mean, we know in qualifying it's close. But then in the race normally our car, it's pretty good. Yeah, it was very tough, very humid. I do feel so far, it's maybe a little bit colder. I mean, it’s still warm, but let's see once we sit in the cars, but I expect it to be a tough weekend here. Well, I would prefer of course that we could race without DRS but that's not possible. I think for us, of course, it's a little bit different. I mean, if the car is faster than the one… let's say when you have to come to the field from the back, it doesn't really matter how long the zone is, you will get the car ahead. But when the pace is within a tenth, or two-tenths, you could see that in Baku, I think, once you're in a bit of a DRS train, there's no chance and even when the leading car of the train… the DRS zone is just not big enough to have a run.  So, what is that? Is the DRS zone too short?  Are the cars not good enough to follow closely? I think it's a bit of a combination of both, with the cars are probably too heavy, they're too stiff, so you can't really run a kerb to try to find a bit of a different line because it's all quite… everyone is driving more or less the same line nowadays because of just how the cars work, and how stiff the suspension is. And yeah, probably now, with people finding more and more downforce in the cars, it probably becomes a bit harder to follow as well. Terrible! No, of course not. That’s what people maybe like to hear. But no, it's absolutely fine. No, I mean, I think sometimes some tracks probably suit you a bit better. and probably for Checo, his driving style and the way he likes the car probably suits a bit better to a street circuit. I personally don't really enjoy street circuits. So probably there is also something in that. I prefer more the fast corners, but that's how it goes. You have a few street circuits on the calendar, a few normal tracks as well. Well, nothing will influence anything to ‘28 because I have a contract so but yeah, I'm very happy of course, that Adrian stays, but that goes for everyone in the team, right? I mean, when you're doing really well, you want to try and keep that whole group together. And that's of course also the target for the team for the future. [to Lando] You’re all about the vibe, so explain it. Maybe you do one, then you do one. Nico take the track. But you have driven with a road car! [To Lando] And your vibe. How's the vibe? It’s so early on in the season, we know that we have a very quick car. So, it's quite normal that it's between the two of us, right? At the moment. So there is nothing new there. And yeah, between us, we have a good understanding, good relationship. So I think what we want to focus on I think, is just to try and make the car better and faster to try and stay ahead of everyone else. That's the main objective. And then the rest, you will do on the track anyway. I think they are a bit more stable when you're following. Like, the other generation, you could have massive oversteer or understeer in high speed or low speed. Now, yeah, you lose downforce, but it's a bit more understeer, a little bit more oversteer, nothing really drastic. But like I said before, I think of course that improved – but because of the stiffness of the cars, how you have to run them, it takes a little bit of that magic away – especially on a street circuit where you could ride a kerb here and there. So yeah, that probably is a bit tough, around Baku, but also around Singapore, that makes it very hard. Yeah, I don't know. I think in general, what we have to try and get away from it – but it's very hard – is just a weight increase. When you jump back in an old car, and you go out, you definitely feel the difference in how agile an old car was. But that's like early, for me, early 2010. Before that, they were even lighter, right? So, I don't know how we can solve that. Also the bigger wheels, they’re quite a bit heavier as well. So that for me goes in the wrong direction. But I don't know what we can do about you know, turning it around.",Miami,thursday,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah, well, we did try and go one up on the basketball, which was a fan favourite last year, so we had to try and come up with something that we thought could compete with that, which is tough. We thought of you know doing a golf ball, but yeah, we’ll let Alex do that one. And we came up with a beach ball, so just something fun you know, it's a nice place to do something like that. And I wouldn't say it's a trend of something I'll do here every year but yeah, people seem to like it last year. So we wanted to do the same. The season started a few races ago, but I guess we were playing a little bit of catch-up from where we should have been, honestly. I think we have a good, let's say, baseline to really work from now, more confidence to be able to work from where we are. But we've not had a bad year. I know people keep saying we've had a bad year and such a terrible start and I guess we have, if we want to say we want to win races and so on, but we should have scored points in the first race of the season, we potentially could have scored them in a second. We just got unlucky with the damage and things like that. And then we've had a good race in Australia and a better race in Baku. So, nothing's bad. I think we are just in that middle spot at the minute and it's close between us and Alpine, AlphaTauri, Haas at times, Alfa Romeo. Everyone is there or thereabouts so it's just a close battle. One day we’ll look a bit better and the next day we’ll look a little bit worse but it's enjoyable. Just I guess similar to where we were. I don't expect too many more things. The car is the same as last weekend, so maybe just trying to understand the new parts that we brought to Baku, which I think we have, so maybe exploit them a little bit more. The rest is just trying to get a couple of points. You know, we have four teams that are considerably ahead of where we are. Every now and then we can maybe get close, but it comes to the race and they are another league compared to us. So we are kind of fighting for ninth and 10th at the minute, which doesn't sound like a lot, but the small points will add up. Yeah, I think that was proven in the race in Baku. I don't think I've too many things to add. Max explained it pretty well to be honest. We've been through it, I think it's been discussed. We discussed it already last week. I know they shortened it here again in the two zones. I mean, we're the slowest on the straights, so I’d love DRS at every chance we have. Yeah, I think there's something to just review, you know? I think if we look back at last year, maybe at times you could have shortened it – but as cars evolve and get more downforce, generally it always makes the racing a little bit worse, which is kind of led a little bit down that path. Cars are becoming more efficient, at the same time. So, you need that little extra to help you. So it just needs to be re-reviewed, you know, and not to use data from last year, but just look at what's been happening this year, and then review it. So, in my opinion, probably extend, but depends on who you’re racing. Red Bull doesn't even need DRS, and for us, we need everything we’ve got, in a way. So it depends who you're racing against, and some of the differences, but there'll be some races, which will be a lot better, and some races which are tougher. And like Max said, there's certain things we're just not able to do nowadays that we could do maybe a few years ago, which made it easier to overtake – like take kerbs and do different lines and things like that. So, it's not as simple as just DRS. There’s many things to try and improve and do better. But, yeah, we’re  talking and we're trying to do what we can to make it better for the sport. The vibe’s pretty sick so far. I don't know what you want me to say to be honest. I think everyone enjoys it here. It's just good fun. Like you said, good weather and so on. Cool. A lot of different people come here. So a big weekend in terms of partners and brands, for us especially: we have a lot of American brands. So, I guess you have that side of it. And a lot of them are coming here. So you want a good weekend. And that just makes it enjoyable at the same time. I like the track, I guess there are some changes, nothing too big. The biggest one being the tarmac. As long as the tarmac stays down and doesn't come up like last year, then I think we're in a better position. So we'll see. There's some rain expected for Sunday at the same time. Some thunderstorms, so yeah, we'll find out soon. It's a good vibe. What's it like? Honestly, just as a genuine, genuine answer, it's not too different. I think how I worked last year, and how I worked with Daniel, it's not too different, you not like too many things change. Maybe they lean on me a little bit more for the knowledge of how we were in previous years, to look at the development from last year to this year and things like that. But apart from that, you both give your sides of the feelings and the story of what's going on to the car, what you want from the car –  which aligns very well. I wouldn't say we have the same driving style, but our comments and complaints are generally always the same. So, I think that's a good thing. He's a lovely guy, down to earth, normal guy, hard worker and so on. So it's good, fun. Different, I guess to Daniel. I feel like a bit of a contrast of Australian but still good fun. He's very fast at the same time. So probably been pushing me a little bit more than the past couple years. So yeah, enjoyable. No, it doesn't work exactly like that. I think, say like the new floor we have now, it's more of a different philosophy, different understanding of how things work. I guess that was kind of found during the winter already, just a little bit too late. The rest is not as simple as that. It's not just one big thing. People do come up with different ideas and different ways of doing things. It's also the efficiency of work, especially with the budget cap now and time with CFD and wind tunnel. It's about the efficiency and how you work through things and coming up with the ideas from that side of it. And working from there, and just how people work together at the same time, just the teamwork and team ethic of it all. So it's not like we don't have the correct people. We got a lot of clever people and I think a lot of people that can help us move forward. It's just how people work together. And just the structure of it all, I think that makes a bigger difference than a lot of people think from the outside. It’s nothing big. It’s not like me miss massive things. It's just chipping away and finding little things and putting them all together by the end of the week and going from there. And the efficiency of work. It’s probably just more efficient and over time, over weeks and months, you see a bigger change from that.",Miami,thursday,McLaren
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I went home on Sunday night. And then one day I went to a concert of my friend JJ [Lin], and then had a bit of fun, just one day of racing, and then straight back to Miami. So I went to the baseball game for the first ever time, with the Miami Marlins and that’s actually the first ever time for me to throw a baseball. I had to do it on the first pitch. So yeah, there was a higher chance of me bottling it rather than throwing it to the player. But I made it stick. So yeah, it was all good. It was a great experience. No, it's great. I don't know, the stadium is kind of like a cinema, you know, people getting like, nice, fast food, popcorn. And they enjoy that with their family. So it's great to see. Luckily not, because I'm not as good a singer as him, so.. but yeah, he did shout out my name. But obviously unfortunately I was covered into the crowd of fans he had so the camera couldn't really get to my face. But no, it was a great concert. I really loved it. And he's doing his world tour obviously., so… Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's clear, you know, we're not exactly where we want to be as a team and let's say in Australia we got a bit lucky with all the red flags, staying out of trouble, but in general, you know, people are bringing updates and they seem to be working in a bigger range compared to us and yeah, Baku, obviously, also here, we have the same car basically and we have to kind of just make sure that we can get over all the issues we had in Baku, as clearly it wasn't a competitive enough weekend for us and we do struggle a lot, especially in the race, you know, just to the guys who we are racing. Normally like the Haas, the Williams they seemed to pick up some decent pace through Baku, which we didn't, so, but here is a completely different layout of track, so it's another story, but yeah, we need you to keep pushing and keep working on bringing upgrades. Yeah. Also, it's quite a bit of unfinished business in Baku, you know, two years in a row, not finished the race. But also last year here. I enjoyed my race up to that point. So you're looking forward to hopefully complete the whole race and also fighting for points. Yeah, to be honest, not much to add for my side. Very similar to Lando. Where we’re racing, I think we need the extra DRS zones, to be more following closely, because most of the races being like the DRS trains so far, the last few events, especially for us, try to clamp back on the field is almost impossible, unless somebody makes a major mistake, which doesn't really happen too often, right now in Formula 1. So for my sides, I agree, we need to have a look, because last year, the way we were, there’s team like us, well under the weight limit, and then we gain some advantage, and then it looks maybe too much. But then, yeah, for this year, they gain downforce, more sliding following closely. So I think I'm more happier, obviously, to extend I think, just for better racing, to be honest.",Miami,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Lance Stroll,"No concerts. No baseball games. I mean, it's been great. Hanging out on the beach. And yeah, working on my tan. Yeah, acclimatising!",Miami,thursday,Aston Martin
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah, it's not just all for you, Tom! It's a little bit for everyone. But yeah, we are the American team. It’s one of our three home races and big commercial race for us, obviously, as well. And, yeah, we're putting in the effort. I still have to do some learning, obviously, but it’s better than nothing having done a few laps in a road car last year, which was, you know, good fun on top of that. But of course, you know, you have to explore the track with a Formula 1 car. Some minor changes as well from last year. So look forward to exploring it. It looks quite fun on paper, in the simulator it felt nice too. It’s got a good flow to it. So yeah, looking forward to get out there and get sweaty. Yeah, Baku was a tricky weekend for us, for different reasons. I do believe that here, this track should suit us. It’s going to suit us better. So yeah, I think as everyone knows, the midfield is very tight. We’ve got to pull it all together, make no mistakes, but I believe that if we can all get it together that we can be in the points on Sunday. It was a 10km race. What’s the difference between that and a half-marathon? I don’t know, but the target was sub-40 minutes on 10km, which I've achieved. Pretty much. I was a little bigger when I was young but when my Dad started to invest in me and it got serious, he said, ‘Son, you got to lose some weight.’ And he sent me running and ever since I stuck with it. It's all been said. [to Lando] But Max said you’re the vibe guy! I haven’t raced here, so that’s the wrong one for me! I mean, just look around, when you drive around, for us, from Europe, it’s so different how it looks, how it feels. I mean, where we live, also the weather is pretty good but here, it’s just consistent. The palms, the people, I think also the Latin factor involved here. It's just very unique, different and yeah, it feels like a grand prix weekend but also it feels like a grand prix with a lot of entertainment – or maximum entertainment – and feels special and unique for that reason.",Miami,thursday,Haas
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, they are in another league once it comes to the race. So, the really good lap managed to put us in front, but then over 51 laps it was just not possible. They have so much more pace than we do in race pace. So yeah, as I said yesterday, I think they found something that we didn't yet. And that's where our focus is at the moment. Everybody's working flat out to try and understand what we can do in the races, especially to just get more performance. Honestly, the feeling is a little bit better, but when I see the gap – and I'm pretty sure that when you have this type of gap you're probably not pushing 100% – so yeah, we don't really know how much we have closed the gap. The feeling is a little bit better, but again also the Aston Martin was really quick today. So we still have a lot of work. Yeah, no, he was pushing. I knew what his intentions were at the beginning, because he always does that – trying to keep the tyres at the beginning of the stint and pushing at the end. So I tried to do the same. And at the end, it was close, but not enough for Fernando today. Got closer, maybe a little bit, but still very far behind in race pace at least, and I also think that we also behind Aston Martin in terms of race pace. So, we really need to work on that because for now, over one lap, taking a bit more risk, of course I did also two great laps I think, in Qualifying, which helped us to be in front, but then, over 51 laps race, there is not much we can do more. So today, we've optimised absolutely everything. The thing we should be happy about after a weekend like this is that we've maximised every session. I don't think we could have done anything better in any of those sessions. So that is a positive – but still a lot of work to do in terms of race pace. At the end, it's the same car. I managed it differently but actually the outcome doesn't change, whether I lose time at the beginning because I need to be careful of my tyres, and then I push, I basically lost the time I had lost at the end of the stint yesterday, at the beginning now. So, yeah, I think we've done absolutely everything. We've tried everything, but the bottom line is that we are just not quick enough. Well, we have to with our car otherwise we kill them, and then we cannot get them back and then this has a big influence on our performance. So, I think we did the perfect management today. But again, as I said, we are just not quick enough. Whether we lack at the beginning of the stint, or at the end of the stint, this we can change but yeah, we just don't have enough performance for now. Nothing to add. Yeah, happy is probably not the word. It's good to finally score some points as I've said many times this weekend, I don't think that the six points we had coming here was really representative of our true performance. But of course, we are lacking a lot of performance compared to the Red Bull guys and also to the Astons in the race, but we deserve more points. So it's good to finally have those points. But now we just need to work extremely hard in order to be fighting with those guys again in the race.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think of course, the Safety Car was a bit unlucky, then I had to push again. I tried to stay very close, to try and get into the DRS. But I think the tyres were overheating a bit because of that, of course, trying to follow. But also the balance. I was struggling to be really consistent. So I was playing around with the tools a little bit. And I think once I got that sorted, I would say the last 10 laps were actually quite good again, but just a little bit too late but I think a lot of things learned again throughout the race and, of course, at the end of the day a good team result. I don't know. I mean, we know it's a very long season. And like I said, a lot of things are learned again. I mean, Baku is again, quite different to Miami, and Miami is going to be, again, very different to the other tracks we go to. But yeah, you keep learning, you know. It can never be perfect all the time. I think they're always days that you can learn. Yeah, a few times we hit the wall, around the lap. So we were of course pushing, but that's also part of a street circuit. Well, I think the weekend in general, a bit messy, but I think that can be expected with this format. But the race today, I think the first stint, probably I could have been a little bit more aggressive with the way I was using my tyres. I think I was just too careful. And that's why, you know, Checo was still quite close to me. And then of course, we made the call to pit. I mean, I saw that there was a car stopped, I thought he maybe just locked-up. In hindsight, I mean, I can't see that but yeah, it's something to review. I mean, clearly you could see there was one wheel damaged and it looked like he was not going to drive that anyway back to the pits, even if he would have reversed, so something to look at, because of course that then did hurt my race after that. Then after the Safety Car, I tried to put the pressure on Checo, to try and get into that DRS. I think one time, I was pretty close to getting it. But it was just hanging in there, really close, trying to really catch-up probably damage my tyres a bit too much early on for such a long stint. So, then at one point, I just settled-in, tried to do a little bit my own thing, to not damage the tyres completely to the end. But it was just very difficult to have a good balance, entry to mid-corner. And a lot of the lap time here is about entry-to-mid corner, to get that right. And I was just struggling with oversteer then understeer. So, the whole race, I was just trying a lot of things on my steering wheel to try and get a bit of a better feeling, balance in the car. And I actually think that I found a good compromise towards the end of the race because I think my last 10 laps were a lot stronger. And I felt a lot happier with the car, how everything was behaving. So, I think all in all, I can be quite pleased with second. I mean, of course you always want to win, right? But I think sometimes you need these kinds of weekends to learn and have a better understanding of the car. Of what the car needs to go faster. And sometimes on the street circuit like this, it really comes out. Like, sometimes these kinds of things might get a bit masked on a normal track because of downforce and just the general behaviour of a car. So, maybe this was a good day, you know, to go forward. I don’t know. I mean, these kinds of things, normally you don't really changed a lot from FP1 to FP2, but as maybe just a general operation, or what needs to change to go a little bit faster. I mean, we have these different tyres this year compared to last year, so maybe that influences a bit the behaviour. But, like I said, good learning day. I think our car is pretty quick. I mean, I don't know, I think we finished 20 seconds ahead? I don’t know what it was, something like that. So I think definitely we have the quickest race car. For sure we were pushing but the cars behind us were also pushing. It’s not like they're just relaxing, so yeah, we will of course keep on trying to improve the car because it's still a long season, a lot of different tracks coming up. But I think it was still a positive weekend for us. Yeah, I mean, I could see the car stopping but, I mean, you see it on the screen, you cannot look into detail if every wheel is connected to the car properly. I mean, of course, the team has bit more overview to that. But like I said, we'll look into that if there was anything we could have done different. But I also don't know when the exact call came to pit, right? So yeah, it's difficult to say at the moment. Yeah, like Checo said, I think the more downforce we generate -  and that, of course, will always be every year -  if you keep the rules the same it will be harder to pass. And I think also, because of the weight of the cars we have nowadays, because they're quite heavy, in the low speed it’s a bit harder to follow because as soon as you have a tiny moment with that weight, it becomes a bigger slide, it's harder on the tyres so you overheat the tyres more. And also with these new type of cars, you have to run them super stiff whereas I remember like 2015 or ‘16, you could do it sometimes a few different lines, you could run a kerb because the cars were quite - well, not soft -  but it's still a lot softer than what we run now. And you could do a few different kinds of techniques and lines but that is really, really hard nowadays because the cars just don't allow it. They were not issues. There was not a problem with it. I'm probably operating them a bit differently to Checo. And like I said, maybe I'm not using the correct settings with these new tyres and probably it was a little bit more highlighted on a street circuit where there's a lot of confidence needed on entry to mid-corner and that balance really needs to be as close to perfection basically. So yeah, I was just struggling a lot with that today at the beginning and then I was trying a few things.  Sometimes, of course I didn't get it right but then towards the end I think I found - let's say -  the right settings from entry- to mid- to exit and also the team was helping me a bit and I had a few questions.  So a few things to review for the upcoming races, what we can do better operationally, but again, sometimes you have weekends where you don't need to touch the car, everything is perfect and it's  a rocket ship and we still have a rocket ship but still to fine tune basically so far this year, I think. We clearly have the fastest car at the moment but I've been in this position before and it's about consistency. We all know that.  It's a very long season, a lot of different tracks are coming up I think.  So far this year we have been at tracks which are a bit stop-starty, not the full-on racetracks. There are few really fast corners and fast straights out there, which I probably also seem to enjoy a little bit more. But clearly, you know, Checo this year has really been on it, he's been really performing well and that's great to see. He's feeling more and more confident in the car and for the team as well, we are really enjoying it. And I think Checo and I,  we’re having a good time, and we jumped out of the car… And that's also what is very important:  you need to acknowledge and also appreciate when somebody has done a great job. And that's exactly what happened today. And we will continue fighting for the rest of the season but that's normal, we have done that our whole life. I think that's why we have to make sure that we keep developing really well at the moment. And, you know, when that time comes that you know we are going to feel that penalty, hopefully we still have a big enough gap to compensate. But that's why also now it's very important to score all these kinds of results. Yeah, I was not entirely happy with the balance but also in hindsight, I was probably not pushing it enough initially in some corners. But that should never be the indication that if there is a car stopped to just pit because you know that if there is a safety car, then you lose even more time by then staying out. So like I said, there are a few things to look at but again, I always know that the team tries to do the best thing and maybe just today we got unlucky.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Two and a half! Yeah, it really worked out today for us. We managed to stay in the DRS train and we managed to keep the pressure on Max. Yeah, I think we had better deg on that first stint. I think it was looking good from that side. Then the Safety Car came and bunched everyone up. So it was, again, another race on the Hard tyres. I think it was very close between us. I mean, we pushed to the maximum today. I mean, we both clipped the wall a few times. We were both pushing out there. The way Max pushed me through all the race was really hard, but we managed to keep him under control. Really hard! I had a little bit of luck, especially with that front right, that it didn't blow up. Yeah, it was a great weekend overall, you know. We delivered when we had to. It was a lot of pressure. I felt that with this format it puts a lot of stress on the drivers, on the engineers, the mechanics. So the way we delivered over the weekend was great. Yesterday, we executed a good race. But I think today, the way we pushed each other, Max and myself, pretty much from lap one onwards, once we got Charles, it was basically a race between us from the start to the end. I think that first stint was a big key to my race today. Very intense, you know. The first stint was super intense, just making sure I stayed in that DRS. And then once I was in the DRS, just pushing Max to make sure that he used his tyres and I think that was one of the keys. But then once we were on the Hard compound, it was really hard, you know, to keep Max behind, because I knew that as soon as he would get DRS then that's it, really. So just to keep him behind the DRS was a massive challenge. And we were pushing each other massively. We really gave it all, lap after lap. And I'm really happy to come away with this victory. Yeah, that was key, you know, because once Max got by I knew that it was really important not to lose too much time with Charles, because if I were to lose too much time with Max then it will be really difficult to catch him. Luckily, I managed to spend just a lap behind Charles. And once I was able to clear him then lap by lap I got into the DRS from Max and that really made my race. Once I was in his DRS, it was about time to overtake him, but he obviously pitted. And then we got the Safety Car, so I got a bit lucky there. It actually helped me! I was struggling with the front end, so somehow I picked up a bit of front end. So something to see, but no, in all honesty, I was quite concerned, because the paranoia starts and you start to look at the tyre and I was looking at the tyre and my engineer asked me what happened on 15 and I’m like, ‘wait, I'm just looking that everything is OK with the tyre’, so yeah, it was one of those moments where you drop a bit of concentration and in this place you cannot really, it doesn't matter where you are in the race, you cannot lose your concentration at all. Well, I think it's a long year ahead, you know. I really believe that we are in the fight. I think without the problems we had in the qualifying in Melbourne, we should be a lot closer. So, it's important not to have those problems ever again and to minimise the problems, because I think at the end of the day, it's just very important to make sure that whenever we cannot win, finish second and it's still a good day still. I feel this year certainly has become a little bit harder, because they say that they're collecting the data from last year. But somehow, I feel these cars are generating a bit more downforce and by generating that little more downforce, the car behind struggles a little bit more to follow. So in my opinion, it wasn’t the right thing to shorten up the DRS, because it's getting harder to overtake than last year already in itself so it's something we should review. Yeah, I think there is a very high level of respect between Max and myself, and the whole team. The level we are operating at,  we’re pushing each other really hard, we obviously want to beat each other, I want to win the championship as much as Max wants but there is a lot of respect between us. And I feel in a way, we're very similar in the way we approach or think about the sport so I do not believe he will change.  We will be fighting each other like we did today, as much and as hard as we possibly can. But I think with a very high level of respect to us and to our team. Well, it doesn't really change anything to be honest. As I say, I only regret the problems we had in Melbourne, that really made us lose a lot of points. But other than that, we have to win the races that we can, and when not, we have to score as many points as possible, because if we don't do that, then there is no way that we will be able to fight for the championship. So it's a very long way ahead. There are a lot of races coming up, a lot of different moments, but we have to make sure that when we are able to win a race, we have to make sure we grab it with both hands. Well, I think Jeddah, here, they've been two strong weekends for me when I've been pushed by Max pretty much from beginning to end. Also, I've done very good races like… I remember Singapore was also when I was pushed by Charles extremely hard. I don't know. I wouldn't say this is my best ever race. I think it was just a very, very good race where I pushed from the start to the end without mistakes and I think always when you do that, you believe that you can beat anyone. So it's just about keeping it up throughout the season.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it started really tricky, with Q1, with the amount of red flags that we had there. And then sticking to the same set, you know, you don't want to waste any more sets in Q1. So that was difficult, the warm-up. And just to get through, without making mistakes, without much practice, it was pretty challenging, I think the team has done a great job. I'm a bit disappointed to be sitting in P3, because I felt there was more in it. My lap wasn't that clean. But I mean, if there is a circuit where you can race then it’s definitely here. We knew they were going to be very strong, they're very efficient, so we knew coming here that Ferrari was going to be the biggest threat to us. I think Charles has done a tremendous lap as well. I think in Turn 3 I lost more than a tenth. I went really deep. And yeah, just in general not putting a clean lap, with so many corners around. And there's always a combination if you don't get the, like, one corner right, like Turn 6, then always Turn 7 can be a bit tricky. Five and 6, there is a combination in that corner. So I think all in all, it wasn't a very clean lap. I think certainly, I had more pace than what I've shown today. But I'm still in the fight, you know. I think with this tricky Qualifying and very little time to get ready for Quali, it was just important to make sure that we are in a good position for Sunday. Well, it's much better being P3 than not even making it through Q1. I think I'm getting back my confidence. It really knocked my confidence quite a bit, if I'm honest, what happened in Melbourne, especially with, you know, we had a three-week break and then you go straight into Qualifying pretty much. And it's all about braking here, having that confidence on the barking and I think I'm getting there. Yeah, it was pretty much blind going through to the chicane, through the castle. It was pretty difficult. But I had a reference, so I knew where to stick it. So it worked out alright. Yeah, I think the whole qualifying sessions this year have been really close. And if we were not perfect on Saturday, then you will be just not possible to get pole because the margins were always within a tenth, two-tenths maximum. So, that really requires being perfect, having a good quali session. And today I think we didn't maximise it and the result is that we got beaten by Ferrari. So,  I think no surprises there because qualifying has been extremely tight already this year.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"It's always tough around here, you know, to really put the whole lap together. I think, also, the second one, we tried something different on the lap, which maybe was not ideal for the lap time at the end. But around here it's just really hard, you know. In Q3 you're on the limit and then trying to make everything perfect is not the easiest. But nevertheless, I mean, we're P2. We know that we have a very good race car. So all in all, it's not bad, because you always want to start ahead but we'll have to pass one car. Yeah, looking forward to it, to see what we can do there and maybe we can find a few little things to do better. But overall, it's all about just keeping it clean, you know. It's super easy around here to make a mistake. So that's definitely what we don't want to do. Then we'll see what happens tomorrow. Well, it's not bad. I mean, it's better than last! No, I mean, it's been alright. It's just, it's tough to put the whole lap together around here. And yeah, also, the last run in Q3 was maybe not the cleanest. We also tried a bit of a different out lap. And I didn't really feel it was better. And when you have that feeling already, then you are on your lap, not as confident as the lap before. And I think that's why also the lap time didn't really come out of it. But I mean, at the end of the day, it's also not really bad for us. I mean, we know that we have a quick race car and, yeah, we have to try and of course use that, mainly on Sunday. But first, of course, we'll wait and see what we can do tomorrow. Yeah, it was alright. It was, yeah, fine. You know, you just keep it out of the walls, keep it clean. Well, in qualifying, not so much. I mean, I think the race is a bit different, you know. You cannot attack like you do in qualifying, and also the way the car behaves on the tyres is completely different. So, you know, on street circuits like this, I think qualifying and the race are quite different. Not really of Charles. I mean, we know that he's been really good around here. Otherwise you don't get three poles in a row, right? So, yeah, he felt good today, he had a lot of confidence. I think he always has a lot of confidence, which is good. And then around here, you know, you really get everything out of it. And that's why he put it on pole. Not so much. I mean, I felt quite good in FP1 with the little long run we did. So I think we'll learn a little bit more tomorrow during the Sprint race, which probably gives you even more of an idea for Sunday? Yeah, I was just trying to put a bit more temperature in them. It was just, you know, after FP1, I think sometimes you're not fully understanding what you want to do in Qualifying. And I mean, the first run was good, but it was still not perfect. So we tried, and I mean, it could have worked and then it looks amazing and that's a bit what happened in Australia. And this time, I guess it didn't work. But it’s not the end of the world. No, I don't think so. But if you look at all the qualifyings, I mean, I think, in general, it's been quite close, the first three rounds. We have a really good race car, I think, but it's never really been, let’s say,  super-dominant over one lap. I don't know why that is. It was the same last year, of course, it was also a bit down to being overweight. But then at one point we started to trim that down and it was still not our, let's say, best day on the Saturday. So, sometimes just the way the car works – but of course we all know that the points are on Sunday, so I don't mind if it's a little bit slower on Saturday and quick on Sunday. Or whatever – I’ve lost it with the formats now. Can I say that?  Quick on Sunday, Saturday?",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"For sure, I'm surprised. I mean, we came into the weekend thinking that it would be a great weekend if we are in front of Aston and Mercedes in qualifying and in the end we are on pole,  so it's a really good surprise. We must not forget that our race pace maybe still behind the Red Bulls, so it's going to be difficult to keep the lead, but that's the target. I’m really, really happy with the lap. I mean, it's a very challenging weekend overall for us drivers, because we had very little time to practice. We only had one FP1 and then you need to be straight on it, but the feeling was good since the start so I was really, really happy. It's going to be challenging because we haven't run the Medium yet. So, tomorrow in qualifying will be the first time, and we need to be on it because we only have one set, so no room for mistakes. But again the pace seems strong, so hopefully we can learn in SQ1 and SQ2 and then push in SQ3 and there we know the car is good. Really good, especially considering the beginning of the season I’ve had. I mean, obviously, we haven't had the greatest of beginnings. But it's great to be back on pole. Honestly, I did not expect it. I think we came into the weekend thinking that it would be a great result if we were in front of the Astons and the Mercedes, and we find ourselves on pole. So really, really happy with that. We need to see obviously tomorrow for the Sprint race and for the race on Sunday, as I think we are a little bit more on the back foot there. But anyway, a really good surprise and extremely happy with my lap. Well, I think on street circuits, you always try and do one lap in Q3, pushing obviously more than any other laps before. But then for the last attempt you just put everything in and see how it goes. So it was a close call in Turn 1. But overall it was quite a clean lap and yeah, again, really happy with the lap. I felt like whenever you have the excitement of pole, you want to say yes. But it was definitely a really, really good one. Whether it was the best or not, I don't know. I remember in ’21 here, it was also a pretty good lap and I think it was even more of a surprise. But it was definitely a really, really good lap. Quite a lot. But I was surprised in FP1 with the grip there was. I think the new tarmac helped it a little bit and the grip was good. Then there's, of course, a lot of track evolution, a lot of driver evolution, especially on a track like this, but it was much better than what I thought. For the second question, I hope so. I don't have the answer yet. But one thing for sure is that I think we did a step forward in Australia. On my side obviously I couldn't show it. But on Carlos’ side, I think the feeling was much better during the race. Then how much better, we still need to see on Sunday. So I think on that we still have some question marks. But I am absolutely sure that we did some steps in the right direction. I’m not sure whether it's enough, though. I mean, it's good. It feels good. I think the whole team needed it, because we arrived here where… It's part of our job in teams in Formula 1 you need to deal with rumours and pressure, but it's obviously sometimes a bit more difficult to perform under those circumstances and we did really well. So, I think it's good for the whole team. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it works well for me here. There's been also years where it worked less well in Qualifying also. But yeah, I don't know. I love street tracks in general, not only here, but Singapore, Monaco. These are probably my three favourite tracks of the season. So, I enjoy this challenge of pushing the limits but you cannot go over it obviously otherwise you pay the price of it. So, this is something I enjoy then. It's not like I do anything particular that I can pinpoint for being so quick in street tracks. I think we realised it already from testing, which was not easy, but at least it helped us for a week to basically understand that we probably wouldn't be fighting with Red Bull, at least in the first part of the season. So, we were aware that we just had to take the maximum points possible in those difficult races. Unfortunately for me, we've been pretty unlucky in the first two races and then the incident with Lance in the last one. So very, very few points. But yeah, I just hope this weekend can be a clean one that we can get the points we deserve. And yeah, then we'll see. We know that for now in terms of race pace, we are a bit behind but, as I said, our job is to maximise the points in those situation for later in the season, if we are strong enough, go and get the wins.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, I'm really fond of the April break. I had three weeks, it was really nice. Definitely it felt long in terms of like the race side, but actually I still relaxed a lot and recharged myself. Still definitely did training and also had an extra two days in Australia, which was good after the Melbourne Grand Prix. And yeah, just now, I feel more ready compared to even the last three races. So looking forward to the races ahead. Yeah, it was really surprising news for me. I had, like, lunch with him, like, five days before the news or something like that. And actually he didn't mention about those things. So yeah, I was surprised. At the same time, kind of, there was already kinds of rumours from the beginning of the season. So it actually it came true that he's stepping down. But still, there's 19 races to go to make him happy. Hopefully we can end the season in a positive way for him. To do that, obviously, we need a lot of development we need to do but yeah, we have an aggressive plan to do it. And looking forward to it. And at the same time feeling really kind of appreciative to him that he trusted my speed the last three years. And he was always supportive next to me. So yeah, I’ll try to make it up for him the next races. In terms of confidence, quite similar as the last three races. But I would say last two years when we see, based on the last two years with AlphaTauri is always having a quite good performance here. So I think the track itself maybe suits us more compared to the last three races hopefully. So yes, still feeling optimistic. Still will be difficult to score points but anything can happen here, especially with the new sprint qualifying format, so excited. Yeah, I agree with the drivers. It's definitely exciting. Especially Saturday, just when you wake up and have breakfast, and you’re straight into Qualifying, which is like, you have to really wake for Qualifying. So it's really exciting. And yeah, I can’t wait. Yeah, same as the drivers and especially like Lando said, we still have a budget cap and lots of things we have to develop through the year. So yeah, still, we have to make the car back home safely but at the same time we are going to be aggressive as much as possible. Yeah, I saw that, and yeah, but to be honest, I'm really focusing on what we have now in the AlphaTauri. I think there's still a lot of things to work on. Obviously, I'm happy to hear from him, especially positive things, I guess. I mean, being a Formula 1 driver, you have to be ready, always, when you have the call from a top team. We have to be ready. I think, in the end, everyone’s ready, just how much we can extract from yourself, every race. So, I’m feeling ready, but at the same time, first of all, I need to improve myself more. And I know the current clear target for this year as a team, and also for myself. So, continue this momentum, like I have the last three races, probably even more. And first of all, I just want to make him happy at the end of the season. To say thank you to him and, at the same time, definitely we want to finish in a positive way definitely even compared last year. Oh, yes, it will be nice. I think most of the teams or you know, ourselves last year anyway, we're putting extra engine, and always someone have to start from behind. So, it just definitely makes sense to increase the amount of engines we can use in the year. So, I think it's a good thing for everyone, I think.",Azerbaijan,thursday,RB
Kevin Magnussen,"No, he didn't give me a copy. So, I'll see if I get time to read it. Has he done it? OK. Himself? With his voice? OK. He has a lot of time. Yeah, cool. Well, I mean, last year, we were going pretty well and we didn't have a low downforce configuration for last season. So, we do this year, and hopefully that's going to be making a difference. I think we were pretty quick. But actually I was stuck behind Esteban for quite a while and couldn't get past him, there was no chance. So, hopefully we can at least be a bit more racy and competitive. If we have the pace we can pass people. But it's a very competitive midfield at the moment, very tight. And you know, it's hard to know where you're going to be, but I have a good feeling. Yeah, I think so. There's been… I think we've found it for qualifying and the race, or all of the three weekends we've had so far, but we haven't started off in in the right place with the set-up and then, you know, you lose, you lack a little bit of confidence, because if you start in FP1 pretty close to what you're going to run in qualifying, you get a lot of laps with that car and that balance and you can optimise your driving style around that and it's never optimum going into qualifying with a different set-up, a new set-up you haven't tried. So I think that's the target for us: to hit the ground running a little closer to what we are going to run in qualifying and the race and hopefully that's going to be a step forward for us. I think it's exciting. You know, it will be only FP1 where you’re sort of just driving around and then all the other sessions there's pressure on and it's more exciting, I would say. It's going to be even more important to hit the ground running in FP1. You're not going to make big changes from FP1 to Quali. So it's a bigger challenge, but it's the same for everyone. So I feel it's exciting. I’m looking forward to it. Yeah, I agree with most of what's been said. I mean, it's more exciting. There's more stuff happening. Not that a normal weekend is boring in any way but there's a lot of running that doesn't count for anything. And having most of the sessions in the weekend counting for something I think is cool. Yeah, I don't think you’re going to just pit if you're not in contention for points, but I think if you're P9 towards the end of the race and there is an opportunity to attack, but it might be a slightly risky one, you're going to be more likely to go for it with how it is now. So I think that's an improvement. It's not going to change the world. Sure. Good thing.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Haas
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, I mean, it was definitely a racing incident. It was a tricky restart I think for everyone. But yeah, as I said, I think we debriefed it completely and, you know, there's no issues or kind of things of that sort. So, you know, it could have been anyone, really, in that incident, looking at that Turn 2 in Australia. But yeah, just looking at what could have been. It could have been definitely a good result for the team. We had good pace in the race. And, yeah, that's obviously very encouraging. So, we’ve got some updates here. Some new bits. The guys have been working flat out. First, to repair the cars during these three weeks’ break, so yeah, big, big thanks to them for doing all that. And obviously, they were coming with some new parts. So yeah, it’s exciting. Yeah, it's always great to have new parts on the car. And last year it was one of our strengths. Each time we were putting something new we were gaining, definitely, a good chunk of performance. So, you know, it's exciting times. There's a lot more stuff coming as well, later on. And, especially on a week like that, where we're racing constantly and it's a big weekend for points, hopefully, it's going to deliver and I'm looking forward to it, can't wait to see what it gives us. Yeah, I mean, we'll see. But obviously, you know, there are more opportunities than in 2017, so, I think we always had a car to be able to score points here. And we've always been, you know, quite fast in some areas, and we had… We know where the weaknesses were in the last couple years. So, you know, hopefully we'll start in FP1 and we'll have great surprises. So let's see. No, I agree with Lando, in the regard that it's exciting. You know, it's cool to have more racing, a more exciting weekend, but maybe not every weekend. That would be something to look out for. On the other hand, I think as a driver, it's great that you go straight into that Qualifying Sprint, that Shootout Qualifying without practice before. Because that could bring some uncertainty. Some drivers are not going to be, you know, awake, they are going to make mistakes, and it's not going to be the same. So we'll see. That brings opportunities and brings, you know, skills to the driver more importantly, so I look forward to that. It depends on the situation obviously If there isn't really anything to fight for… But that's not how we are going into the weekend. We're going to try to push as far forward as we can. Testing things? Well, you can't really. If you box, you can’t change the set-up after the first Qualifying. So no, I think keeping on going, getting the knowledge is probably the best thing to do. No, I mean, these things should not have happened at the first place. I mean as I said, it could have been with any other drivers that it could have happened. You know, there were cars spinning on the right; cars going off on the left. And it was a restart for one lap. So everything could have been won or lost. And unfortunately we lost a lot in that one. But no, I mean, we're both very sensible. And we know what we're doing. I think it's been good in the past for Alpine and for myself, the sprint race, so I don't see it that way. I see it as a good thing.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Alpine
Lando Norris,"Yes and no, no. Nope. Of course, I watched it. Silly question. But yeah, just enjoyed a nice few weeks away. Went back for Easter to see my family in Glastonbury and just the rest was spending some time with some friends between the UK and Monaco but yes, I watched the Masters. Watched the whole thing. Of course it could be Tiger’s last one, so cool to see him. Sad to see him withdraw, but hats off to John, to take it away as well. But yeah, apart from that, just enjoying the time away, some sunshine and making sure we're ready for the next decent amount of races. I don't want to get ahead of myself. I think Australia was definitely a better weekend for us, things definitely went our way a little bit more. I think we were unlucky, which made things look worse than they were in the first few races. We do have the upgrade. I think that was made clear and obvious very early on in the season. But what we have now is where we wanted to start the year, you know. It’s what we should have started the year with. So, like, Esteban said, a lot of upgrades and a lot of other teams also have upgrades. So our job is to try and bring slightly bigger things and try to play a little bit of catch-up. I think what we have this weekend is just the baseline we should have started the year with, and it's about understanding what we have now. It's a better baseline. There’s more room for opportunities and more room for improvements with what we have. So yeah, it's definitely going to make us take a small step forward. But to other people also bringing upgrades it's going to be slightly smaller. So, yeah, I'm excited. The team did a very good job to bring these things through and to get them ready. But it's about maximising what we have now. I would expect so. You know, there's still a budget cap. So you know, you want to damage the car in any way. You don't do anything silly. Especially for us, when we're wanting to improve the car as much as possible, the least amount of damage we can cause, the better. But I'm excited. I think it's a better format. I prefer it a long way compared to what we had before. So you have more room, more opportunities for everyone. I like the fact that you have two qualifyings. I love the format of practice, qualifying on Friday. So the pressure is definitely higher. But yeah, I enjoy it more. I mean, top eight cars, most likely. Alpine were very, very quick in Australia, too. So I'm expecting it. Maybe there will be some little changes here and there. But the majority will be pretty similar. I think the revised structure for it, I prefer. I don't want to have a Sprint race every single weekend. I think it's still important to have what we've had for many years. I think that's what makes Formula 1 exciting and cool. I love just having the Saturday Quali and the Sunday race. But I think every now and then having the Sprint races is good for the fans, good for the people watching. I think it’s exciting to change things every now and a little bit for us. But a better structure of doing that. I think having it separate to Sunday, kind of having Saturday on its own, is a good thing. So yeah, I'm excited, I think it should make for a better weekend altogether. No, I mean it’s still a race, there’s still points and you never know when a Safety Car can come out and things can happen. Points only up to eighth, so a bit harder for some of the midfield cars maybe to get into achieving something. But yes, Sunday is still the main day for us. I think for everyone. So it’s still a race at the end of day, so I don't think you'd ever give up, it’s just doing the best you can. I mean, I needed it. I lost my first engine in Round 1. So, nice thing for me. Bit of a disadvantage still but at the same time, yeah, definitely for me a nice thing. So I'm happy with it.",Azerbaijan,thursday,McLaren
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, a really good break. It felt nice to spend some time with family, with friends after these intense first three races. And yeah now looking forward to the rest of the year, and looking forward to coming back to Baku. It obviously stays in the back of your mind. But you have to reset yourself and move on from that. I think there were many specific issues that we had, all that day. It was a horrible day that Saturday, FP3 and Quali, really bad. But I think we understood a lot of the problems that we had. It was not just a single problem that would be really easy just to get rid of. It was a combination of a few things that caused us to have these problems. So hopefully, we don't get to see that again. You don't want to see that, especially here in Baku. Yes, certainly, of course, when you are in a strong position, you just want to keep going and don't let others close up the gap. But of course, everyone is working flat out. And we are also doing the same. So, we're not taking anything for granted. Hopefully we’re bringing some upgrades here. And hopefully we are able to keep on top. I think we have to remain open. Let's see how it goes. I just feel like there are places where you can bring this Sprint format. Baku, normally, generally, the racing is great just with the standard format, so probably there are races where we need to be more selective with the races where we need to improve things. But yeah, let's see. I really don't have a strong opinion. I think it puts a lot of emphasis to be strong, to have a very solid FP1 and then from that onwards we'll see. Every session becomes really important. But yeah, at the end of the day, I think Sunday is the priority for everyone. I will go first, no problem. I think it's a balance. I think someone mentioned earlier about the budget cap. None of us want to make any damage to our cars, because that can be very penalising on bringing future upgrades and it can have an impact on your future races. So, I think it's not like everyone is going to be taking silly risks for a few points. At the end of the day, it’s important to be able to bring the car home and have a good Sunday. So I think it’s not going to change that much. That's what I hear from my engineers. I think we are very transparent within the team. And that was the feedback that I had, and I think sometimes yeah, everyone hears different versions, but at the time, I mean, we’ve always been transparent and that's the main version and the main thing that happened on Saturday, I think our straightline speed should be one of our strengths. It will be very interesting, though, to look at how the new tarmac is. To see if that changes at all. Because just having FP1 to pick up the right downforce level, will be one of the keys, you know? Because I think that will really make things up on Sunday. If you're able to have the right downforce level, and be good through the straights, but also being good and looking after your tyres. That will be the main thing. Well, I think what you've done in the past doesn't really matter. Every weekend it's a new challenge. And we come here to Baku and the challenge is even greater with just FP1 and then straight into Qualifying. I think on the street circuit it is important first to finish and normally if you're able to finish then there's always a good result ahead of you. So, I think just making sure, Baku is always very easy to make mistakes and finish your weekend. So, I think that will be priority number one, to finish the races – both races – and yeah to build that confidence in FP1 will be key. Well, I enjoy this place, certainly. I've had good races, good cars as well, that has helped me in the past. Those days with Force India, we even made it to the podium and also in Qualifying, we were strong. I think it's a circuit that really suits my style and that has helped me to shine a bit more in this place. I think we'll see! Hopefully, my style is the same and it will suit me on the weekend, you know, because as I say, always, you’re finding different challenges. And I think adapting to it, making sure you're able to get a good rhythm on the braking in Baku, it’s key. Well, I think it definitely brings things closer because you don't have that much preparation where it will be easier, let's say, to exploit your potential. I think just having FP1, if things are not solid, already from FP1, you won't be able to exploit your capacity of the car. So, I think certainly it brings everyone a lot closer.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon, everyone. I'm doing great. Really happy to be back in Baku. Strange to have that break only after the first three races but it was great to spend… I love being in Australia, Australia was a great race for us. But then to spend a bit time with family, get back to the factory, work at the factory, then some time with friends and just kind of unplug for a little bit, which is great. And then my brother, who I'm incredibly proud of, continues to be such a great voice, every year he raises his own money because obviously, racing in a series and in a sport where there is no access for people who particularly are disabled. And he stands for so much. And yeah, it's been difficult. He's been fighting to try and make up for the disability he has with his legs, and it's a continuous fight. But he got sixth in the race. And I was just standing in the crowd just watching this as a fan. I was so excited. And no one knew that I was there. I was just jumping up and down and trying to support him. So yeah, very proud and excited for this weekend. The weather was perfect. He pitted on the first lap. And so everyone else was on slicks, and then he made up. Well, James has always been a part of the team, obviously was focused a little bit on another area before. I think having him step back in a little bit to support and work alongside Mike, I think it’s only going to strengthen the team moving forwards. And he's obviously got an amazing amount of experience. So, I think moving forwards, I think it's just going to be great for the team. Particularly with all the things we want to achieve, not only on track, but off track. I think it's going to be good. I’m as confident as I can be, I guess. A lot of work has been done in the background. I think the last race was really, really great for us; we worked really hard to get that sort of result. It won't be easy to do again. We know that Ferrari will be quick, the Red Bulls will be quick, Astons will be quick as well. So I hope that we're just in the mix. I hope that we get to battle with them. This is an amazing event for us to do that. And particularly with the shakeup of the whole format of the weekend. It's probably the most exciting weekend so far this year, and I'm looking forward to seeing how it turns out. Absolutely. Yeah, I think it is going to be tough for everybody. But we're all in the same boat. And you know, what a track to be able to do it at, where overtaking is possible. It's great racing here. We always have mostly the best races here. And so yeah, it's definitely difficult to just have one session where you probably get, like, 20 laps, and then straightaway, you’re into Qualifying. But, that’s what we’re here to do, right? I think it will be an upgrade, naturally, but I think it will be the start of a new path for us. It will be, at the core, still the same car, but part of the path to getting it to where we want to be, so we're not going to hit the ground and be where we wanted to be at the start of the season. We're not making up that crazy ground that there is but I think it's really positive. So much great work has been done back in the factory to… it takes time to progress in the right direction, so I'm excited for it. I don't think it makes really a lot of difference now. Obviously before, where you finished in the sprint was where you obviously qualified for the race. Now it is a practice session but there are points at the end of it, I guess. I don't think we'll be going more out than we normally have done in the past. What I do think is - and I think it's great that we are doing these different format weekends - but there's a lot of time where we could do more running. And I know we always talk about what's the best in terms of environment and all those sorts of things but I don't know if it'd be better for the fans but there's a lot of… there's a huge break between these sessions and we could be doing more running or whatever it may be. If that was better for the fans, for example, so maybe we'll look into that in the future. I can't speak for Fernando but you can tell, obviously, from looking from afar and how Fernando is driving, the talent clearly hasn't left him and I don't believe it does leave us. I think it's also to do with your work ethic. He's clearly in great shape, and he’s doing an amazing job. I think racing is really enough in our DNA, in our blood and we don't put less work in now than we did when we were younger. I think there's more information out there, how to be fit and healthy. You see it with the greats like LeBron and Tom Brady. And so I think there's probably even more focus nowadays than ever before from an athlete’s perspective and how to get absolutely everything out of your mind and your body and yeah, still hungry as ever, and clearly Fernando is too. No, not really. I think maybe some of the drivers will speak or have relationships with different bosses and stuff. No, I like where I am, I love my team and I think I'm grateful for the journey we've been on and what we’re working on moving forward so… doesn't have any impact, no.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"That’s why we’re here! We come all the way to Baku and another 23 to do! Well, another 20. But yeah. I think the format is a bit different to last year. So it will create a bit of a different weekend format to us, a bit of a different approach. But in the end, we're racing, every lap that we will do will be competitive like always, so I welcome it. Saturday… so what do we have in Saturday! We have the Shootout Quali. That will be difficult, especially waking up in the morning and going straight into Q1. That will be like… I need to do a good warm up, maybe a cold shower, make sure I'm really woken up for pushing flat-out in one of these cars, bumpy cars on the straight first thing in the morning. I'll make sure I do my morning routine well because it will be intense. And then the Sprint Quali – still called Sprint Quali, yeah? I think it's going to be fun. The Sprint, sorry. 17 laps. Exciting, I think. More racing. More important laps in the weekend, obviously tougher, both mentally and physically for us – but if it makes the fans happy and the media happy and makes the product better, we will do it. We do know our car much better, especially after these three weeks. We've managed to put together some good analysis and good directions set for the future, to chase in our development programme. This was  target number one of this three-week break, to really identify the weaknesses that we have. The strengths of our direct competitor, in this case Red Bull, that is a clear step in front of everyone, and we try the best we can to come back to fighting them as quickly as possible. Our chances this weekend should be similar to the chances in Australia. It is true that in Australia, we took a bit of a different path on setup that seemed to work. We were quite quick in the race, where in the past we've struggled. So, I hope that we can keep going in that direction and feel more competitive this weekend again. Well, personally, because I can only talk from my personal experience, I think he's a great guy, very valid, very strong figure. He's taking a step up in his career, so I can only be happy for him. I think obviously when you're offered such an important role, I think you have to take it. But yeah, we are also hiring staff, is not like we are only losing no? We're doing the best to restructure our team, to make it stronger. And I'm sure there's going to be people coming, people arriving to compensate for the last few losses that we have. It’s just that maybe sometimes the losses are quicker than what you managed to get people back . But I'm quite confident with Fred’s approach to the management and the way it's being handled because I see good things coming. Masters winner! I'm actually playing Augusta in a couple of weeks. I am so excited. I wish it was with Jon! One day, maybe. But it was an amazing achievement. I think he's become one of the mentally strongest sportsmen out there today. Number one in the world. The way that he has managed to play this season is amazing. And I have a lot of respect for him. I had the pleasure to meet him and I actually have a collaboration sponsor the same as him, so I will meet him more during the year. Yeah, obviously a lot of respect for Franz. He's been part of that team for a long time and there's so many young drivers that have been part of, at the time Toro Rosso now AlphaTauri, and he's helped all of us to become better drivers, better professionals, better persons for sure. So I wish him all the best for the future and I hope to see him around in the near future back in F1. Personally, I've prepared the race as a normal race and the long run, you have to believe the simulations. The data that comes out of the sprint qualifying is also important for the main race; let's not forget that the main race is still the one that gives out the most points and I guess that sprint race will give us a lot of information going into the main race. There was a song. There was a song about you. I agree. I still don't think it will be like we need to or be in it for us, it will be still important laps, important points for the championship. Important learning for the main race so I don't think an F1 driver will change massively the approach to the start, to the fighting. We will still approach it as a normal race and I'm trying to think something else to tell you but that’s it. I don't think it will change our approach much.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Ferrari
Valtteri Bottas,"I do. I like the fact that it's straight into action – just one practice but it becomes obviously more and more valuable and everyday has a session that really, really matters. Saturday is a proper day – but as Carlos said, it’s definitely more demanding mentally. Maybe even physically. Because here you need to be switched on for the whole weekend. You can't just you know, take the Friday is in the normal practice day, but I think it's good. Three very different type of grands prix, some of them we had some issues. Good thing is that there's still 20 races to go, which is a lot. And actually, we welcomed this mini-break, let's say, to try and understand, figure out how can we, you know, find those, those gains that we're looking for. But it's so competitive at the moment, like if you're a bit off the pace with the car whatsoever, it’s many, many places. And it's a tight mix. But again, very different track. You need a really efficient car here, aero-wise. See where we are but yeah, we've been working a lot and done lots of work in the sim as well, since the last race and definitely understood a few things. Yeah, absolutely. It's good. It's good. And the simulation tools, they are always improving but already on a good level. So yeah, we have some things in the pipeline, which I hope it will help us with. I think it's a combination of simulations, experience gathered in the past years, gut feeling, different calculations and whatever feedback we can give as drivers after FP1 from the laps we do, and the tyre wear numbers that we see; all these things are just taken into consideration. And then you need to make a plan based on those and hope it goes right. So obviously, there's lots of preparation done before the weekend already and we kind of have an idea, but we need to confirm those things in practice. So yeah, definitely, you need to get it right. And it's not easy. It's a good question. Ah, that one, yes. Okay. Now, I got it. So you were asking me when there's going to be a book? Maybe one day. I have some good stories that have happened to me throughout my career so far, and hopefully many good stories to come. But I haven't set a date yet but maybe eventually I'll do something. Good to hear. Can do, if it helps. Good idea. I think it's like, for example, if I would be on the last laps in ninth position, which is just outside of the points in the sprint, then definitely you go for it. Obviously, if you break your car or something, then that could have consequences for Sunday. But then on another case, there's not a huge difference, but I think a welcome one. So at least you know that you can try and if you're just on the edge of the points. And to your question, you're like 15th or something, you still go for it, it's the nature of us. You don't give up and in this sport you never know what happens so you go ‘till the end.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, I think it's exciting for everybody, keeps everyone on their toes all weekend. Like the guys have said, there’s not much time to get into the groove and get the car in a happy place, where you want it. So I think it's fun. It's going to be exciting for the fans too, which is great. I do remember it. I remember being second for like 27 laps and then losing it in the last metre of the race. Yeah, time goes by quickly, it’s already six, seven years ago, but great memories here. A track that's a lot of fun to drive, really challenging and always offers great racing, good overtaking opportunities and that makes it a lot of fun. Yeah, it's been a great start to the season for us. Another good result in Melbourne, third and fourth. I think we've definitely seen on different kinds of tracks – Bahrain being a very different kind of track to Saudi and again, in Melbourne, we were pretty competitive at all those events. And coming here again, it's a very different kind of track to Melbourne, to Jeddah, the last couple. So we'll see where we sit, but I don't think there's any reason why we can’t be competitive again this weekend. I thought Valtteri’s summary was very good. I don't think I could have really said it better. It's tricky, there's not a lot of time to… like I said before, to get everything right. So it's just… with what you're able to do with one practice session, trying to put it all together. I think you'd never know what happens. You could be 14th or 15th, and two laps to go, three laps to go, the safety car comes out and something like that and that can give you an opportunity to fit new tyres, whatever, and score points. So I don't think that changes the mindset as a driver. Just never give up ‘till the chequered flag.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Aston Martin
Alex Albon,"Yeah, especially for midfield teams there's a bit more going on. And I think on Friday, there's maybe some teams that won't get it perfect and that's good for us. I think it creates opportunity for some others to get on the pace early and I think we welcome that. It's a good change from the original Sprint race format, where obviously it would sometimes filter out the differences in qualifying. This is a good way to do it. Along with Monza and these kind of circuits, it does have that aero efficiency that suits us but these corners, these almost repetitive 90 degree, third-gear corners… I wouldn't say low speed is necessarily our strength. So it's going to be a mix. We're obviously hopefully going to be quite good down the straights, but it's more or less about minimising as little an amount of time through the corners so let's see. No, I wouldn't say so. I'm trying to think when we scored a point last year? Melbourne. It is true, I think obviously we had, again, a very strong showing in Melbourne. We had a really good race. We had a brake failure in Jeddah, we had a human error in Melbourne, but I think if you look at how we've gone about this year, we've made some great steps forward. Melbourne, we were generally the best of the rest outside of the top four teams, so it's looking on the up and I think the motivation and the energy in the team is very positive. It's exciting to be back in the fight and to be able to fight some midfield teams. I do think some of the races earlier in the year have suited our car a bit more; the circuits tend to suit us. Hopefully the same here in Baku. So we just need to make the most of the opportunity. And I think there are a few teams now bringing some upgrades soon, already in Baku some of the midfield teams are, so it's going to be a development race. But for now we're well in the mix and it's nice to be there. No, nothing major so kind of seeing how our rivals improve and looking around us a little bit. I like Franz a lot as a person. He was a true kind of racer. I felt like he was very technical in his approach and I think as he had so many rookies coming into the team, he definitely had an understanding for what it took. And my first… I spent six months more or less in the team at the time, he really got me to understand what it takes to be an F1 driver and almost get prepared for it, because I think coming from F2 you never really understand what you're in for. But he's obviously had that experience with a lot of people, a lot of drivers. I enjoyed my time and I wish him all the best in his... I don't know what he's going to do afterwards, I don't know if he’s said, I don't know if it's retirement or not. Enjoy going skiing. Yeah, I think everyone's kind of said what is the feeling, basically. The only thing I'd add is that there are four teams now that kind of regularly score points, and it's the top eight that do score points in the sprint race, so it's going to be one of those situations where I think you're going to get quite a repetitive order in that sprint race: the same people scoring points. Maybe, if anything, I think they're racing each other anyway but there is a… I think there is that kind of divide between the midfield and the top end. Already, in the normal races, most of the positions are fought… ninth and tenth. I think it's been a big battle in the midfield - a good one - and that's been those positions and of course, you capitalise when there's the DNF or to get eighth or seventh, let’s say, whereas now we need a bit more than that. I think it's going to be tricky to get into the points for a sprint race.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Williams
Fernando Alonso,"Probably not. I mean, we had a roller coaster of emotions today. And yeah, many things going on at the beginning. But then also at the end now, you know, the last half an hour it was difficult to understand what's going on. But the race itself was good for us in terms of pace. I think Mercedes were very fast and Lewis did an incredible job today, so I could not match the pace or not get close enough. But we take P3. Yeah, I mean, the first red flag did help us, because George and Carlos came in. So we took those places for free. And the second red flag probably didn't help, obviously, with the incident there. But then we got lucky again and we had another opportunity now to just see the chequered flag in P3 and as I said, P3, P4 for the team is just amazing Sunday. I guess a little bit higher up on the podium, because three third places, let's go for a second place at least. Yeah, very. I mean, incredible. And also for the team, third and fourth, 27 points out of this Sunday, I think. It really made me feel happy for the boys and girls in the team. And yeah, the race was not easy. For sure. I think at the beginning obviously we got lucky with the first red flag because George, and Carlos pitted, so we benefit from that, and then yeah, in terms of pace we were very close to Lewis, also through the race – but every time that I tried to get close, yes he seemed to pick up the pace. I try to put some pressure but, you know, he had an incredible race, no mistakes at all, as you probably expect from him, a champion. But only one lock-up, I think, Turn 13, in 58 laps. So I was trying to put pressure but nothing happened. So yeah, I will take P3. They were good. Probably. I think when you do 50 laps within two seconds of the car in front, it’s normally you have a little bit more. If you have a little bit of clean air, probably you can get two or three tenths out of that lap time. But in the other end, I could not get any closer than that. So, I think we were very similar. Yeah, I mean, obviously I didn't know who touched me in that moment. I just felt in Lap One of the first start, someone touched me in Turn 3. And then in the last restart, Carlos apparently touched me in Turn 1. Yeah, I mean probably only Jeddah I had the normal start. In Bahrain also in Turn 4, Lance touched me, into T4, so, I'm very attractive out there! But our car is strong enough. So you know, it doesn't matter if they keep touching us. Yeah, I mean, probably the penalty is too harsh, I think because on Lap One, it is very difficult always to judge what the grip level, and I think we don't go intentionally into another car, you know? Because we know that we risk also our car and our final position, so sometimes you ended up in places that you wish you were not there in that moment. And it's just part of racing, but I didn't see the replay properly, but for me, it feels to hard. Yeah, similar comments. I think, at the beginning of the second race, let's say, there were some doubts that the tyre could make that distance, because we missed FP2 long runs and everything. But I agree that at the end of the race, the tyres were better than expected. They could keep going. Yes, similar comments. For us, it's just an opportunity, so yeah, I was pretty sure that I could be second, to be honest, in the last start, because we've been very good, very strong on the starts and it was good again, I was side-by-side into Turn 1. But then yeah, you also sometimes realise that there are a lot of risks as well, every time there is this kind of restart, and maybe you end up with a DNF, which was very close for me this time. You never know. I was surprised with all the red flags, to be honest, because the first one, I think, was [because of] a Williams in Turn 6, but we went through there one lap, I think, behind the Safety Car and there was a little bit of gravel, but nothing really too bad on track. But we never know in the car what's going on on the track itself. So apparently, maybe one barrier was not properly fit there, so I think the FIA has more information than us. So if there is a red flag, it has to be for a reason. We will ask probably in Baku what was the reason for the second? I know there was a piece of tyre debris in the first straight but the car itself was on the inside of Turn 4 so it felt quite safe there. And the safety car is for those kind of reasons so yeah, for us, maybe it was a different opinion. But as I said the FIA are the only ones that have all the cards on the table so in those kinds of situations, we trust them, and we try to keep them going. No more three Red Bulls on the podium, if Checo was here! But no, I think Mercedes they've been also strong in Jeddah, to be honest. I think all the race on Sunday, I was within one tenth of George, fighting to get this extra five seconds or whatever at the end so it was very, very close. It seems that qualifying is quite important now, because race pace is very similar and I think now we enter into a part of the season that is going to be very interesting: which team is developing the car faster? I think the first three races being away from Europe, it’s difficult to bring upgrades and things like that. But from now on, maybe we see the level of the teams changing a little bit, race-by-race, depending on who brings an upgrade that is good enough. I don't know, for us, it's all happy days at the moment. We never expected to be on the podium, maybe even throughout the season and in three races we have three. So everything that comes now is a plus and as I said today, third and fourth is a lot of points so we take every opportunity and we need to learn and we need to grow as a team also maybe now off-track because we are racing against Red Bull, Mercedes, Ferrari, teams that are used to this kind of pace of development and things like that. And maybe we are just in a learning process. So we take this 2023 in a very humble manner and let’s see how it's going.",Australia,post-race,Aston Martin
Lewis Hamilton,"It was! I’ve got to say a huge thank you to everyone here in Australia and Melbourne for having [us]. I've had the best week here, this week. And the weather has been amazing today and this track, this town continues to put on a great show. So yeah, it’s very unlucky for George today and on our side we’ve got to look into… Our reliability has generally been really good, so that's really unfortunate. But otherwise, to get those points is really amazing today. I definitely didn't expect to be second. So I'm super grateful for it. Yeah, I still feel uncomfortable in the car, though. The car… I still don't feel connected to it. So I'm driving as best I can with that disconnect. And I'm working as hard as I can to try and create that connect. But I think it's a long project. But still, considering we've been down on performance, we’re clearly down on end-of-straight pace compared to the Red Bulls, for us to be up here fighting with Aston is just amazing at this point in the season. And we’ve just got to keep on fighting. Big, big thank you to all the people back to the factory. Let's keep pushing. We can close that gap. It's going to be tough, but not impossible. No, no. I definitely wasn't bluffing. I think, honestly, I was having to push a lot to keep… Right at the beginning, obviously, to keep Max behind. And then Fernando was pushing, you know, they're very, very quick. So I think ultimately, he was a little bit quicker today behind me, but I just managed to hold him off. So, for that I'm really grateful and also just… What a legend. We’ve got a World Champion up ahead. We've got two World Champions in the top three or three World Champions in the top three. That's pretty mega. It was very unexpected. Obviously just coming into the weekend, but obviously, also getting a second and third and qualifying yesterday really blew us all away and a huge boost of energy throughout the team. So that meant today we had a shot at, you know, trying to at least overtake Max for a second. And so, we both got ahead, which was amazing. To have a Mercedes one-two for a second. And obviously he came sailing by at one stage, but it was a really entertaining race and I had a really good battle with Fernando, which was awesome. I thought it was pretty decent. I mean, he braked early and I braked late and I was fully up the inside and I think we both left space for each other. I didn't run him off the road and he didn't turn in on me. So we didn't touch and that’s racing. I think Fernando's a little bit quicker this afternoon. I mean, he was in my tow, so I think we were probably slightly quicker on the straight and he was quicker through all the corners. So I think we definitely have some performance to find. It definitely wasn’t easy keeping him at bay, and keeping them out of the DRS zone. But it was really quite interesting, just to see where we were, where we were lacking, and where we were good. And so there's lots of positives to take from today but we do naturally need to add on some performance. I mean, they've been ahead the past two races but for us to somehow still finish ahead is pretty awesome. So I'll definitely take it. Yeah, I think I had a lot more tyre than I thought that I did at the end. There was a moment where I thought the tyre was opening up and Fernando was applying pressure, then backing off and I had decent pace and then closing the gap again. He had two or three charges which I had to then really up the ante and try to match him, which was which was tough. I was able to be around a tenth or so off him, or sometimes ahead. But definitely, with 18 laps to go, I was thinking jeez, I don't know if these tyres are going go all the way. But then he had a moment where he backed off and I was able to save a bit and then got into a good rhythm and I was able to just keep that gap exactly the same for those last 10 laps or whatever. So was just counting it down, just hoping, hoping that it would just stick with it. And yeah, he was very, very consistent from what I could tell, didn't make any mistakes. Fernando doesn't make a lot of mistakes. So, it needed to be a good job. I was always trying to get to first, even when I was third. And then obviously up alongside Max at the end, I really was hoping for a better start than I got. We both got pretty much similar getaways and then he had a better second phase. And then it's just not to lose out to Fernando you know, he's having good starts as well. So it's all very, very close and all within a meter or so by the time you get to Turn 1. Initially, I was trying to get ahead and then otherwise we're just at the end not wanting to lose a position to the Aston.",Australia,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"No. We had a very poor start and then lap one, I was careful, because I had a lot to lose and they had a lot to win, you know. So, yeah, after that I mean I think the pace of the car was quick, you could see that straightaway. We were always there waiting for the DRS to open up, to have a chance to pass. But yeah with these red flags… I don't know, the first one maybe you can do it, but that second one, I don't really understand it. So, it was a bit of a mess. But yeah, we survived everything. We had good pace in the car today again, and we won, which of course is the most important [thing]. From my side, I just tried to avoid a contact. It's quite clear in the rules what is allowed to do, what you're allowed to do now on the outside. But clearly it's not followed. But that's OK, you know, we had good pace and we passed them anyway. But it's something for the next races to take into account. Yeah, I think I did the city a favour. I just cut the grass a bit more so they don't need to do that anymore in that area. So yeah, I don't know. I locked up a bit and didn’t want to flat-spot the tyre completely, so I ran a bit wide but we had a good margin. Yeah, I mean, it's great to win here. My first win [here] as well. It's been a while for the team as well. But yeah, very, very happy. But also, it's still great to see that the fans are having a good time even now. You know, they had a long wait, for the whole day. I'd like to say a big thank you to them as well, you know, for sticking around. I mean, of course, very happy to win the race. But I think the race itself towards the end was a bit of a mess with all the calls. Yeah, I don't think we needed that second red flag. I think that could have been done with a Virtual Safety Car or a Safety Car at worst. [To the others drivers] but yeah, OK… short. You see, he wants to leave. You need to go? But yeah, we'll talk about it. I think it left a lot of drivers confused, why we needed a red flag. Okay, well talk in Baku! Yes. I don’t know, today was quite messy, yeah. Yeah, the first one was not good. Just didn't really get well off the line. And I think, actually it just got better and better, my starts. So at least that's an improvement! I think I was also quite careful. I think I could have been a little bit more aggressive. But on the other hand, I didn't want to have any damage on my car, because I knew that we had a quick car, right? So even losing one or two spots was not the end of the world. I think it was also the nature of the track, with the very low deg. So, I think that all made it a bit closer. The warm-up was also quite tricky. Some teams probably nailed it a bit better than others. So yeah, difficult to say. I think we need to go to a few more tracks to have a full understanding. Yeah, just a tiny lock-up and they want to flat spot the tyres, so I ran a bit wide, cut the grass a bit, saved Melbourne a bit of money to cut the grass there. But I don’t think Lewis was alongside me. I think my start was a little bit better than what I had before, so I was happy about that because the tyres were really, really cold. And then, of course, after Turn 1, I saw there were massive gaps behind me, so I thought already there was something going on, and then I saw the replays and it was just a lot of chaos behind. So yeah, how it goes sometimes. Yeah, I mean I had a terrible first one so I was actually not really looking forward to it. But luckily we seem to improve it a bit afterwards. But I think it was a bit more difficult because of how cold the tyres were so you also didn't really know what you're going to get off the line. To be honest with you I think I braked a bit late and then I lost my reference a bit but then I looked and I was like I still have a little bit more space. I actually moved a bit forwards and yeah, it was really on the limit. But on the limit is on the limit, it’s not over the limit. Yeah, the sun was also quite difficult at the end, the visibility especially into Turn 1, Turn 3 was quite tough. I think it's quite clear, I just didn't understand why we needed a red flag. I think if you would have had a Safety Car and then just had a normal rolling start we wouldn't have had all these shunts and then you have a normal finish. So they created the problems themselves at the end of the day.",Australia,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think the last run was very good. I mean, the whole weekend has been very tough to get the tyres in the right window, to push straight away. But it all worked out in Q3. So yeah, very happy with the lap. And of course, very happy to be in pole position. And yeah, already looking forward to tomorrow, really. No, normally not. I think we always try to fine tune and we'll continue to do that. Yeah, almost hit a bird! Luckily, that didn't happen. Yeah, that happens sometimes on the street circuit, but I think tomorrow we will have a good race car. But again, it's quite tricky on the tyres to keep them alive and stuff. So it's going to be an interesting race for sure. I have been on the podium once but I want to be on a different step this time. Yeah, the last lap was pretty decent. Up until then it was just really tricky to find the grip and to try to nail it on one lap. I think you could see everyone was doing either like a build or were going faster on the second attempt. But yeah, I only had time in that last run to go out and just go for that first time. But this time, yeah, it worked out. So yeah, very happy with that. I think overall, it was going quite well. You know, Q1, Q2, Q3. But like I said, just very tough to get the tyres to work in Turn 1, you know, to get that comfortable feeling through that corner. I think that has been a bit the story again the whole week. And I also think it wouldn't have mattered if we had full running in FP1 and FP2, just on the performance lap, but it seems very tricky with this new tarmac around here since last year. Yeah, I mean, I did a long run in in FP3. So I had a bit of a read on the tyres. And yeah, I don't think it's a straightforward race with the tyres. But I think what we've shown so far this year, I think the car normally is good in the race. I'm a little bit surprised, maybe they are also a little bit surprised! But I guess it's a good thing. But again, it's all about just having the tyres in the right window, and I guess they did a good job with that as well. No, it's not an issue, it's just not good. I mean, it's something I always want improved. And I think also my first run in Q3 was slower than Q2, so the laps were not amazing at that time. Normally, not for me. I don't know. I think this track is a bit tricky to pass but that extra DRS zone will help, for sure. But again, it's just really difficult to say. I mean, it depends also, how the pace of the other cars are in the race, if they have tyre deg, or if you’re better on deg. A lot of factors come into play. George explained it well. Yeah, I'm not a fan of it at all. But also, I think when we're going to do all that kind of stuff, the weekend becomes even more intense and we're already doing so many races. So I think that is not the right way to go at it. I understand, of course, they want to have basically every day exciting, but then I think maybe it's better to just reduce the weekend, only race on Saturday and Sunday and make those two days exciting because we're heading into seasons where you have at one point 24/25 races, because that's where we're going to head into, and if we then start adding even more stuff, it's not worth it for me anyway. I'm not enjoying that. And for me, a Sprint race is all about surviving, it's not about racing. For me, when you have a quick car, there's nothing to risk. I prefer to just keep my car alive and make sure that you have a good race car for Sunday. And even if you change the format, I don't find it's the DNA of Formula 1 to do these kinds of Sprint races. F1 is about getting the most out of it in qualifying and then having an amazing Sunday, good long race distances. That's the DNA of the sport and I don't understand or I don't know why we should change that because I think the action has been good. And how do you get even more action is about getting the cars closer, getting more teams able to fight for the win. And I think naturally the show will be great. If we have six, seven teams already fighting for a win, that will be insane. Then you really don't need to change anything. Yeah, it was but then of course at the end in Q3, I still did only one lap. But like I said, it's just been really hard to get the tyres to work especially in the first sector after just an out lap and yeah, it has something to do with the time like around here where… get the tyres in the right working range initially. And with all these 90 degree corners, if you have a tiny moment, you lose immediately a lot of momentum. So yeah, it's the same for everyone. We have to deal with it. In the race normally, of course it all stabilises after one lap, and then it's not a problem but it definitely makes it a bit more tricky to get the most out of it in qualifying whereas some other tracks you at one point understand a bit what you have to do more or less on an out lap and then you nail it on one lap. But yeah, here it's a little bit more complicated.",Australia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"We wasn't (sic) expecting that, that's for sure! Yeah, a lot of hard work going on back at a factory and here in Melbourne. And wow, what a session for us. You know, the car felt alive. The lap at the end was right on the limit. And I’ve got to be honest, I was a little bit disappointed that we didn't get pole position. It's one of those things, how your expectations change so quickly in this sport. We probably would have been happy with a top four, top five yesterday, but the car felt awesome. And it goes to show we've definitely got potential still to come. It must be the jet lag programme we're doing! Something’s got to be right! I don't know. I don't know. So yeah, we’ve got to understand obviously, when you have good days and bad days, but we'll take it. We'll take it and we're excited for tomorrow. It's going to be tough against Max, but definitely very, very happy to be lining up in P2. Yes, it is a surprise, there's no doubt about it. I think we're learning more and more about this car. We know it's not where we want it to be. But it's probably evolved, just with the set-up, since Bahrain to Jeddah, to here. We've seen that performance improvement with the exact same car. For sure tyres played a big part this weekend, as Max alluded to, and the pace on that final lap was quite surprising. Really pleased to be just two and a half tenths off, when you know, we were a second off on other occasions. So yeah, let's see what tomorrow brings. I think the feeling of the car is not the limitation, to be honest. The car feels pretty decent. It's probably the best F1 car I've ever driven, or raced, sorry – probably excluding the obvious 2020 experience with Mercedes. But we're just lacking a bit of downforce. We know we've made some huge gains over the past two or three weeks in the wind tunnel, and hopefully we'll be bringing that to the track sooner rather than later. But, you know, this result today is going to give us a huge amount of confidence, regardless of what tomorrow brings, over the course of the next four weeks, because if we can deliver a performance like this with a car that is definitely quite a bit off the pace, it shows good promise for when we bring our first upgrade. We've got to go for it, haven’t we? We’ve got to go for a win. Max is going to be extremely fast, there’s no hiding that. I think it’s difficult to overtake around this circuit, so the start, lap one, is going to be vital – but the Red Bull has extraordinary top speed. So, it’s going to be very difficult to fight with Max. But let's see. Let's see how we get on. We’ve got to do our own race. If the opportunity is there, we will go for it. For sure, we maximised the job today, no doubt about it, but we had a good qualifying last week in Jeddah. I didn't put my lap together in the last run in Jeddah, and was only a tenth off P3. So no, I don't think it's necessarily track specific. I do think we're making some improvement with the understanding of the car. Yeah, I don't really know. But for sure the tyres play a big factor. You know, when you get those tyres in the sweet spot, you make a big jump, and I think even I improved four-tenths maybe on my last, my last run in Q3. So unfortunately, it’s all tyres, tyres, tyres. I think it'll be challenging around here. For sure he will come through to the top 10. But I don't think, on a circuit like this, you'd be able to fight it towards the front. Obviously, after a frustrating Qualifying, like the one we had in Bahrain, you say some things in the heat of the moment, I do still think Red Bull are a class ahead of everybody else and for sure Lewis and I got the most out of it today. And by the sounds of what Max is saying, there was probably still a little bit more in the locker. And we're talking that three-tenths is a little bit. Normally, they’re a second ahead. Now, they’re three-tenths ahead. That’s still a huge amount in the world of F1. So, you know, we're not going to give up, we're going to keep on pushing. And I think, right now we'll have to reassess when we bring some upgrades to the car. And that will be the first time when we truly know if they work as we expect and if we can fight them. But yeah, why not? Initially, when I read that, I was a little disappointed, because I think that's part of the sport. Then I heard it's only about climbing the fences, they can still stand on the pit wall and I think some of the older circuits we go to, we stand on those fences, they do wobble and if you've got 20, 30 big guys on there – I know, we've got some big boys in our team – you'd never want to see something like that happen. So yeah, I guess it's a shame in some ways but I don't know, if we saw something like that fall in when the cars are passing that'd be pretty horrific. What is the proposal? When the Sprint race was introduced in the beginning I wasn't a fan. After doing nine of them, I've become more in favour. I don't think a one-lap qualifying would ever go ahead and from the things I've heard that wouldn't be on the cards. I trust in what Stefano and F1 are doing. It's difficult to see, in the beginning, the prospects, but we've got to keep on evolving. I do think, globally, qualifying and the Grand Prix work very well, but I'm open to change, review, and going again but as I said, I trust them and I’ll back them whatever they believe is right. I think having the action on the Friday. Arriving to the track, having action every single day, also for fans in the crowd, I think just watching cars circulating in practice, I don't think it's as exciting as when you have a qualifying session like this or a Sprint race. So I think it's exciting for us, for the teams, and for the fans. So yeah, probably that.",Australia,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"Oh, yeah. I'm so happy with this. What's up Melbourne? How are you doing? This is totally unexpected. I’m really, really proud of the team. George did a fantastic job today, so for us to be up on the two front rows is honestly a dream for us. We're all working as hard as we can to get right back up the front and to be this close to the Red Bull is honestly incredible. So I hope tomorrow we can give them a bit of a run for their money. And we hope the weather is good. The second lap wasn't as good as obviously the first one. I did get a little bit further ahead in the last sector, but ultimately, yeah, I lost out a little bit at the beginning. But I'm not disappointed. I'm super grateful for this position and I'm just going to work as hard as I can to try and move forward tomorrow. To get to first! Yeah, I'm going to try and see… I’ll be hoping for a day like the first year, 2007, Turn 1 here, that would be awesome. I don't know if anyone here remembers but yeah, that'd be awesome if we can do that. I think it's perhaps track-specific, but I think ultimately there's no one in the team that's had their heads down, in terms of giving up, everyone's been working incredibly hard to try to squeeze the most out of what we currently have. We are, as George mentioned, a little bit down on downforce, where we really want to be. But everything came together today. So I mean, it feels amazing to be up here, either side of Max. And I really hope that tomorrow, we can somehow hold on to him. He might pull away into the distance like he has done in the past, but we'll give it our best shot. I think it's difficult to say. I mean, I haven't even done a long run. So tomorrow, going into the race, will be the first time I do so. And I've not seen where we tally up compared to them. But I mean, I think they generally have… we have to expect they're going to be a quarter of a second, half a second, at least, quicker than us. But maybe in the tow, maybe we can just about hold on; maybe the fact that there's two of us and only one Red Bull, maybe with strategy, maybe we can apply some pressure to them. So, we'll see. Yeah, honestly, that felt like a great lap. And it was very, very surreal to see us at the top for a second. And then obviously, I saw Max was finishing his lap, so just about lost it. But then the last lap just wasn't really that great. Unfortunately, as Max mentioned, just difficult to get the tyres working. Yeah, left plenty of performance on the table, just in the sense of just couldn't get the tyres really working. So, the second lap was a bit average. But still, I managed to get it up there for the team. And tomorrow I will do better. It definitely was a little bit confusing and definitely wasn't an optimum way of starting your lap. Normally, you need to try and keep pace up in that last sector. But there was a lot going on. So it wasn't as good as the start of the previous lap. So I think we did lack a little bit of temperature, and it picked up towards the end of the lap and my last sector, I think, was a little bit better. But yeah, that's how it goes sometimes. Same. Same. I can't even remember what the question was. What's the question? No, but I think, like you said, I think this gives everyone in the team a boost and a glimpse of hope and this will spur everyone on and will inspire everyone to continue to push. We know that if we can just bring a little bit of performance we can close the gap to the front. Still, there are going to be places where the gap is a lot bigger, so today, whilst the gap looks small, in other places, as I said, you look at the last race, it was a bit of a bigger gap. So yeah, I think if we just try to stay consistent, we’ve got great reliability then we can continue to apply the pressure, bag those points and then when the car is right, maybe we can start fighting for wins. That'd be incredible. Nothing to add. I've not read them so I don't know what the rule is exactly, but I do think we constantly need to be evolving and assessing what we're doing. And I think the changes with the Sprint races has been positive in some places. Baku, we couldn't do a one-lap qualifying because these tyres don't work after one lap, and especially if we've got no blankets, then we'll be doing more laps. So I don't know. But I'm open to changes, to continue to make it more inclusive and more engaging for the fans. I quite like the Friday of a Sprint weekend so far. I'd love to have more qualifying because that's always super fun. And I just think it should… different. Perhaps we can just apply just slightly small changes to different races, specific for those places where if a race where you can't overtake like Monaco, what else can we do there to make it more exciting. Yeah, that's about it.",Australia,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, very, very special, obviously. To race in my home country and also, like you said, hometown as well. I played Aussie Rules footy and cricket on some of the ovals that are now the paddock, so yeah, very special to be at home this weekend. It is. Yeah. So, the last time I raced in Australia, I was still in go-karts. I think it was seven years ago now. So yeah, nice to get out on a racetrack in Oz. Yeah, I was here last year as a reserve driver, and I was here, I think, 2015. I was a grid-kid, actually for Dany Kvyat, so I was holding Dany Kvyat’s flag, and he broke down on the lap-to-grid, so I never actually got to see him. But yeah, it’s pretty special to have someone holding my flag this time but hopefully I have better luck. I think qualifying especially gave me a lot of confidence in the way that we're working is the right way. I think I didn't really change that much from Bahrain, but the results in Qualifying were much different, obviously getting to Q3 this time. So yeah, it was a nice confidence boost. Sunday, obviously nice to see the end, at least. But yeah, I think on the first lap I probably could have done a few things differently and maybe kept myself out of trouble a bit better, but I think the rest of the race, it's nice to get a race distance under my belt at least. And definitely some learning and getting rid of some of the rust still. We'll try our best obviously. I think compared to the previous two tracks here should be more like Saudi, I hope. Tarmac’s quite similar. The layout is a bit more similar to Saudi compared to Bahrain. So, hopefully, that is good for us. But yeah, I think, you know, Saudi we showed we can get into Q3 and fight for the back-end of points on our good days. So hopefully, we can just have a clean race and my front wing doesn't wipe out Lando, this time. And we'll see what we can do. No, I won't be going to the footy on Friday. I'll be trying to get a good night's rest. But also behaving myself on food this week. I mean, it's hard in Melbourne but no. Went and saw mum, went and saw my Dad and had some home cooked meals, which was nice. But yeah, I've been keeping it pretty sensible this week. Yep, it all happened pretty quick in Bahrain to be honest, you know, did the driver parade and then the laps to the grid national anthem and then helmet on and jump in the car. I think someone missed their grid box in front of me, so when the lights came on, I was actually still pulling up into my grid box, which was a bit of a ‘welcome to F1’. But no, it was good, and nice to get the first one out of the way and I think this year obviously I’m looking forward to racing here at home. I think, for me, Spa is my favourite track on the calendar so I'm looking forward to going back there. Silverstone as well – another awesome track and obviously McLaren’s home race as well. So plenty of favourites this year. Yeah, it's been reasonably busy. I think we've been managing it very well. Obviously, having Mark in my corner is very useful, because he's been in my shoes plenty of times here in Melbourne and obviously the team have got experience with Daniel in the last couple of years as well. So, I think we're very organised with that kind of thing. I came out here a little bit early, so I could firstly get used to the jetlag, but also to see some friends and family, which was nice. And then I think the rest has been very well managed. It's not been too crazy. And it's allowing me for the rest of the weekend to fully focus on driving, which is nice. Yeah, I think, for me, it's a nice opportunity to, I guess, look back at the first three races of my F1 career and digest what went well, what went not so well. And it’s a bit of a reset for the rest of the year. So, I think it'll be nice for everyone. Obviously, you want to keep that momentum if you’re going well, it's a good chance to reset if you're not, so I think we'll use it to our advantage. I think it'll definitely help us to move closer to the front of the grid. I'm sure all the other teams have got upgrades of their own as well. And I think what we've got coming in Baku is a good step in what is a bigger plan throughout the rest of the season. So it'll help a bit, definitely, and get us on the right track, I hope. But, I think we are not underestimating that everyone else will probably have new parts as well, so we'll see how much competitiveness we gain from that. Yeah, it was fine after the race. Neck was a little bit sore by the end, because Jeddah is pretty tough. But yeah, it felt good. I think with more and more laps I'll get more and more used to it as well. But no, it was all good after the race. Yeah, I think so. Obviously, in Bahrain I only had a few laps to get rid of it, but you know, I think that every lap I do in the car I'm getting more and more used to it again. And you know, every race that I do, every first lap I do, it comes back. I'm sure it's going away but I still need some more experience.",Australia,thursday,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, good memories. But we are already looking… for this year, we are not coming into this race in the same situation as we were last year, I think. Clearly, our performance is not as good as last year. But we are working massively to try and come back at the front. Last year’s are good memories, as we can see on the images now. Everybody was really happy. But again, we are fully motivated to be back in the front, we know where we need to work on. I don't think there will be any miracles for this weekend. But after that we've got a three-week break, and we'll try to use it in the best way possible in order to bring upgrades as quickly as possible on the car. I don't know. In the end it’s a relative sport. So yes, it's an evolution from last year's car but clearly it's not enough when you look at where Red Bull is, especially in race pace. So yeah, we've got lots of work to do. I think that in qualifying, we've been quite good since the beginning of the season. Where we need to focus on is the race where our car is extremely peaky. When all the conditions are right, we seem to be able to extract the performance out of our package but whenever the conditions are changing a little bit, with a heavier car where you see a little bit more the limitations of the car, then that's where we struggle. So we are trying to focus on that. I do believe that we’ll be quite close in qualifying – I hope so – but I think that the picture in the race will be quite similar. I don't think it will change much. Well, I think you can take Max's comments and turn them around and then it's kind-of an explanation for us. I think the first few races went quite well. Red Bull was a little bit on backfoot, reliability-wise, and also in performance, we were good. Then we had a time where there were just too many mistakes. And then we lost quite a bit of points. And then for the second half of the season, we were just not competitive enough. So yeah, but we know the story about last year, and now it's all about focusing on what we can do better to improve and to come back to their level. And, as I said before, we know where we need to work on. And now we just need to make it happen. Honestly, it is just to try and have a more solid car in all the conditions, just because we seem to be quite good in terms of Qualifying whenever the peak grip is there. But then, whenever we lose a little bit of grip in the race, then it starts to be very, very difficult and we seem to lose quite a lot of performance, so on that we need to work. Yeah, I think in the situation we are in as a team, we take this as an opportunity to work as much as possible during this break in order to get upgrades as quickly as possible and be as competitive as we want the sooner in this season. It's still a very, very long season, we've only done two races. So, we are fully motivated to get back on top. And we'll try to use these weeks in the best way possible. Well, honestly, I don't see the reason why. Obviously on our side, we've had two failures of the same component in the same weekend, which is unfortunately the first weekend of the season. But this is something that we need to fix internally. We know what went wrong. And yeah, I don't think that because of this, we need to change all of it.",Australia,thursday,Ferrari
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, obviously last year was actually quite good until the last lap where Alex was using the same set and pitted the last lap of the race. But yeah, apart from that, I really liked just firstly, the crowd and atmosphere here, and always see a lot of people – or a lot of people from my country, at least, living here or studying here. So it's great to have kind of semi-home support, in a way. And yeah, apart from that, I've just been not doing much, just trying to get rid of my jetlag. It’s been going well to get the preparation done for the race weekend ahead. Well, I hope he does after this – but not so much before that. It’s nice, actually, to see [FIA Formula 2] as a category, coming here, because when we were racing together we normally don't get to see all these places like here, going abroad and away from Europe. So yeah, I really like, in general, the culture here, and also my team-mate has a big influence, with this Australia-thing with his haircut, so I guess I'll get more from Valtteri than from Oscar, that's for sure! Yeah, I tried to not look at it as honestly it was not my thing! I don't know if some of you guys saw it but it was quite crazy. I mean, it's very similar to, let’s say, where they are with the McLarens. I think we are just fighting for the backfoot of the points. It’s clear there are three or four teams clearly ahead of the rest – but then I think from P8 downwards it is very tight. Everybody can be grabbing these final points finishes – which is the aim, or the target, realistically from. I feel like in Jeddah we were really close in Q3, also the race pace, running top ten most of the race before the pit-stop, and then passing into a trickier window. So, I think we can still fight for it. And we're not, you know, too far away from this. So it's just the little details that can really make the difference in the midfield. Yeah, obviously, I don't want to have that break, because you know which race was missing from that break! But yeah, I think with such a busy calendar we're going to, it’s not just about going to different race weekends, it’s also going to a lot of activities with the team, sponsorships. So I think it's always nice to have some period off and I think, you know, for most of the drivers to reset and try to prepare for the forthcoming [races] and work on the weaknesses and try to improve all these things.",Australia,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Fernando Alonso,"Well, obviously it feels good, feels nice to reach that number. But yeah, obviously when you are in a Championship, you're not really concentrated on that, you are just thinking about the next weekend, as we did after Jeddah, and here we are in Melbourne, and hopefully we have a strong weekend again. It is difficult. And yeah, apparently this year, it seems even more, because in two races to have two penalties is a little bit strange. But yeah, I mean, in my case, it didn't change much from last year. It is difficult and we are very concentrated on the yellow line to not go too far forward. So, you approached the box, let's say, not looking at the box, you are looking on one side of the cockpit. So maybe that's a bit of a distraction. But yeah, I made a mistake there. So we will try to be more focused on the box this weekend and avoid any penalty. The central line? I don't think so. Because as I said, you approach the box looking sideways, so you're not looking forward, so that's the biggest difficulty – but the 20 centimetres will help I guess. There's going to be some circuits, maybe Monaco, or Imola that you start a little bit sideways anyway. Because if not you crash if you start there straight. So, we'll have to see how we apply the penalties and things like that in those races. But yeah, no one wants to get a penalty for the start. Also, I think the FIA doesn't want to have any problem with that, because there is no performance advantage, as long as you don't go too forward. So yeah, hopefully we avoid anything from now on. Not yet. I think we have to wait and see. Also, I think very soon, from Baku or Imola, we will see the teams changing a few parts in the cars. And maybe that changes, also, how competitive you feel. So let's wait and see. At the moment we were extremely happy with the performance of the car, obviously. It was better than expected, especially in Jeddah. I think it was a nice surprise. So yeah, we arrived here with a good level of confidence. But, as I said, after a few events from now on, I think the cars will change a lot, in a few areas, and a few developments. So, let's see if we can keep this pace. I should ask if he's still using Number One, I will ask for 33 next year! Yeah, I mean, it's crazy to see how Spain is now so enthusiastic, again, for Formula 1 and for everything that is happening. So, you know, this is very, very nice to see. And hopefully I think they did enjoy these first two podiums, the whole country, and I think in Barcelona it’s going to be a big thing this year again. And yeah, this 33, I don't know, all these things that are happening now on social media. It was El Plan three years ago, and then The Mission, and now 33. So, there are a lot of 33s, and yeah, all the football clubs, or footballers, and now tennis, or whatever, and they are all doing something with 33. So, hopefully we can reach that number in terms of wins, and then we go for 34. I don’t know. I think it’s going to be okay, probably more fun to drive. It was a corner that I think was too slow for these Formula 1 cars and the size of these cars as well. I think it was not really enjoyable to drive, but it remains to be seen if the new layout will help the overtaking, or will help the show in general on the race. But I've been racing in that layout for a few years, including in Formula 1, so I think it will be more fun to drive and hopefully we put on a good show for everyone. There are a lot of orange shirts everywhere, so for sure there are some. For the grandstand, I think the whole circuit is going to be the grandstand. No, I prefer to keep racing. Yeah, I guess so. Obviously, you will use it just to prepare for the next race in a better way and review the first three races. And, you know, in my case it’s a new team, so there are a couple of things that we want to revisit and things. So, yeah it’s OK, but it's better to do it on a racetrack. It is! Yeah, it is. I didn't know that. I knew that the 101st podium for all the other five drivers that have reached 100 podiums was a race win? So, too many coincidences now. I mean, yeah, it was not ideal, but it was not frustrating, let's say, because I was in the podium ceremony and things like that. It would be very different if it was not that case. I think we will not talk too much at the drivers’ briefing. There's going to be, I'm sure, a few things from this place after the free practice. But yeah, the trophy’s at the factory. I haven't been to the factory yet, so I didn't see it. But it’s all good. It's not in the budget cap, the power unit… only for the customer teams!",Australia,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. I mean, of course, it was a bit different back then but yeah, this track, I think it's just because the last few years we've never really been that good at the beginning of the year. So, I think if this race would have been in a different place on the calendar then probably we would have had a lot better results here. But that's not how it is. But yeah, for sure we do need a bit of a good result here. Yeah, I think we have a good chance, of course, for a good result, but we do need to execute a good weekend yet. I think last year, our car was very heavily overweight at this stage of the season, so that didn't help. I think last year here we had a big shift in balance between Qualifying and the race, so that caught us out in the race. And yeah, we were not reliable. So that, of course, is never nice at the beginning of the year. But we also knew that there was a lot of potential in that car, just from the updates, but especially from the weight side of the car. But yeah, last year was very frustrating here, being slow in the race, retiring from the race. But I think we also understood quite quickly after the weekend, what we did wrong, of course, with the setup, but also, we had to work on our reliability, because I think, from then onwards, it was quite alright, in terms of reliability. And of course, we make big steps with the performance of the car. It’s a good number! I think Fernando should have won, already, a lot more races then he has done. I think he deserves a lot more. So yeah, I mean, I would be quite happy to see him win number 33. But I also, in a way, also would like to see him win more. So we'll see in the coming race. Yeah, we always have stock, don't worry! A bit more of an insight into me, but also very close family members and how they experienced my career and how we lived through the goal of getting to Formula 1, and then, you know, having the results in Formula 1. I mean, I'm normally not a guy who really likes to open up about these kinds of things, but I think it does give you a bit more of an insight into how everyone lived through that period. And yeah, I think it came out really nicely. I mean, I've watched it myself of course before, and yeah, just not only about myself, but also the people very close to me, how they see things, how they experience things and at the moment. So yeah, I think it's worth watching. Well, a couple of weeks ago, I would say that I was not looking forward to it. But then I got really ill and I’ve just been struggling a bit since that time, especially last race out. So for me now these three weeks is just getting back to, like, full fitness, getting a full programme in. So, in a way, it's probably nice now. Normally, if you just feel well, I think I would also prefer to keep racing. It has nothing to do with looking into the car, trying to make it faster. I think that's a natural process. But it's a bit weird to have three weeks off, especially that early in the season. Yeah, well, I refused to believe it myself for a long time. Because at home I was really ill, like I could barely just walk around and I felt like I was missing a lung. And yeah, I got to the weekend really believing that it was gone, because normally when you get sick, like, two or three days after you are normally alright, you can just do your workouts. But then when I jumped in the car in FP1… Even just one performance lap, I felt like I had to recover for two laps to be able to breathe normally. So yeah, it definitely did affect me throughout the weekend, which I didn't like, because it was one of the first races where I Just felt like I was physically limited. And that's really frustrating when you're out in the car. But yeah, since then I've been trying to work on it, trying to improve it and I do think that it has improved a lot. So normally this weekend should be alright. I think it was just all coming together in Jeddah. It is quite a tough track in general and when you don't feel well, it hits hard on you. But yeah, these things unfortunately happen, you know, that you catch a virus and stuff. So, yeah, hopefully, from now onwards, for the rest of the year, I should be okay.",Australia,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean, obviously, it was the right decision. It was just a bit of a shame, what a mess it was for everybody else included, I think from my side and our side, we didn't feel like we deserved to finish in third position, but obviously it's quite a nice feeling when it's handed to you. And then when it's obviously taken away from you again… It was all a bit silly. Fernando was actually the first person to tell me that I'd lost the position, because I bumped into him at the airport. So he clearly had some insider info. But congrats to him, he was a deserving P3 finisher. Yeah, to be honest, I felt like Saudi was probably one of my strongest weekends I've ever had with Mercedes, from qualifying, really pleased with how that went, the race felt really strong. And P4 was, I think, the absolute maximum we could have achieved. I think the Ferraris were probably a little bit fast for us that weekend. We also had Stroll, who obviously had the failure, but he was right behind us. So P4 was a good result. Yeah, I mean, I don't read what's been said in the news all the time. But you know, we're here to win, we're here to fight for victories and for the championship and clearly we're not in a position to do that at the moment. But big changes are incoming. There's nothing that you'll see on the car this weekend, because naturally you can't get things brought that quickly to the car. But I think in due course, we'll see some big changes and hopefully the lap times represent that. Yeah, I mean, we're working really hard at the moment with these changes. I won't give too much away. And we need to make sure they work as expected. But as we've said a number of times, we’re probably finding more gains in the past two or three weeks than we found over the whole winter by clearly developing in the wrong window. So yeah, it's definitely heading in the right direction. I think if we manage to get another P4 or fight for the podium that will probably be exceeding the potential of the car. I think Aston [Martin] are going to be really strong here. They seem to be the quickest car in medium-speed corners and obviously there's plenty of them here in Melbourne. So, if we can fight with Aston and Ferrari again, that'd be a good weekend. Shopping! I think no is the answer. Obviously the more practice you do, the more up to speed you'll be, the more comfortable you'll be with the car. I don't think it's right that Formula 1 has three times the amount of practice that you have in the F3 and F2 categories. They should be the ones to get more practice, also because they're doing less races, they don't get to test that often. No practice would be too little. I wasn't in favour of the sprint races initially, but having done - how many have we done now? Six, nine, maybe over the two years? I really enjoy the sprint races and having action on a Friday, I think, is vital for all of us and also for the entertainment factor. I think, just practice to dial in the car, to test things for the future. We obviously have no testing at all. I think one session is good enough for all of us to do the various things we need to try and to help develop. This is still the pinnacle of the sport and you don't want to be just left with the car that you created at the start of the year with no opportunity to try out new things. And that is sort of the beauty, sometimes; you've got this 60-minute session, you can try new things, develop, improve further. Whereas if you're going straight into a session that is points-worthy or there is a reward, you're less likely to trial new things. I probably say, for the benefit of the two or 3,000 people travelling around the world, having the first session on a Friday afternoon, evening so there's less pressure for teams to arrive, let’s say, on a Wednesday. If you have your first session on Friday morning you need to be here on a Thursday which for a lot of the races requires flying on a Wednesday and if we can push that back to allow teams to fly on a Thursday morning… You add that up over 24 races in a year, you’re getting on for almost a month extra at home or sleeping in your own bed, which is huge for everybody in this circus. So yeah, I'd say Sprint format, but just making sure that first session is delayed a bit. Yeah, I think collectively, we have a really strong input. And I think Stefano’s incredibly open to hear our views and have conversations. There's obviously been a lot of talk about how sustainable the calendar is, jumping from the Middle East to America and back to Europe. And I think in years to come that will be improved. I think for a lot of the fans it doesn't make a lot of sense. There are a lot of limitations with the climate; we race at certain events and limitations of street circuits, of when they can open them. But definitely I think Australia needs to be back-to-back with a Middle Eastern race, because I think almost all of us flew out here on a Saturday or Sunday last week. All of the mechanics, the engineers likewise so you're already losing those additional three or four days. So yeah, it makes sense to be back to back with a Middle Eastern race. Yeah, I don't think there's any luck in it at all, I think it's down to the preparation you put in before the event and the changes we made overnight, I knew that was going to be the right direction with the work we did with the team. And I believed it was going to be better than the setup that Lewis opted for. So yeah, I think everybody's got different preferences. I was happy with the direction I took and with the work I'm doing with the engineers. I think it's incredibly tough. I think a five-second penalty for being laterally out is probably too harsh. Yeah, we can't see anything when we line up so yeah, the penalty needs to be reflected on the difficulty. I think it's a case of managing expectations, and just focusing on yourself and that development. We all believed over the winter what we were doing was correct because it was an evolution of what we did throughout last year. And we all saw the improvements we made as a team throughout last year to win a race at the end of the year and be fighting at the front. Yeah, it caught us by surprise to see the lack of performance when we hit the track in Bahrain and that's why we were quick to change our approach. I think already on the Saturday night of the Bahrain Grand Prix, we were trying different things, going in a different direction with the development because we recognised we’d maybe gone too far. So I'm not going to sit here and say we're incredibly optimistic. All I will say is we are making improvements and that should translate into lap time. But we recognise that Red Bull are over a second down the road at the moment.",Australia,thursday,Mercedes
Pierre Gasly,"Ha! Actually, it's been a pretty busy last couple of days. But I will say, highlights? Driving a V8 Supercar was pretty cool. That was definitely a very enjoyable experience. It was only a few laps. We've got a bit of drifting in as well yesterday. The team kept us busy, but yeah, very enjoyable so far. I wouldn't say that I'm pleased because we obviously want to fight higher up the grid and it feels like so far we’re a bit in no man's land behind the top four teams. I had a bit of the midfield behind us, even though it's really close, but we are still chasing and trying to get closer to those front runners. So obviously, it’s been only two racetracks and I think it’s going to be interesting to see how things go in Melbourne, a different track than Jeddah. But generally, I think it's been an OK start, a decent start, but as a team we want to be fighting for bigger points. Yeah, I’m confident. I think the team definitely showed last year they were probably the best team in terms of development through the year, so there's a good understanding and correlation between the upgrades they're bringing on the racetrack, so it's just a matter of time until we see new parts coming on the car and obviously there is also this part of understanding between the team and myself, really understanding what I need out of a race car to extract the maximum of it. It's been only two races and as I say, decent, but generally speaking, the overall performance hasn't been as good as we aim for and we'll work to make that better over the next few races. Yeah, I think it's going to be interesting. We know obviously that Melbourne is usually a very difficult track to overtake, so if you can increase the overtaking opportunities, increase the racing, make it slightly more entertaining and a bit more racier on that track, I think that's definitely positive. But it's not guaranteed. We'll see in practice what we get and the most important thing is just to make sure we are fast enough to fight for the points we want. Socialising? Yeah, I agree with George. Definitely, three’s no needed from a driving point of view. It's always nice, you can work on fine details on the car and really try to nail the car balance for the weekend but generally speaking, I think one, two maximum, is more than enough for us. So yeah, I kind of agree. On the sprint races I think we've had different feedback. I think there's a lot of discussions on what to explore and how to increase the entertainment and the racing, so I think it's good to always kind of question what we're doing and kind of looking at how we can improve the format and just the whole format of the weekend in general. Double. No surprises he’s running the GPDA! I think George has got a great idea. I think I support that. We’re all quite keen, I think there were a lot of talks in trying to push the weekend a bit forward, having a session on the Friday and yeah, I think I think we all quite keen to do that, especially with more racing on the calendar and always more talks to add these races in the future. So definitely, yeah, keen on trying that and Friday for practice, more action on Saturday. I think the Sprint is definitely something to explore, as well, but just keeping the main Grand Prix on Sunday, and not changing the DNA of the sport. Yeah, I agree. It's quite… one of the most stressful times of the race, to be fair. If you look back at the first two races of the year, two drivers got penalised. I don't think this is necessary and I think it’s good we are increasing and just giving us slightly more space. It doesn't really change anything for anyone, just making it slightly easier for us because the visibility from inside the cars is very limited obviously. And yeah, I think that's a positive change.",Australia,thursday,Alpine
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah, it's a great town, fantastic track here, the park atmosphere. I think I've always had pretty good runs here, of races, a lot of points. So we look forward to getting out there tomorrow, discovering the slightly new layout now, more high speed. And yeah, happy to be here. Yeah, I did a brief couple of laps. Yeah, it's definitely much more flowing, more fast speed, a lot of medium speed corners, high speed corners. So yeah, it feels pretty pretty rapidly fast. It's gone OK. It's still obviously very early doors. No result, a point, just yet but I feel it's a lot of good progress being made over the first two races. Obviously the beginning of the season is such a steep learning curve for the team but also for myself after the time away. So I feel pretty happy and confident that there's more good things ahead of us. No, he hasn't. Yeah, I think it comes down to a bit your personal opinion preference. I think we have a good amount of practice now. Thinking back to what George said about the junior series, I quite enjoyed it at the time, having only 30 minutes, like in F2 and then getting thrown into qualifying. So, yeah, I think it's a matter of personal preference and opinion. So, yeah, can discuss that for a long time probably. I don't know. It's not something I think about actively because the schedule is the way it is and we will come here and we have this rhythm. Since I've been in F1 it's always been the three practice sessions; now it's already cut shorter which kind of feels good. And I think it's good the way the build-up of the weekend is: Friday’s a practice day and Saturday is more important, tension rises and then Sunday the highlight, the main day, so, no big desire, personally, to change anything. Yeah, it's kind of easy to misplace your car a little bit. The cars have also got wider over the past few years I feel. So yeah, extending the width, for sure, will help a little bit.",Australia,thursday,Haas
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, it honestly reminds me a little bit of America, to be honest, quite familiar in the feel of the city to be honest. And yeah, it's always a place and a track I've wanted to visit, so pretty excited to be here for the first time. Cool stuff, I'm not sure. I took a nice walk around the city just to check it out. Other than that it’s just been training and sort of getting acclimated to Melbourne. Too many laps in the sim, that's for sure. But it's honestly a track that I've driven on sims for however long - since I was a kid, just a track I've always looked forward to coming to and we did a track walk yesterday to really get a lay of the land and it looks awesome, tricky, but looking forward to taking it on. What haven't I [enjoyed]? It's hard to pick one; I've loved everything. And I think, honestly, just having the element of going against 19 of the best drivers in the world. And really challenging myself to step up and make something happen. I wouldn’t say I cut it but… Yeah, I think Saudi was a really good step forward in terms of qualifying pace from Bahrain even though nothing came of it but I think that was super positive. I feel honestly super comfortable in the car. I feel like I've got my feet under the table. But there's still a lot to learn in the races so trying to get on top of that. I've always been very comfortable with my qualifying pace coming from the previous series. So just trying to get on top of the race runs. Yeah, I think three is definitely a lot, especially coming from F2 where you just have to take risks a lot sooner than I currently have to. So as a rookie, I don't mind having two or three but going forward, I don't think three is necessary. Well, it is my favourite number! I think just coming from F3 and F2 where you can see everything, you can see the yellow line, it's really easy to line the car up in the right spot. First thing I noticed, the first time I lined up in a grid box in an F1 car, you can't see anything. You can't see any of the lines, so you have to take a marker on the wall to your right or left to know how far forward you can pull as well. So it is a lot more difficult and I'm not surprised that there are struggles.",Australia,thursday,Williams
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it turned out to be tougher than expected. That Safety Car… We really did the job in the first stint, but that Safety Car again tried to take the victory out of us, again, in Jeddah, but not this time. I was on for the victory last year, so finally I got it. And the team did a fantastic job. I mean, the job they've done, they've worked so hard during the weekend, you know, we have had a lot of mechanical issues and these guys have been on top of that, so I'm really happy for them and it's time to celebrate. Yeah, exactly. So we will keep pushing. We will keep pushing hard. The important thing, I think, is that we were the fastest car out there today. So I'm very pleased with that. Yeah, I think there is some work to do, we've changed the procedure a bit from our side, so I think we need to do some work to get better starts in the future. Thank you. Well, it's just another word that I learned this week from my engineers. That’s something else. Step by step. I think yeah, just in general, it was looking better, the race. You know, once I got past Fernando, I could do my own race. But once again, when that Safety Car came out, it reminded me all over, Jeddah last year again, and it was like, ‘not again’. But luckily, we didn't pit. We hadn’t pitted at the time. So yeah, it was a new race after the Safety Car, you know. Very early on, Max came back and we were basically, towards the end, just making sure we kept that healthy gap between myself and Max. But that meant we were pushing quite hard and trying to maintain the gap. No, I did enjoy the race, to be honest. I enjoyed it a lot, especially at the end, just pushing each other with the lap times, knowing that he went a tenth faster, a tenth slower, a tenth faster and it was all pretty intense and then we were told to maintain a certain pace. And I was told again to push them to maintain the pace. So it was just a bit all over the place. It's very hard to judge. I mean, the race was strong. It was a strong race, managing it well. I think we did a great job. I don't know if it's my best weekend so far with the team, but I'm sure Melbourne will be even better. Yeah, I didn't get a good launch. It’s something I need to work with the engineers to make sure we fix that. Fernando just got a better start and we lost the position. But I knew that it was not the end of the world. It's a 50-lap race. It's a pretty long one. And it was more important to manage my tyres at the time. And I mean, just don't get mad and make sure that I was able to do my own race. I think at the moment, I’m pretty happy with the car. I had a bit of a scrappy weekend leading up to Qualifying – but I think effectively we managed to have a very good race car. More than Quali, so yeah, at the moment I am feeling very comfortable with the car. Yeah, I asked two laps from the end, while they were telling us… where they told me to keep a certain pace. They told me I had the fastest lap and to keep the pace, a certain pace. So I thought the communication was the same to Max or something. We need to review because I got certainly the different information and I just couldn't push it there. Yeah, it's really difficult just to see where you’ve stopped. I think, in my opinion I just overdid it and I stopped too early, but you have no idea when you are in the car. You don't know if you went too far or from behind or too far forward. So I think it's something… we need better visibility to be able to come up with a better idea than we currently have it. It's good that there is a rule in place, but at the same time, sometimes it's like luck, to be honest, where you position yourself. No, I think it was… obviously they have more information than us and I think the team did a fantastic job in letting us race. I just felt like there was a point where - I don't know - for the last 10 laps or so that we had very similar pace, within a tenth, faster or slower. And I just felt like the gap, it will have been probably a little bit less or a little bit more. But it wouldn't have changed anything. But I was just thinking about the car, just making sure. I was having some strange vibrations and obviously what happened to Max was in the back of my mind today, and I'm sure he was in the back of the mind of the team as well so it was just a matter of making sure both cars finished to maximise maximum points. Well, reliability is where it is. We saw it today with Aston Martin. It's going to hit us at some point but obviously we need to keep working on that, we need to have the issue races whenever we can. We were in a lucky position in Bahrain but otherwise if we had to push to the end, we probably wouldn't make the race so there are a lot of reliability concerns at the moment but hopefully they don't hit us anytime soon. If that's the case, then it will be fantastic news for the team, because that means that we are pretty far ahead and it comes down to us so it will mean that we are in a great position.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"What a start to the season. I mean, yeah, probably unthinkable one month ago when we launched the car. But yeah, these guys, they made a fantastic car, fantastic execution of the race in Bahrain, and here as well, with the strategy, and the two podiums. Yeah, I need to review obviously. I made that mistake, so yeah, when they told me the five-second penalty I said ‘OK, I need to drive a bit faster to make those five seconds’ but yeah, I need to review. Yeah, it is. It is a hard Grand Prix but yeah, those guys gave me power. Yeah, I pushed all the way through like qualifying laps and yeah, Red Bull is maybe a little bit out of reach but the rest they were behind so happy for that.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it wasn't very easy to get to the field. I mean through the first sector, trying to follow in the beginning of the race was very difficult, a lot of sliding around. But once I cleared them one by one we got into a good rhythm and of course they are very happy to be here on the podium. Yeah, right to the finish but, I mean, I was in second, we had a big gap behind,. so at one point we decided to just, let's say, call it a day and just settle for a second, which I think anyway was a very good recovery you know, so happy with that. I gave it a go at the end, so luckily it worked out. I never really think about it. But yeah, I think realistically with or without the Safety Car, I think P2 was the highest possible. The beginning, the first few laps it was really hard to follow cars because of the street circuit, fast corners, the walls all very close, you get kind-of a tail wind effect. And the car's a bit all over the place. So, after a few laps, it all started to settle in a bit better, and I could pick them off one by one. Then the pace was good. The Safety Car, of course, helped me a bit to get back in the race. But even with that and the restart you just lose too much time to Checo, for example. So, once I got into P2, it was quite a decent gap, let's say like that, on a track where there's not a lot of deg. So I tried to, of course, close the gap a bit. But then, at one point, I picked up again, these vibrations on the driveshaft, on the rear. The team couldn't see anything, but I'm fairly sure there was something odd going on with the balance since the vibration started to kick in. So, at one point, I did the calculations, and I wouldn't have been able to close that gap to the end with only 10 laps left. So, at one point it's, I think, more important to just settle for second: not having an issue with the car. Yeah, but of course, then yesterday in qualifying it just went. It snapped. Today, luckily, didn't do that but it started to have a similar effect on the feeling of driving and what you could hear I hope for a long time. But it's not only about the pace of the car: we need to make sure we are reliable without any issues. I mean, my first weekend was not very clean, because of just the big balance shift from testing to the race weekend, some other things which are going on in the background. And now again, after three positive practice sessions, where then of course, I have an issue in Qualifying. Of course, I recovered to second, which is good. And of course in general, the whole feeling in the team, everyone is happy but personally, I'm not happy. Because I'm not here to be second, especially when you are working very hard also back at the factory to make sure that you arrive here in a good state, and basically making sure that everything is spot on. And then yeah, you have to do a recovery race, which I like – I mean, I don't mind doing it - but when you're fighting for a Championship and especially, you know, when it looks like it's just between two cars, we have to make sure that also the two cars are reliable. Yeah, I think it was a very solid race. I mean, of course, it all helps, we both, I think, have a good feeling with the car. And then around here, I think it's quite a cool track if you have a good balance in the car. So that's nice, when you can push. I mean, I prefer that, of course, over a race where you're just pace-managing all the time. So yeah, those laps were enjoyable up until the point I backed off with the vibrations. With a few laps ago, I asked what the fastest lap was. We were first of all free to race and of course we had a target lap time to the end. It’s a point on the line, it was the same also in Bahrain it got asked so especially when it's just between the two cars, I think it's quite normal that you asked for what the fastest lap is. I haven't seen how much he was out of his box. It is painful when it happens but it's a bit the same with the white line with track limits. Sometimes you argue: did you gain anything going wide or not, going outside of it? I think at one point we do need a rule. It looks really silly if people start to take advantage of going really left and right but yeah, I didn't know what we can do better. The visibility is just really poor in the car, that is I think, probably the main issue where you end up sometimes not fully, correctly in your box. Yeah, we have to do better. Absolutely. But also just have a cleaner weekend. I think that would be nice as well. Well, if that's the case it’s fairly simple, right? We are allowed to race so the best one will finish in front.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
George Russell,"In the UK, when you say wicked, you're meant to do this. We definitely made a step in the right direction. I think, above all, we just truly maximise the potential of the car. We had a really strong Qualifying yesterday, which was really enjoyable. I'd really pleased to come home in P4 on the road because I felt like that was the maximum that was possible. And I was having fun up there. The car was feeling good. And we know we've got some more performance in the locker, in some races to come. I think it was very harsh what happened to Fernando in all honesty, I feel like some of these penalties have been a little bit too extreme, what we've seen this weekend for some drivers that we saw in Qualifying yesterday and for what happened to Fernando. But nevertheless, as I said before, I'm happy to pick up the silverware. It was very chaotic for us because I knew he had a five-second for being out of his grid slot. I didn't realise that he served that during his pitstop in the Safety Car. So, after the restart, had Lewis right behind me, trying to overtake me, and I was like, ‘guys, we need to not fight with one another yet, we need to make sure we save the tyre and we have them at the end, so we can both finish ahead of Fernando with his penalty’. They then told me that he'd already served this penalty, so I was a bit confused and frustrated with that news. And then it was only in the last five laps, I found out that he might be getting a penalty. And that's when I pushed like a madman and just trying to close that gap. But to be honest, I think Fernando and Aston just had pace in their pocket, and they look really solid at the moment. Yeah, I understand why these rules are there. At the end of the day, we've got to stick within the guidelines. I think a little bit of common sense needs to be shown and ultimately, I think he was a bit to the left, was that right? He gained nothing from this. Perhaps a five second (penalty) is too much. And then with regards to his pitstop again, I don't know what happened and why he received the further penalty exactly. But a 10 second is too extreme in that case again. So I'm not too sure it's just making it a little bit, I guess, frustrating for everybody. There's a lot of conversations that were going on this weekend about which lines you could touch, which lines you couldn't touch, especially at the pit exit, and on the pit entry. And then as I said, in qualifying yesterday, we saw a number of cars get laps deleted for touching a bit of the red paint, ending their lap. I just thought that was a little bit senseless, really, so I think we all need to come together and just find a common centre ground. It's incredibly difficult. We're sat so low and to put some perspective, we only see probably the top four or five inches of the tyre so you can't actually see the ground itself. We've got these big long yellow lines pointing out… I can't even see the yellow line, let alone the white lines determining your lateral position. It’s really, really tough so that's why I think in this regard we need to show a little bit more common sense.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"It was tricky. It was tricky that Q3, especially [after] not getting that second lap. That [first lap] was quite good, you know, it was quite clean, really clean. Nailing that lap, you know, you really feel the Formula 1 cars coming alive in this place and yeah just maximising that lap was very important, you know, because with the issue we had into the final run it was really important as the track was improving. Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's a shame, you know. Max has been really strong the whole weekend. So hopefully tomorrow we can have both cars up there, as you never know, with these cars, you know, reliability issues can hit you at any time. I mean Jeddah, I enjoy it a lot. You know, I think we all… When you have a good car that you can push around this place, you really feel the F1 cars coming alive. And getting a clean, good lap, you know when you nail it. And yeah, that Q3 run one was quite a good jump. I had a good jump from all my previous laps. And that meant that I was able to get the pole, because my second lap, I didn't manage to get it. I just had a front lock going into Turn 1. That has been really tricky. Turn 1 and Turn 2, always starting the lap into 1 and 2, it was so easy just to lose two tenths straightaway there, especially with the low downforce that we're running. And just nailing that combination of corners will require a lot of temperature on our tyres as well, so yeah, just in general, just getting that lap, nailing that lap, was really nice. I think it's just tiny. I went a little bit deep into Turn 4. But no, nothing major. It was already a very clean lap. But I think, yeah, the track was improving, there should have been a little bit more to come. Well, I think just in general, you know. I feel like it will be interesting to see, because some cars are running very high downforce others lower downforce, like us. So it will be very interesting to see tomorrow in the race, what we are able to get through and yeah, that will be very interesting. There's always reliability concerns, especially around this place. It is so easy to make damage to the cars and at the end of the day, there will always be reliability concerns. But hopefully not tomorrow. I think we certainly have a good race car. I think it's where probably we are a little bit better than the competition. But yeah, it depends. Like Fernando says, so many things can happen in a race, you know, but I do expect him to come back. Our car, our race pace, was very strong on Friday, so we'll see. We'll see what… hopefully for the team, we are able to come back and get maximum points because these weekends are very important. The competition, it's only going to get closer. So, to be able to maximise maximum points will be important. Well, I am not going to approach the race tomorrow thinking about Max. First of all, I have to make sure I'm able to keep the lid on the initial laps. And if I'm able to do that, to keep this lion behind, it will be good, because I think I can focus on my race. I haven't had a chance to properly look at it. I was focused mainly on getting my lap done. I think we will certainly have a good look later on. It's a very unique place and yeah, you can really see something that stands out between teammates as well. You know, sometimes your car might not be performing at a very high level, but you are able to get those extra two-tenths from yourself by nailing a perfect lap here.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Ah, happy? Yes and no. On one hand, I think it's been a very difficult weekend in terms of pace for us. But I'm very happy about my lap, I think I put everything in it. It was really, really on the limit. On the other hand, Red Bull are on another planet. And we are struggling a little bit. So we need to keep pushing. But that's what we are doing as a team. Tomorrow is not going to be easy. I have a 10-place grid penalty. So we'll be starting a little bit further back. But we'll focus on the race and hopefully come back in the front as quickly as possible. Yes, the race pace looked quite good. But it's very difficult to compare because in FP2 everybody has a very different programme. So we will see, but it seemed a little bit better. But it's not going to be easy because I feel like everybody is very close in the race pace. Not that much. In the lap, I'm really, really happy. It was really on the limit. On the other hand, I feel like Red Bull are quite far ahead. And that is our goal, to beat them. So there's still a lot of work to do. Having said that, I think it's a bit better than what we expected for this qualifying session. We expected to be a bit further back. But there's a lot of work to do. Well, to be honest, if you ask me to pinpoint one thing, it's very difficult. It's just that we were quite slow. And yeah, just overall grip to be honest. I think our race pace is stronger this weekend. So this is a good thing. Then, I don't know how easy it is going to be to overtake on this track because the midfield seems to be all extremely close in terms of race pace. And if you have a DRS train, then it makes things very difficult. But I'll give my best, try to come back to the front as quickly as possible. And we'll see what happens. Well, I'm starting in the back, so I first need to get to that level before worrying about anything. But let’s say that I haven't seen anything that worries me from George. I think it's more the pace of Red Bull that is very, very impressive. And the Mercedes pace is more or less in line with ours, I think. I think for Carlos, it's definitely possible. He's starting a bit further up. On my side, realistically, I think it’s going to be a bit more difficult, especially once I arrive around the top cars – because there, the race pace is very similar to everybody. The Medium this morning, we did few laps on them just to have a bit more information – but it's not like we sacrifice a lot of our Quali pace for our race pace tomorrow. However, our race pace looks better than Bahrain. So, I think we'll be a bit better on that. But yeah, for me, we are still too far in Qualifying compared to what I would like to be, especially compared to the Red Bull. Yeah, exactly the same. Alpine seems to be very quick, especially coming race day. But yeah, let’s see tomorrow. I don't have any particular plan for beating the Alpine. Well, I think it's, it's impressive, especially after a year off, and second race in a street track – and a very challenging one, probably one of the most challenging of the season – to see him have such a performance, is great. However, it's not really a surprise with what he has shown in the past. I was pretty sure that he was extremely talented. And he has shown that today so it's good. I think the grid is in a really good place at the moment with all the drivers there.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, for sure. I mean, it has been a very good weekend for us. Qualifying was our weakness, or a weak point in Bahrain but today the car seemed to perform very well on one lap. And yeah, let's see tomorrow what we can do from here. Obviously, Charles has a penalty, so we'll start on the first row the grid, so this is just amazing. Yeah, we are confident. I think that the gap or let's say the long run yesterday was affected a little bit by traffic but the car felt very strong. Still, I think the strongest point on the car is the long run pace and how we treat the tyres, so I’m looking forward to it. Yeah, it was good. The thing that probably we didn't improve much from Q2 to Q3. Q2 we were P1 with 28.7, and more or less we repeat the same lap in Q3, so we still miss a little bit that jump from Q2 to Q3 and follow the track evolution. But, yeah, all in all, I think we have to be very happy. We start on the first row of the grid, on the second race, very different circuit compared to Bahrain. So yeah, I think it has been a very positive weekend for the team. I think it did. But probably we were expecting more. To be honest, I think the expectations for the Q1 cut-off and the Q2 cut-off were a bit faster. So the track was not mega fast, let's say, tonight. But the same for everybody. I think we optimised our lap and our package. Our strength so far has been the long runs and how we treat the tyres on the long runs. So yeah. Let's see tomorrow what we can do. I don’t know. I think we are not in that position yet. I think on pure pace, I think Red Bull is in another league. And I think we have to concentrate more on the teams behind. So Ferrari will be very strong. Mercedes, they are strong, and also Alpine, they are fast here. So I think our race is just behind us. But we saw today, Max probably was in his league today in qualifying and he could not complete the qualifying with a mechanical issue apparently, so we will try to take the opportunity for sure. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't want to sound pessimistic but if we see the pace the whole weekend in free practice, we see the Bahrain race, we have to be honest with ourselves and know that Red Bull is a little bit ahead of everyone. So that's not, let's say, the target tomorrow, you know, to fight for the win with Checo. But as I said before, Formula 1 is not exact mathematics, you know, anything can happen and today no one of us will put Verstappen P15, you know, but these things happen sometimes. So, for us, the most important thing is to score points. We are starting both cars in the top five. We try to finish both cars in the top five and keep accumulating points for the Constructors’ Championship. That's the main goal for Aston Martin this year. Yeah, very tight race, I expect. And that will be defined by small details. One will be the start, one will be the tyre management. The other one will be the strategy. And probably the final one will be the luck, because we saw even last year with Checo, you know, how luck and the Safety Car can play a big factor here. So, you know, we have to nail all of these points. I think as a team, we are ready to take care of everything that is in our hands. The car seems to perform well on the long runs. Seems very easy on tyres, as we saw also last year with the old Aston Martin, but also in Bahrain, it seems good. So yeah, let's try to maximise our strengths. And hopefully be lucky as well. Yeah, I think so. I think Max will come eventually in the race, you know. They have this advantage. I don't know which race it was last year that he started last, so he changed the power unit and still finished P2 or even won the race. So, I think tomorrow, there is no doubt that he will be in the podium, probably, minimum. So yeah, as I said, this is not our goal. You know, when we launched the car on the 13th of February, I remember very well a conversation with Mike Krack, with Lance, with the senior management of the team, setting the goals for this year, and the goals were not fighting Red Bull for the win tomorrow. So let's keep it simple. Let's keep the feet on the ground, and don't make any mistakes, you know. Even if we are competitive we cannot leave these kinds of weekends that they are so good for us with no points, you know, that would be our biggest mistake. So whatever is available tomorrow, I'm sure we will take. I feel good. Obviously, I came to Jeddah with some question marks about our performance in Bahrain. It was very good – but we did our winter testing in Bahrain and race one in Bahrain, we didn't test the new ’23 cars in any other circuit, so it was important to come to Jeddah and see if we kept being strong in the order. So, you know, to feel competitive again, here, obviously, is a huge relief for the team. And this is, again, an extra motivation for everyone in the factory to keep pushing – because the car seems to perform in any conditions. And then for the first row, I don't think, as I said already on Thursday, I don't think, you know, two Red Bulls are on the first row tomorrow. I think they are very different. Red Bull said that the cars were the same, but they are very different. And also Toto said that the cars were the same: the Mercedes and the Aston because we share 50 per cent of the car or something like that. But it seems that everyone is an Aston Martin now. Yes, I am the same. We know that they are very close, and George particularly, he was very fast here last year as well. I think we were faster than him in practice and Qualifying and then in the race he was very, very strong in 2022. So yeah, I think tomorrow is going to be very close with him and, as I said before, with Alpine as well. So, it’s going to be tight. I mean, nothing really that we will have to do specifically to them. I think we have to concentrate on our race and let's see what is possible. You know, if they are faster than us, and they finish in front of us, that's something that maybe it's not in our hands. What we have to do is not make any mistake and execute the race to perfection. And that perfection, if it’s enough to finish in front of some of these teams, okay, if it’s not enough we will try to improve for the next one. I mean, same. We didn't have much time to really look at the other’s performance. But yeah, Oscar, you know, I think there is nothing new. He has this huge talent. Very tricky place. So, I'm happy for him and happy for McLaren as well. We need, you know, a strong McLaren as well in the fight.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah. Thank you. First of all, I think congrats to Lance, my team-mate, you know, he had the surgery 12 days ago and now he's fighting right with everybody. So yeah, amazing for the team. It was a great weekend and, yeah, finishing on the podium in the first race of the year, this is just amazing, you know, what Aston Martin did over the winter to have the second best car in race one, this is just unreal. Yeah, obviously, I would love to start in front of them and then use the pace. But yeah, we had not the best start today and we had to pass on track. So yeah, it felt like more exciting, more adrenaline for sure. So people enjoyed it. We did enjoy as well. So let's go into Jeddah. I hope so. But we will not get much next year! It is! Obviously, a perfect start for this project. We didn't expect to be that competitive. I think the aim in 2023 was, you know, getting the mix in the midfield, maybe leading that midfield and get close to the top three teams eventually. But even a podium maybe was not in the radar in 2023. And, and we found ourselves second best car today in Bahrain, or the whole weekend, like just behind Red Bull. So, this is, yeah, a little bit of a surprise. But we are extremely proud, happy with the job done at Silverstone in the factory. So big congratulations to everyone. Let's enjoy this moment and build from here, hopefully a good 2023 campaign and get closer and closer to the top guys. Let's see. I think, like, I have the same feeling from testing, like, too good to be true. And you're always expecting that something will get… you will get a step back and you will get back to reality. But it seems real, the performance. Let’s see in Jeddah. I am curious to go to Jeddah and Australia. Very different circuits. I think Max touched on before, high-speed corners, very little degradation. I think in Bahrain, we were strong in things that maybe we don't find in Jeddah, and Australia. So, if we are strong in the next two races, I think we will have a very good 2023. I obviously did enjoy them because I ended-up in front. That’s always the same thing in any battle. But yeah, we say it’s always the same, but when you fight at the front, with these great drivers, great champions, it is more intense, more adrenaline when you are wheel to wheel. So yeah, I didn't want to have any mistake, or any contact because obviously when you are P12, you lose nothing, but today, we were fighting for big things. And yeah, I was happy. And the car was very nice to drive. That was probably our strength, all through testing. And this weekend, even though the race felt very long, the last 10 laps, because I wanted to see the chequered flag and being on the podium, the car was very good to drive and I could have driven for another hour or something, just alone on track. Yeah, apparently into Turn 4. I thought it was George. But I saw the replay on TV later on, and it was Lance. So yeah, he had a very good start because, you know, he was alongside me into Turn 4. We got lucky. Obviously the two cars, they didn't have any problems and we could continue. It was our lucky day. For many things, you know, for this contact, and also to be both cars with strong points. So, I'm very happy for the team because they deserve it. No. But, you know, we had a very comfortable position. So, I slowed down the pace and I informed the team that you know, I could go faster, but I was avoiding the kerbs and just bringing the car home. So yeah, I mean, there are a couple of areas that we have to improve that I will not share. But I think the most important point is that the new Aston Martin is just a new car, a new project. This is just the beginning. You know, this is not the final car, this is just the starting car of this concept that we changed over winter. I think some of the top teams they just kept the philosophy that they had last year. Red Bull or Ferrari they kept more of the same shapes. Just, fine-tuning things and making perfection of that good baseline that they had. For us, it was much more difficult. We have to change 95% of the car. So, I guess there is more to learn from the car, and there is more to come on our side. So full trust in our team, obviously they know what they do. So let’s hopefully improve soon. Yeah, I think we were not very fast on the straight. So, eventually you normally pass into Turn 1 or into Turn 4. And I think I pass Lewis into Turn 10 and Carlos into Turn 11. So not the normal places, because we could not match their straight-line speed. So, yeah, we had to make some moves in the corners before Turn 10 and Turn 11 and change trajectory, and then get the overtake done, I think to Lewis was more playing a surprise move there, because no one overtakes into Turn 10, let's say. And then with Carlos, it was close into Turn 10 again, he closed the door, and then I have a better exit into Turn 11. But, yeah, we need to see that because obviously, we will love to pass just on the main straight like everyone does. I think on the tyres, yes. It seems that this is one is strength of our car, some legacy from last year as well, because Aston Martin was very strong on Sundays last year as well. So yeah, let's try to keep that theme on the car and just improve the Saturdays, which was maybe the weak point of last year for the team. And also yesterday, we were not mega-competitive. So let's work on that. And yeah, on the race pace, obviously we lost time in the first stint. I just sat behind the Mercedes. In the middle stint I have to pass George and Valtteri. And then on the final stint I had to pass Lewis and Carlos. So, all in all, I'm sure that you lose 10 or 15 seconds on all those battles. So if we are 40 seconds behind the leader, we could have been maybe 20 seconds, or 30 seconds. Yeah, not real fight – yet – to Red Bull. I think we know what is causing that, but I will keep it for me. We're still working. As I said, the car is very new. We need to learn more from the car, I need to get used to the car. So those moments were more coming from me getting used to the car, getting used to the driving input, feedback from the steering wheel and power assistance. So things that they are not 100% tailormade yet. Yep. I would say yes because when you are P3 in race one, there are 22 opportunities this season. And even last year, I remember in Canada, wet qualifying, we were in the first row of the grid. You know, anything can happen in 22 races with different conditions. And, you know I will try my best to do have the opportunity. Maybe we need some help. Last year, we needed some help from the top teams just to get the podium. Maybe this year, if there is this help or there is some retirements in front of us or some problems maybe it's more than a podium. So let's hope for that. I think 2013. Yeah, we were leading the championship, I think, after Barcelona. So we had a contender package but after that I think I didn't feel as good as now. I don't think so. No. I think you need to have the vision and the ambition of Lawrence Stroll, or our leadership and our management because the opportunities are there for everybody but it seems that only one team is willing to do whatever it takes to win. And you know, I'm proud to be part of this organisation. A double DNF would be nice.",Bahrain,post-race,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah it’s a great start. I mean, when we look back at last year, and how we started here, it’s really nice. It's a nice comeback. As a team, you know, we worked really hard over the winter. So it's great to see all the boys enjoying the first race. And yeah, we have a strong package. So yeah, it was important today to get both cars until the end. Well, I think today was really that start that really put me out of contention from the race. But it was all about minimising the damage. So finishing second is the maximum I could do today. It's a long season. I think I'm getting closer every single session. Yeah, certainly. I think I'm feeling comfortable with the car and we have a strong package. So, yeah, I will do my best. Yeah, that was really the case, missing out to Charles on that first stint. It was really difficult to get by him. He had the new tyres. So you could see the difference on that first stint. And as soon as I was getting a bit closer to him, trying to attack him earlier on, I will just deg and destroy my tyres. So I had to be really patient and get my way through it. And once he did, I was able to drive some fast laps and, let's say, that my tyres and on the second stint were in better shape than his and I was able to get through. But yeah, it was just too late. It was just a few laps too many, too late, and that put us quite behind Max. Once that happened, we basically just maintained the gap throughout the race. So we had no chance to fight for the win. But today was all about minimising the bad start. And we've got plenty of things to analyse, to try to improve and get this consistency throughout the season. Yeah, I actually learned a lot about their car, you know: where they are weak, where they're strong, or stronger than us. So yeah, I think I need to make sure that it stays fresh for my engineers later in the briefing. Yeah, I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable with the car. I'm happy. I think we’ve got some work to do. I think we, both drivers are pushing the car in the same direction, which is good. And yeah, I think it's been an amazing start to the season. Yeah, our best ever start ever, so very different to last year. Oh, it's nice to see three Red Bull cars on the podium! We are all Red Bull drivers. I'm first of all very happy to see Aston and Fernando up here. I think it's been a tremendous effort and it’s great to see Fernando in his first race for the team on the podium. I think they certainly have a very good car. They will be a contender for sure in a few tracks. You know that the seasons in Formula 1 are extremely long, so anything can happen. So yeah, it's just nice to see Fernando and Aston. Nothing more to add. Yeah, I basically lost the position to Charles and that very much defined my race. As I say, he was very strong on that first stint and every time I could get close to him, I was just taking off my tyres so it was very important for me to get to lap 15/16 and still having a good tyre which I could push and make a bit of a tyre delta so I could get by him and once that happened, Max was just too far down the line.",Bahrain,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a very, very good first stint, where I basically made my gap. And from there onwards it was all about just looking after the tyres, because you never really know what's going to happen later on in the race. So we just wanted to make sure that we had the right tyres and in good condition as well. So yeah, of course, very happy to finally also win here in Bahrain. Nothing big, just little things you always want to fine tune so I think they're quite easy to get on top of. Very, very different. I think we have a good race package. I mean, of course it will depend a bit, race to race, but we can definitely fight with this. And yeah, also a big thank you to the team, you know, over the winter what they've done again, to give us such a quick race car again. Yeah, I mean, it was a really good race. I do think it was important to have that first stint where I could open up a gap a little bit and after that I could look after my tyres quite well. But also the car was working well – a bit like what we've seen in testing and the long runs we've done throughout the weekend. But you still of course need to show that in the race. You never know really what can happen to you throughout the race. But yeah, we were on top of things. And it was quite straightforward. But yeah, I think also, with all the calls and pit stops, we did a good job. Yeah, but you know, in the long run, you anyway have quite a different car, and you never really are able to push to the limit. So naturally, that was less of an issue anyway, when I was already not happy in the beginning of the weekend. But I do think that there are still a few things that need to be looked at. But for now, we're happy. And then tomorrow, once we get back home, we'll get on top of everything before we get to Jeddah. It happens here and there. I mean, this is not something new. This has happened also in the last year or two years. This is something we are consistently working on and trying to make better. But yeah, I think overall, nothing too big of a concern. Well, Saudi is quite a different track to this one. You have a lot more like straights, fast corners, and a lot less deg. And I think here we were particularly good on the deg. So I do expect in terms of race pace that everyone is closer in Jeddah. It has been a great start for us, for the for the whole team, you know, so this is not something we were used to! So yeah, we are very happy at the moment. But yeah, we always keep working. Yeah, I think I already said before that the one lap performance to the race is very different in balance requirements anyway. So even like I said before, on Friday, I was unhappy with the one lap performance, my long runs were still okay, so not really surprised. I'm just, of course, happy that it worked out like this but Jeddah is going to be quite different again. Our car seems quite strong in high speed but you're right, I think Ferrari is quite quick on the straight which in Jeddah, of course, is very nice to have, let's say like that. But yeah, time will tell. It's really hard to know.  We've only really driven these cars here in Bahrain so we just have to wait and see. We’ll, of course, try and get there in the best shape possible and then we'll find out throughout practice where we are exactly. I hope so for Fernando as well because he has had a few years where there was not really a possibility to fight at the front so I'm happy to see him sitting here already in race one. I think also again, I mentioned it before, but at Aston Martin they really have the spirit and drive, they want to win and they've hired a lot of good people. So I guess it can only get better for them. And I think for this year, difficult to say if they're going to challenge for the championship, but race wins are definitely on the table. I've been in the same position where some races I'm finishing 20 to 40 seconds behind the winners and you still win two or three races a year because sometimes they are some tracks which really suit your car and everything just comes together and you can win a race with maybe sometimes a bit of help or luck. But for sure they have a really strong package. And now of course it's all about developing it further. Yeah, Fernando's absolutely right.  I think you mentioned all of it and I think it doesn't matter if it was the previous generation or this one. I think if you have the right people in charge, and they really want to win and they hire the right people, anything is possible. Well, last year was very disappointing, of course. That normally was a P2. I do think our mentality also has changed a bit compared to a few years ago, in terms of how we are operating and how we are developing a car. And yeah, it's great to finally have a car which is able to win from the start. And it also helps the car's not so overweight. It's perfectly fine now. But yeah, this is a great start but we also know that throughout the season you have to keep on developing. Of course, we are on that, but we hope of course that's going to be more than the other teams because you have to try and keep that advantage going.",Bahrain,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"No, there wasn't any issue. I think we were in a fight for pole, which was a good surprise, to be honest, because I did not expect that after testing and after the free practices that were a little bit difficult. We managed to find that pace for the quali lap, which was great. However, we need to keep in our mind that in the race run we seem to be a little bit on the back foot compared to Red Bull. And I think we are in a better place starting third with new tyres than starting first with old, or a bit further up [than third]. I don't know if we will have gotten pole or not. But it would have been close. Yes. I hope it will also be like that on the race runs. But yeah, it was very, very close actually. Aston Martin was really quick. Mercedes, also, was really quick at some points of the qualifying. And we are much closer than what we expected, which is looking good for the future. I think it makes Formula 1 more exciting. So I'm looking forward to the rest of the races. Well, again, let's say that in the race run we seem to have a bit of a weakness for now. Having a new tyre will help us tomorrow. But I don't know how much the picture will change with that. But it’s going in the right direction at least. I don't know. Definitely not as much as… I didn't find it myself. And I'm not aware of it. I mean, we found a lot of performance in Qualifying. But I mean, ‘a lot of performance’, we were in the fight, which is something that I probably did not expect. So, it's a good surprise. To tell you where we found the performance, I'm not really sure, so we need to look into that. Because as much as we need to understand the bad days, I think we also need to understand the good days. That's how we will improve but good that it's like that. But we also need to be realistic. I mean, those guys, and also Aston Martin, seems to be really, really quick in the race. Which is why I think, we made that choice in Q3 to be willing to lose one or two positions at the start, but having new tyres to put all the chances on our side, which I'm sure is the right choice. But let's see tomorrow. I mean, I hate saying yes, it will have been or… I mean, it's difficult to say but for sure, seeing the margin on the first set, I knew there was a bit of time to find. So, it will have been close. They are quick, they are really quick. Hopefully we have another good surprise tomorrow. Of course, for now, we don't know in which conditions they were running in FP2 when they were doing the race simulations. Looking at FP2, they are very quick. I don't think so. I haven't seen the team but I was told on the radio that it was all fine. The part I honestly don't know. Because I haven't seen any images of it whatsoever. Yeah, probably! But the lock-up I think was just me being too optimistic in braking for Turn One. I don't think it's… I mean, I didn't feel anything particularly weird. No, I think we are only happy if we win. But again, realistically, they seem to be very, very quick. So I think in those weekends where we are a little bit underneath, that's exactly those weekend that we need to maximise and, and try to get what we can in terms of points. So yeah, if a win is possible tomorrow, I will go for it. If not, we'll try and get the maximum points. Yeah, for the field closer, I will probably wait and see tomorrow so in the race pace, but in qualifying for sure, it seems that we are all closer, which I think is great. It's more exciting and qualifying sessions like Q1 and Q2, which for us, for the top teams, whenever we had that big margin we could do a little bit of whatever we want. Now it seems to be a bit more on the limit so it's nice. Oh, they've shown a very promising race pace in FP2, but again, FP2,  it's very difficult to judge because you don't know the fuel level they had in the car. But I think they will be strong in the race, probably quicker than what they've shown in qualifying, even though they were pretty close. But yeah, let's wait and see tomorrow. Again, the goal is to always try and improve. I think we improved our process of… throughout the race trying to take care more of these tyres but if I look in FP2 we are still quite a bit slower than Red Bull in terms of pace and tyre degradation. So we still need to see tomorrow and see where we are exactly but if we focus on ourselves, yes, I feel like we have done a step forward but I'm not sure it's enough. Well, a bit more grip but yeah, I don't know if it will be a game changer. Yeah, I don't feel there was a need for change for that but let's try and see.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I mean, it has been a really tight qualifying. I don't remember such a tight qualifying battle from Q1 to Q2, you know, the competition it’s really marginal. So you cannot leave anything on the table to maximise your grid position. In the end I wasn't totally comfortable with the balance. I believe, certainly, that you can always improve a tenth on your lap. But I think to get this start for the team is really special. Yeah, if anything, we prepared much more to do the race. You know, we have more of a Sunday race car at the moment underneath us. We knew we had to do some compromises for quali, which we ended up doing. They were not ideal, but hopefully tomorrow it pays out and we can have a very strong race car. Just like Max said, you know, the balance has been really different from testing. We've done plenty of kilometres here but we came to the race weekend and we found a very different balance to testing. So, we've been working our way through, we've been making massive changes from one side to the other. I think in the end, we knew we had to compromise a bit the quali-pace for tomorrow’s race. So hopefully that will pay out tomorrow. Generally, I wasn't that comfortable with my balance in Qualifying. But I think, as I progress, I was able to learn my way around the balance I had and get a good Q3 lap in the end, but not enough to beat Max. Well, I wouldn't go too much in detail. It’s just that we found quite a different car to what we had in testing and we don't understand what’s the reason behind it: could be wind; the relative temperature; many variants that I think after the weekend, we will have a bit more of an idea. But for now, we’ve got a focus for tomorrow. As far as I know, it's the same. Well, the Ferraris definitely picked up throughout. I think there were sandbagging a bit through the first days of testing and in during the weekend. They're definitely there. They're very strong. So, I will expect them to be in the fight for tomorrow's race. And you can already see, you know, that it is not only Red Bull and Ferrari there are plenty of other teams that have joined the competition. So, I mean, if you don't get a perfect lap in Q2, Q1, you really have to put more tyres on, so yeah, the competition has increased certain for this season. Yeah, certainly the competition is a lot closer now. You can see it straight from Q1. You cannot do a mistake, even if you are in a top car. So yeah, that's nice in a way. And  it will only get closer as the season progresses. So we welcome the competition. Well, they've been really strong, in the conditions yesterday, today so yeah, definitely expected them to be around us and obviously for tomorrow they will be a threat so it will be very close battle I think with a few cars racing each other throughout the race and you know, if there is a safety car at the right time for you, then it can change the story with this track  that is pretty high deg. Yeah, they're very good on tyres. I know John is really good guy, and they're very good. They generally have been really strong. I think that’s one of the strongest points of them. They rely a lot on that. The way they operate when I was there, it was always biased to the race weekend so I think tomorrow we can expect a very strong Aston Martin. Yeah, just think it’s for the show. I think we don't need that when you see the qualifying we had today, how close everything was.  We do not really need to change anything. But we'll see, we'll see once we try it but I don't think there's a need to change something that is working well.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. I hope he was watching. I'm pretty sure he was watching. But yeah, I think it's been a bit of a tough start to the weekend yesterday and today, not really finding my rhythm. But luckily, in qualifying, I think we managed to put the best pieces together. And, of course, very happy to be on pole, and for the whole team, coming off of last year and again having such a strong car with Checo up there as well. Yeah, it's amazing. And I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Well, I think compared to last year everyone knows a bit more what they're doing with the car. So naturally, I think you already start off better and more competitive. And then, yeah, the changes I think slowed down the car bit, but we are still going faster. So that's of course a great thing to see. And I think again, you know, throughout the year, you will see that everyone is increasing their performance again, a lot and that's the beautiful thing about Formula 1. I was actually positively surprised being on pole after the struggles I had in practice. So that's positive and normally our race car is better. So let's see. I’m particularly happy because my whole weekend up until qualifying was very difficult. I couldn't really find the comfortable balance I had in testing and I was just struggling a lot to just get the car together, really. I went into Q1 and everything already felt a bit better, but it was still not, let's say, perfect. So yeah, I'm very happy then in Q3 that we could put these laps in. I still think it's not perfect, but in a better direction. So, for sure, for the next race we will have to analyse a bit why from the test to the race weekend it's so different for us, and also for me driving wise. But nevertheless, we are sitting here with two cars. So coming off last year I think this is again a very strong start for us. So yeah, very happy with that. A lot. I went left and right and back to the middle and found a bit of a compromise. So that's a bit unusual that you make such big changes. But, like I said, luckily in qualifying that's probably the best balance I've had throughout the weekend so far. Yeah, the laps were good. Yeah, you come out of qualifying and you always immediately analyse your lap, right? And yeah, overall, pretty pleased. That should normally be our stronger point than the one-lap pace. So hopefully we can show that again tomorrow. Maybe you found a sandbag in the car? It was the sandbag. Yeah, I mean, after testing I was very happy and then then I jumped in the car in FP1 and it was a big shock. I just couldn't get the balance right through all the practice sessions. And that's why I think what we achieved in qualifying was very good. I mean, qualifying to race is anyway a different car in terms of how it behaves, but you still want to be quick over one lap and that was a big struggle for me. Yeah, we just need to analyse everything what got onto the car for the race weekend, even if it's the same part but new, just to check everything for next weekend again. They are all very close to us. Of course, we have shown really good race pace but we still need to show that tomorrow, and a lot of things can happen also during a race, which sometimes is not in your control. So yeah, we just, of course, need to focus on ourselves and try to do the best we can. And hopefully no crazy things will happen. Not really a surprise. If you look at most of the cars, they all copied each other so everyone is getting smarter over the years anyway, with the same regulations. And if you see that one car, particularly, is doing quite well over a year, you'll try to copy some things and that's why of course, naturally everyone is getting closer and in general, of course, understanding the car bit better. Yeah, for sure, they look very competitive. And I think already not only this year but last year. Their car was maybe not that amazing but I think in race pace, they were always quite strong compared to their competitors. So they probably took that also into this year. So for sure, they will be very competitive in the race, but a bit difficult to tell. But again, like I said before, a lot of things can happen throughout the race, with certain safety car moments or whatever, you need to make the right calls at the right time as well. You don't even need to have the fastest car then of course to win Everyone said we don't need an out lap so it should be okay. I hope it's not going to be cold in Imola, otherwise it's going to be quite tricky but yeah, it’s the same for everyone but I don't think we need to actually do these kinds of things in qualifying. I don't really see the benefit of it. It's better if we make sure that all the cars are close to each other and more competitive instead of spicing things up in that way, which I think is probably for the show.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, feels good. I think it's always the same feeling for race one, where you obviously prepare over the winter, and we have less and less testing these days and you feel maybe not 100% ready with the car, especially if you change team. You need a little bit more time to adapt to many new things. But it's the same for everybody. So let's go. Yeah. I mean, you never know what the others are doing, so basically you concentrate on your programme. And let's see after this race, basically after Jeddah or Australia, I think very different circuits, where I think you will see more where everybody is. But yeah, I think we aimed to make a step forward compared to last year. Obviously, Aston Martin went through some difficulties with the car and some things that they discovered throughout the 2022, so I think this year we have a better baseline, and we are happy so far. I think this is a very ambitious project. What I’ve found is very talented people, people who want to succeed, want to win in the near future. So that was a very nice surprise and you know everyone is pushing in the same direction, knowing how difficult it is going to be the task. But, as I said, I think ambition is the word. I don't know. Difficult to say right now. Yes, that's the good thing about experience. I will be the only one. I think I raced on that layout for a few years, but I don't know, with these cars, how it's going to feel. Some of these guys probably they've been testing in winter with old cars there. So maybe they can give you an update on this. No privileged. Privileged to still drive here, better than ever. I have no concerns on age yet. I will be the first one to feel it, when I lose something, when I miss something while driving or not being motivated to travel or to wake up in the morning and train or just come here for testing like last weekend. So far I only see advantages because I know this track in many different conditions. I know the car, I know the tyres. As I said before, some of the circuits that we will drive this year I've been driving already in the past so yeah, I don't see a disadvantage. It gives always, because you meet new people, new philosophies of racing, you know, how they approach the weekends and the car design and so on. But at the same time, it gives you an extra challenge, for sure, when you have to learn everything from zero and make the new seat, all these things that normally if you stay with the same team winters are a little bit more relaxed. Well, I think they are very different things. So I don't know exactly what Lance has, and it’s a private thing that you can ask him. And he will check on the car, obviously. I think it’s already very good news that he's here and he will try. That shows, you know, his desire to win and his motivation to win with this team one year, and you know, this is even fighting for whatever position we can achieve this weekend – he's here and ready to try it. So that's a very good sign. In my case, yes, I broke few bones in both hands last year, so until August, I was not fully recovered. I had some pain, but we love driving. I think so. I think we are getting better as a sport in many, many areas. And I think on this topic, there is always never enough. But I think we have a good leadership right now. And we are in good hands. So I think we are moving in the right direction. Yes. Oscar. Daniel Kvyat, Carlos, Lando. Yeah, a few of them. No, I don't know. As I said before, I didn't change my thoughts in the last seven minutes. So, I have no idea where are we in terms of a position but, I don't know, this car, the aim was to make a step forward, which I think we did. It was very encouraging, the results from the test and the feeling from the car. But this is just the start. This car will change dramatically during the season. That's the plan. Again, I heard from the team that two-thirds from this car will change during the season. So, you know, we want to have a good baseline, a good platform to develop the car during 2023 and maybe fight for something bigger next year. But step by step. There is nothing really to say you know? We will give our best on the race. But doesn’t… that's not the target for us, to be honest. I think we need to keep learning about the car, only one day and a half or two days of testing on a completely new car, new package. And I think the top three teams, they were in another league last year; they were lapping you know, sometimes even the fourth team. And basically, you know, only seven cars finish on the same lap. So, we cannot make that kind of step only in one winter. I think we are very happy with the car. But I think we have to have the feet in the ground and keep working on on this good baseline. Same. I don’t know. Eight? Ten? Five! I don't know. I keep motivated always to compete. Even when I tried to stop Formula 1 in 2018, I couldn't make it and I was in different cars every weekend, with the World Endurance Championship, or Dakar, or Indy or whatever.  So yeah. This. When I came back to Formula 1, for sure, I decided that I had to sacrifice other things in life and dedicate myself for another period of time. Maybe three, maybe five, maybe seven or whatever years, to the sport. So yeah. I don't know. There are no secrets. You know, you dedicate your life to your passion. And yeah, you know your body better as well, so you train better, you eat better. So, you make your career longer. Competition! I will not drive in a test for longer. Yep, sure, I mean, we've been in contact from day one. So Lance was updated on everything during the test. We used to speak with him in lunch breaks and also in the evening sessions. He was at the simulator the last few days as well. So giving us feedback. So yeah, we were on the same page, basically on real time.",Bahrain,thursday,Aston Martin
Nico Hülkenberg,"Not really. I think the approach is similar, but you know, I just feel refreshed, reset, you know, very positive and in a good state of mind, you know, ready to go again. Obviously, I’ve done a couple of seasons, so I know what's coming. I know what to expect. And just really ready and keen to start the thing. I haven't noticed any change so far, to be honest. And I doubt that there will be a big difference in feeling. Yeah, that's all I can say. Awareness now, it's very much the same. So let's see how it goes after a couple of races. Firstly, you know in testing it's important for driver to kind of connect with the car, to have a good feeling with it. To build a good foundation and harmony. And I feel that’s what I've done and achieved in the limited time, like for us all. That feeling is obviously going to grow better and stronger race by race, because testing was not huge. I think the midfield is very, very competitive and tight once again. We say that every year but it's actually always the case and small things I think can have a big impact and make a big difference. I believe we were somewhere in the midfield as well. It can be very track-dependent if you're the upper end or the lower end, but yeah, it's our job obviously to maximise what we have and score results. It's going to feel great. Oh we are rubbing. Rubbing and tugging and hugging and everything. We actually, you know, sort of broke the ice here 12 months ago when I stepped in for Seb. There's this driver picture on Sunday morning and we happened, you know, to be standing behind each other and I sort of, you know, [thought] it's time to break the ice and reached out with a hand and with a smile and put his words into his face. And that's where our relationship actually started, 12 months ago, and ever since, you know, it's actually been pretty good. We've been hanging out a bit over the winter, in the UK, doing some marketing and media stuff. And yeah, so far, so good. I feel no tension or friction between us. He's a dad, too. So we're both in similar positions in our life. And looking forward to working alongside him. I think they don't need advice. I think they all know what they're doing. Obviously, they've all done the junior stuff. This is just the biggest stage. But there have been educated to come to this point. But of course, you're going to be probably a bit more nervous than on your usual day. But it's the start of a long journey for most of them. It's a long road. It’s a big learning curve, a big process. So yeah, all the best and enjoy. Well, if you’re not motivated in your first year, I think then there’s a serious issue in the first place. Obviously, that's you know, first year you're still young, you've been through all the junior series, you've been fighting to get where you want to and then you finally reach your first goal which is to be in F1, to be on the grid. So even if you don't have the best car, which is almost never the case for anyone, you still just out there, giving it your everything, fighting for every bit of tarmac, trying to obviously leave a good mark and do some great advertising for yourself to change that very fact.",Bahrain,thursday,Haas
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, definitely. It's been about I think 12 years since I started racing. So everything up until that point has led to now. So yeah, to be calling myself a Formula 1 driver and preparing for my first race is a special feeling, definitely. Yeah, I think having that year out I definitely gained a newfound appreciation for how much I enjoy going racing. Even in the bad times it's still better to have those bad times than have no times at all, I learned. So yeah, I think I've come back with probably more hunger, I would say, than previously. And now that we're here on the grid, it's just a great feeling. And I'm looking forward to getting stuck in. Long-distance racing. I don't know how you do that. Do you mean like sim racing? Oh, endurance racing! Sorry, I thought you meant like long-distance relationship racing. I was really confused! Anyway, don’t worry! I did some testing last year, like quite a lot of testing by myself on track. But it's obviously not the same as having other people around you. It's hard to be in a competitive environment. I did a bit of sim racing here and there, on my sim at home, but it's very hard to replicate the real thing without properly going racing. So, yeah, I tried what I could But yeah, I'm looking forward to going back this weekend. I think we're, like Nyck and Nico said, we’re probably somewhere amongst them. Obviously, the test wasn't the smoothest. But I think you know, we'll get a better understanding of where we're at come tomorrow. And yeah, I think we're somewhere in the midfield. And we'll see exactly where we are on Saturday night. No, I didn't. I think it will be close. It's a fast couple of corners. I did try that layout a little bit. Yeah, for me, it's much better than the last chicane, it was was quite a slow, clunky sector. So I think going back to those last two corners it's definitely going to add some excitement. And for me, it's a much better layout. Yeah, I think for me, it's a privilege to race against Fernando obviously. I grew up watching him. My first go-kart ever was a Fernando Alonso kart, actually. I've also worked with him quite closely last year, as well. So yeah, for me, it's a privilege to race against him. On paper, sounds a little bit strange to be starting… For Fernando's career to be longer than I've been alive but yeah, it's a big privilege to race against someone like Fernando. I think the relationship with Lando has been good so far. I think we've both got very similar ideas on what we need to improve. So, I think in terms of a working relationship, it's been very good. Obviously, he's got a bit more experience in Formula 1 and with the team as well. So yeah, naturally that helps with the direction of the team in the car, but I feel like we're both making very similar comments, which is good. And yeah, we've been getting along well, we've done a fair bit of marketing activity together in Papaya, as the team at McLaren will correct you, so yeah, it's been good so far and I think we'll have a good working relationship as well. Not yet. But if it's in my best interest to be on Zak and Lando’s good side, I should probably start. I think similar to Logan. At the moment, we’re obviously incredibly busy betting ready for our first F1 race. I think the issues are obviously incredibly important and need to be spoken about at the right time, and addressed. But I think at the moment, though, yeah, I think we've probably all got our hands very full with what we've got. But when the time is right, of course, we'll speak about these important issues.",Bahrain,thursday,McLaren
Logan Sargeant,"Well, obviously, as Nico said, it's on a much bigger stage. But other than that, I feel like it's really just business as usual. Now, it's a bit more juggling preparation and media. But to be honest, you know, I feel very happy with where I was in the test. And I feel comfortable in the car. I feel like I've laid a good foundation and a base to work from so I'm relatively relaxed heading into tomorrow. It was a lot of laps. But to be honest, I feel like that just gave me more confidence of you know, the work that I put in over the off-season to physically be ready for this moment. And, you know, to get through a day and a half, two hundred and something laps completely unfazed was a good feeling. And yeah, leaves me in a good head space going into the season. Yeah, you know how drivers are, they keep a little bit to themselves. But no, I think he's probably the most open and honest teammate I've ever had. Super nice to work with. Obviously, a lot of experience and super quick. So it's also really good reference for me. But within the team, I feel like it's such a healthy environment, everyone's working towards the same goal. And, yeah, I feel like I'm part of the family after the past year and a half. I think from my side, as you said, we are extremely busy getting ready for the season, trying to be as well-prepared as we can be. And at the moment, that has to be my main focus. And, you know, I think these issues do you need to be addressed and it's something that I necessarily don't always have all the facts to. So, at the moment, it's just focusing on the races.",Bahrain,thursday,Williams
George Russell,"I guess the mood in the camp is good. It was a good test, we learnt a lot. I think we learned that obviously Red Bull are looking really, really strong. But equally, we feel like we've got a lot of room that we can improve. Probably brought up a little bit more pace this weekend after the learnings of testing. But it's going to be for sure a challenging weekend if we want to try and fight for that victory. But we probably knew that ahead of season, starting off where we do. Yeah, I think the fact is, we'll find out this weekend where we fall out. I think testing is obviously a good indication for all of us. But the fact is, until we get to qualifying, and we get to the race, we'll have no idea. And I think some teams were surprising, how their performance was. I think some teams were very fast on a single lap. Some teams look faster in the long run. But I think it's important to remember we all try and design a car that's fastest across the 23 race season and Bahrain is definitely a bit of an outlier. So, I don't think the picture of this weekend will be the full picture for the whole season. I mean, it probably wasn't the smoothest three days we could have hoped for. But I think the lessons we learned from the test… I went back to the to the UK I was on the simulator and the learnings, the findings we found I think is going to put us in better stead for this weekend. But I think it's definitely fair to say Red Bull are in a bit of a league of their own this weekend here in Bahrain, but I think it would probably be a nice fight for second place, probably between Ferrari and Aston Martin. Yeah, I think last year was a really good year for development and understanding how a team like Mercedes operates. They work on such a high level, the engineering talent they've got there is exceptional and I feel fortunate being in a team such as this. So it's a new year, new challenges, new opportunities and looking forward to see what we can we can do this year. Absolutely. Yeah, I think the way you saw our development last year with Mercedes was pretty, pretty spectacular over the course of a year. I think even the improvements we're going to probably bring to the car this weekend compared to the test will take us a step closer. But as I said, it's a very unique circuit here in in Bahrain. I'll be surprised if the gaps are that large at other circuits but you know, I trust in our team and if we develop at the same rate as we did last year, we're definitely starting from a higher point. But I think the good thing is here there's not too many races at the start of the season so it gives us some time to develop in the windtunnel and back at the factory to fight for when the main block of races come. Yeah, nothing more to add, really. Naturally, everybody's always looking for more downforce. And I think the tricky thing with these new regulations of cars… is trying to get the car as low as possible and gaining that downforce, probably being a little bit more efficient in the straight line Red Bull have been very strong generally speaking in their drag, I think we may have made a small step improvement this weekend so I hope that is reflected in the speed traps and that's almost a bit of free lap time. But you know, I think we need to trust in our process. Mercedes have built a World Championship-winning car for eight seasons in a row. We've still fundamentally got all of the same guys there and they haven't just forgotten how to build a fast race car. I think we were obviously on the backfoot following the challenges of the W 13 but I absolutely believe as the season progresses, we're definitely going to close that gap. And there's no reason why we can't fight as the season hots up. Yeah, obviously, early days, but Mick’s really integrating well into the team. He's really willing. He's helping wherever possible. He was out on track quite a lot last week, just watching and analysing how the cars seemed off track and feeding that back into engineers and doing the necessary work in the simulator. So he's been a real benefit, a real help to us. And yeah, I hope he gets his chance back in Formula 1 next year, but if he keeps on putting in the work, he will get that opportunity again, for sure. That's a very challenging question, I think. You know, when we look at where we were this time last year, we had so many problems with the car that we didn't know how to resolve. We thought we'd resolve them a little bit quicker than we did, maybe after six races we thought we would resolve them but realistically, it took until probably Austin maybe, until we took a big step forward. And now we're starting from a base which is fundamentally a lot better than we were last year. So I think, if we managed to achieve a race win last year, starting from such a low, low point, there's no reason why we can't achieve more victories but as I said, it's a relative game. Red Bull are looking really strong and we've got a little bit of catching up to do. Yeah, I think those stats against a guy like Lewis are pretty, pretty irrelevant. He's achieved 100 and more poles and victories, and last year was a very challenging car to drive. For sure, I was pleased with my own personal performance. I think the qualifying pace was, at the end of the year, we were basically on identical race pace, maybe something I want to improve slightly. And I probably improved that towards the end of the year compared to Lewis, but you know, he's just an animal and he just keeps on fighting. He keeps on going. And you know, he never gives up. So I think he's going to come back fighting even more last year. And yeah, I'm excited to have that challenge. But ultimately, the two of us are looking for the top step of a podium, but not just the number one spot in the team. No, I think we had a really good time between the test and the race to analyse what happened throughout the test. There were a few things going on with the car that we didn't quite expect but we've been able to resolve pretty easily. It was just working in slightly the wrong window. So we'll put that… changing for this weekend, we were running a different rear wing in the Bahrain test just for some correlation work and that wasn't an optimal rear wing for Bahrain either so there's definitely positive signs but I'm not going to sit here saying we're going to find that lap time deficit to Red Bull, but I'm definitely sitting here in a more comfortable place than I probably was on Friday night.",Bahrain,thursday,Mercedes
Zhou Guanyu,"Feels massively different. Obviously compared to George, I think it’s a completely different Year Two, but I really felt like getting to know the people at the team, also getting to know this car, to push the one-lap pace, the race craft has been improved throughout the testing, compared to ’22. And yeah, overall, it’s been quiet few days of testing. This time last year I think I wasn’t too sure about everything, but now I feel more ready than ever – so hopefully it will be a good one. It's more like how to be a complete F1 driver. Because when you watch from outside of the World, even in the other paddock, in F2, you really don’t feel the pressure, that the drivers are feeling these days. So last year is really about a compromise of mental strength, how you faced the outside world, how you face your team. You have to obviously do well on track, and also off track, there's so much stuff you have to take care of. So yeah, it’s always a massive curve of learning progress throughout the season and I really feel like much stronger now. So hopefully continue to grow up and improving. It was a great memory this time, you know finishing first race in the points and that's definitely the target. We felt like we have a package in the team that can be fighting again with the midfield guys. And everyone's very tight like always, with this battle, but it seems to be like we were able to make a step, considering the second half of the season last time. So yeah, definitely the points I think is the minimum target we’re aiming for this weekend and will be nice to, you know, get a top eight finish. That would be amazing. I was in the Jacuzzi. No, I have one in the hotel where we stayed so yeah, we played some padel, some squash, but yeah, unfortunately yesterday I lost every game in the padel. I wasn't. We were going to play but I watched him on the courts and I was like, yes, but I don't join him. Otherwise, I think I'll break some racquets.",Bahrain,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Charles Leclerc,"Well, that's the goal. For sure. They’ve had a strong start, Red Bull, and Max seems to be very, very strong. It's only testing, so it's difficult to quantify by how much but it seems that they are a bit in front, compared to us. So we've got some work to do but it's only the beginning. But the goal is definitely to go one better. I'm not going to say! We didn't show everything – but Red Bull didn't show everything. Nobody showed everything. We will only see in Qualifying. So yeah, it's very difficult to know exactly how we are. But global picture just tells me we are maybe a bit behind. It's important, but as we've seen last year, it's not everything. And the development throughout the season is as important if not more. So yeah, I think we've had anyway very good testing in a way, that we did a lot of laps, we didn't have any reliability problems. And we did all the tests that we wanted to do in order to do all the scan that we wanted to do on the on the car, which is really, really important. So the tests were positive. Now to see exactly where we are compared to the others. We'll have to wait. Well, it's still very early days but I think what Fred is really, really good at is to extract the best out of the people by putting them in the best conditions. And this… we can already see some benefits so that's great. Then again, it was his first three days on track last week, so it's still very early days and we still need to see. I'm pretty sure he will discover much more things and see how the team works on a race weekend starting from tomorrow, so still early days, but at least it feels good. And it was impressive to see how well he got at ease with such a big team straightaway so that was important too. I relaxed. I relaxed. I came yesterday and before yesterday for like 45 minutes so to catch up with the engineers and try to speak a little bit about the weekend ahead, but mostly relaxing. I actually didn't do much. Just relaxing basically. No, I played padel. I played tennis. Padel is a pretty good one. I think. I mean, I think. I won. I know I won. Tennis? I would prefer not to speak about it. I broke my first racquet before yesterday because of the frustration. Tennis made me a bit anxious, but padel was good. Yeah, again, I think on half of a second, it's still too early to say and also during testing, depending on at what time of the day you are doing the lap time it is very difficult to judge so we'll wait and see to see how far off we are. But having said that, I also believe fully in my team and in the upgrades that we are bringing. We have a view of what we are bringing in the next few months, and it looks positive. So yeah. And by focusing on ourselves, I'm sure we will do a great job. Yeah, I think they will be in the mix. They will definitely fight at the top at least, I think I mean, yes, there's been a few changes but again, I wouldn’t want to comment too much on that. We are trying to do what's best for the team. Fred came and already saw a few things. It's again too early to judge too, because these things are affecting the race in itself so we'll see and time will tell whether these were the right choices. On our side, I think we did kind of a compromise and we took a direction by choice. Straight line speed was probably a weakness last year, I think we focused on that a bit more and we gained some of it, losing a bit of speed in the corners. But overall, I feel like we've done a good job and all the weaknesses that we had last year I improved so on that I'm confident that it's a better car. Than how much, we will see in qualifying on Saturday?",Bahrain,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, but it's not related to the car. I think it's important to always be relaxed. Yeah, it was good to spend a bit of time with family and friends and enjoy it a bit. Try not to think about Formula 1 too much. Yeah, spend a bit of time at home at some point as well. And get ready for racing again. We had three really good days. I think also just in general, the progress we made over the winter was very good. But we have to, of course, show it this weekend. But not only this weekend, of course, from there onwards, you continue to develop. And every track is also a bit different in terms of behaviour of the car. But yeah, the test days were good for us. Everywhere. That's the aim. I mean, you always strive to improve it. It feels nice. Well balanced, of course. Every team, of course, lost a bit of performance with the floor. But you always tried to gain that back, in a way. So you have to, of course, find a bit of a new balance of the car. But it's been good. Of course, the teams close to us. But also, I think, at the end of the day, from ourselves, because we have to stay on top of things and we cannot afford to make too many mistakes. I mean, we're not robots, everyone makes mistakes, but you tried to minimise it. Just seeing some friends at a few little meetings for things outside of Formula 1. I had a boat day, ate a lot of food. Yeah, it's been good. We had to stay around anyways, so I have a few friends living here, it’s always good to catch up. I forgot, I did some go karting too. Yeah, the go-kart track at the circuit… You need a racquet? Yeah, 100%. But our car was a bit fat last year so naturally, it's in a much better window and what you have learned throughout the whole year, last year, I think, gives you a much better understanding of the car. Sure, that naturally makes it better but that doesn't mean that we are satisfied. I think we're never satisfied, you always want to do better and we want to put improvements on the car, which we will do. Yeah, they looked very positive. In general, if you look at the team, they have a real desire, of course of getting to the front. They've hired I think quite a lot of good people. So it will be interesting to see where they will be but also not only now, it’s in the coming races and years, but I think they had a very positive start. Well, it gave me a chance to start in Formula 1 in the first place and it also gave me that next opportunity to jump into the main team. Probably without the second team I wouldn't have had that start in Formula I in 2015. So for me, it was very beneficial. Mainly that was the issue in the beginning of last year. I think throughout the year last year that improved already a lot. So this car, for sure, has a few different things on it but from the start, it felt much more to what I liked, of course so at the end of last year.",Bahrain,thursday,Red Bull
Pierre Gasly,"Les Bleus. Well, I must say I'm very proud, you know. Obviously, it's a special feeling to race for a French team and especially a French team which is based less than an hour away from my hometown. I know Alpine since I'm a little kid and there have been always particular links with Alpine and Renault and now it's the proper start of our journey together. Well, it's slightly different. AlphaTauri, as you know, is full of Italian people who have a bit more of the Italian culture. I will say Alpine is a mix between French and English and maybe slightly more international. But so far I've been really happy how the team welcomed me and the way we've been working, so I'm feeling pretty much home already. Everybody's really focused on the season that is coming and looking forward to seeing what we're going to be able to achieve. One thing I can say is that we're going to be faster than during the test. But where exactly, I don't even know myself. So I think, yeah, we're pretty confident, there were definitely positive signs of performance during the test and we haven't pushed with the softer compound but we know that the package is there. The season hasn't started yet so it was mainly about understanding which directions we want to take. But yeah, we'll be in the fight but I expect more answers or clear answers about the everyone's performance on Saturday. Yeah, minor. We want the score. Ah, you were very relaxed. Yeah, eating, suntanning and yeah, broke one padel racquet as well so I'm part of the club. Won one game, but… Lost a racquet. I got a spare. I know myself, so I got spares already. Yeah, I think it's been… Red Bull, the programme, I think we brought the most young drivers in the entire history of Formula 1, I think so. No, it's definitely an important place on the grid, gave the chance to Max, to Daniel, Carlos, myself, many of the guys that are on the grid today. So I think it's been working really well in that way. And Franz has been always there since day one, and always gave his very best to make it work for all of us. No, definitely very beneficial for the entire Red Bull team.",Bahrain,thursday,Alpine
