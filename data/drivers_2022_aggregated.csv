Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I mean, it's how it is. Sometimes everything can be really close. But at the end of the day, I’ve got to be happy. You know, I gave it all. We gave it all through the season. And I'm sure we will come back stronger for next year. Well, certainly, you know, we had great moments, great battling. I struggled a bit with these tyres this year, you know, in terms of managing the tyres in the race. So hopefully that can be something that we will improve for next year, and generally just be a bit stronger. Thank you, mate. Well, I think it's how this sport really works. You know, sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Today, I think Ferrari and Charles did a fantastic race. They have great tyre management. And they were stronger than us, especially on that first stint. I died towards the end. And that made it a little bit tricky, our strategy. And it was that second stint, while I was behind Max, Max was on a one-stop, I was on a two-stop, and then I ended-up not being able to, to maximise this stint, and I couldn't push as much as we should have pushed on that second stint. But at the end of the day, we gave it all. And that's what really matters. Yeah, we were discussing it at some points. But, yeah, I think we thought that the deg was going to be higher than it really is. And we just didn't push as much as we should have pushed on that second stint, and probably will left two seconds on the table there. Yeah, it's been… like Max said, how we started the first few races as a team, with the reliability issues that we had, to come away and have done such a strong job as a team, it's very encouraging. And I really hope that we can keep this momentum going for Red Bull, and come back next year even stronger. I believe that the competition will be a lot closer for next year. So, I really hope that we can keep this momentum going. Time to relax a bit, play some golf, get the handicap down. Yeah, that was always the plan for us. We, we knew we were going on to the two-stop. And by the way, we probably thought after the first stint that the deg was higher than it was really in the end, so we didn't push as much as we should on the two-stop, especially in the second stint. Well, I certainly lost a bit, probably a second or so or probably more. It was clearly blue flags, but he was in a fight and it's pretty hard not to give up the position. I think he was thinking to go for the move but I just end up being there and I thought he left it opens. I went for it and luckily I could brake at the last minute otherwise there would have been contact so I think in normal conditions that will certainly be a penalty for Pierre but it is the last race. I'm just happy to go home, don't discuss anything and it's how it goes sometimes. So nothing really more to add.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it did. I was 110% from the first lap to the last lap. Honestly, we had the perfect race for us, there was not much more today. I knew that the only possibility for us to beat Checo today was with a different strategy and playing with the tyre management, which we did really well today. And we managed to make the one-stop work. So really, really happy. Yeah, thank you. I mean, I really hope next year we can do a step forward in order to fight for the championship. But considering where we were last year, it's a really big step forward. I think we improved throughout the end of the season in terms of strategy. We still need to work in terms of race pace, because coming to Sunday we seem to struggle a bit more. But we'll push during the winter break in order to catch them back a little. It, it was really, really tricky. Especially at the end of the stint on the Hard, even though we did a really, really good management to be honest. It’s tricky, because when you get to the end of the race, the front-locking started to become a problem, so it was very easy to do a mistake. But at the end, we kept everything under control and managed to keep Checo behind. But I think today was a really, really perfect execution from our side. I don't think we had the pace of the Red Bulls still, and our goal from the beginning was to try and push Checo do something different, which we did perfectly. And again, with a great tyre management, we made the one-stop work, which eventually got us the second place. It was really difficult, especially on the Medium starts because obviously you do the first part of the race trying not to fight too much. But obviously in the first few laps Lewis was quite close after that. I don't know what happened, I think he had to give the position back to Carlos. And then at that point, I could manage my tyres a little bit better. It gave me a little bit of breathing space. And then from that moment onwards, then I think we did a great job. The plan was always to do a one-stop. But yeah, we managed to push them into doing two stops. It's difficult to sum it up. I mean, obviously, if I take a step back, considering from how far we come from last year, it's an amazing step forward. But obviously I cannot ignore our middle part of the season that has been super-frustrating. We went from leading the Championship with quite a bit of points to being behind by quite a bit of points. And that was a frustrating part of the of the season. So yeah, all in all, we just need to take all the mistakes that we've done this year and try to improve for next year. I think we really did some step forwards in terms of strategy and the way we have been taking decisions recently, in the last few races. Unfortunately, it was a bit more difficult to show it because the pace is not as good as the beginning of the season. But I'm confident that in terms of pace, we will manage to catch Red Bull back next year. Oh, pretty similar to Max. Try to do the least things possible. Obviously it's a long season and next year is going to be even longer. So yeah, I'll just relax with family and friends. Well, I think it was a combination of changing the setup from Friday to Saturday and putting a bit more importance on the race, and, and obviously the driving style also that I've changed quite a bit overnight from Friday to Saturday. And this paid off today. Yeah, I agree. I think we are all prepared for longer seasons. I hope it will be tight. It's always nice to have a fight until the until the end. But yeah, I'm prepared for more races and for a longer fight hopefully. I honestly, I mean, not I, but we, honestly don't believe that this has hurt us. We don't believe that it has hurt us. But, yeah, obviously, we've been looking into it quite a lot and we don't think it's coming from that. Well, honestly there are three key elements. It’s difficult to rank them but reliability has been a problem at one point of the season, which we paid the price for later on with penalties and other things. Strategy, I think we've done too many mistakes at one point of the season and tyre management. We haven't been consistent enough at our 100%. Today was a good race but we also sometimes have very bad races and we don't seem to have the understanding yet of how to have a good tyre management all the time. So these are the three key aspects in which we are focusing on at the moment. I felt like strategy has been definitely a step forward in the last few races, as I was saying before. Difficult to show because we don't have the pace that we had at the beginning of the year but the way we communicate, the way we take decisions is better. Of course, there was a few mistakes, but I think we took better decisions coming race day. Tyres, strategy and obviously reliability that we cannot forget are the three things that we'll be focusing on. Well, if anything, I could have pushed less on some occasions like in France, but no, I think in the first few years, there was always an area in particular where I was focusing on because I knew it was a weak point. I think now, it's been quite a few years that I'm in Formula 1 and it's more about getting the details and being at my 100% as often as possible. So, yeah, this is where I will try to focus on next year to try and be on my 100%. And then I'm confident that whenever I'm at my 100% I am really good.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a good race. It was all about tyre management. I think we looked after the Mediums quite well. And then on the Hard tyres it was literally managing from lap one to the end, but incredible, you know, to win again here and 15th win of the season is unbelievable. It's been really enjoyable, you know, to work with the whole team and to be able to achieve something like this this year. I know it's going to be hard to replicate something like this. But it's also very good motivation to try and do well again next year. It was a good race. I knew that if I would want to do a two-stop, it was a little bit compromised because I didn’t have two Hard tyres, so my target was always to try and make sure that the one-stop was going to work. On the Medium tyres initially, I think we had very good pace – just my last three laps on that tyre was a little more tricky but I had to get to a certain lap, right? And I think we managed to extend that stint quite well. And, yeah, once I put the hard tyres on, I brought them in quite nicely because I had a good gap. And at one point, I wanted to go a little bit faster, but we were still not sure if the tyre was going to hold on for the whole stint to the end. So, it was a bit of management to see if you could make it but then at one point, I hit, kind of a crossover where then the two-stop is not going to work anymore. But luckily, at that point, the tyres were really good and I could just continue to the end. Yeah, it was very nice. Ah, completely different weekend. I mean, Brazil, we had a lot of struggles. And I think we understood already quite a bit what went wrong there. But yeah, from the start, we were a lot more competitive here. It has been a great team effort, especially after our tough start to the year, to turn it around like that, I would have never imagined that, like nobody in the team. But it's been really enjoyable to be part of this team. We have a lot of fun. Of course, we focus on the performance but you also need to really enjoy the moment, appreciate the moment. And I think we definitely did that. We will do but we already also focusing on next year. You always say you try to do better. I know it's hard to do a lot better than this but you should always try to aim for that. Spa. Try not to do too much! Relax a bit, have holidays, spend time with family and friends. I do think it will be closer. People are understanding the cars a lot more. And, yeah, over time all the teams will just edge closer. But from our side, yeah, it's been a really positive weekend. So that's, of course, really encouraging also for next year. But we also know now, over the winter, we really have to keep pushing and keep trying to find performance and not only performance, understanding, possibly the tyres even more, because the tyres will change a bit for next year. So yeah, let's see how we are going to manage all of that. If you're not prepared, then it's better to stop already, right? I mean, I think we're all racers and we love racing. Of course it's just that it's nice to have a season like I had last year but it's also nice to have a season like I have this year. It just would be very tough if you have that every single year you know, the year I had last year but that also doesn't really happen in Formula 1 so it should be okay. No, there was not, but also that is quite a tricky call to make. You also don't want to end up… of course, you can possibly block but is that fair racing? I think not the nicest way going out of the season, like that. And it looked like Checo was catching him enough to try and actually get a move but then he lost quite a bit of time with that bit of a fuss between… was it Pierre and Alex probably? You lost quite a bit of time with that, because I was watching the screen. But yeah, unfortunate. I think, like Checo said, that second stint, because the deg was quite high on the Medium, in hindsight, probably, as a team, we could have pushed a bit more on that on that middle stint for Checo, but that's always easy to say afterwards. At the time, we thought that we had to be a little bit careful on the tyres. Again, we've had a lot of great weekends, but even in great weekends, there are always things that you can learn. Yeah, let's wait and see. We've tested a few different things so let's see what they will bring here and then get our conclusions on it. And yeah, it's important to get the first read and make sure that we already have a basic understanding before we go into next season. But again, every track is different, so yeah, it's of course always nice to run these tyres but throughout the season, you will always learn a lot about them.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Red Bull
Sebastian Vettel,"Well, you know how it is. I wish it would have been up a couple more points. But yeah, I enjoyed the race. I think it was a bit of a different warm-up today to get into the race but once the lights go off, it's full-on race mode. I think, about today, we obviously didn't go for maybe the best strategy, so it was a shame, because I think we could have turned the Constructors’ Championship around for us. But yeah, overall obviously a big day and a big thank you for all the support. So many flags, so many smiling faces, which has been very, very special, very nice and yeah, I'm sure I'm going to miss it more than I understand right now. Obviously we then opted to stay out and you know, once the tyres were getting older, we were going backwards, but once we committed to the one-stop, I think that was it. But it was obviously the slower strategy today. So, not so enjoyable when you are in the car and you are going backwards. I was fighting through the people and had a nice battle with Daniel, but just couldn't get close enough. But yeah, I think it's nice also with him to fight the last couple of laps. And, you know, both of us finishing the points. So yeah, it's been a big weekend. Well, I don’t have that much more to say. I feel a bit empty, to be honest, it's been a big weekend. But I can only repeat, you know: I think the last two years have been very, maybe disappointing from a sporting point of view, but very, very useful and important to me in my life, a lot of things happened. A lot of things that I realised. I think it's a huge privilege being in the position that we are in and with that comes some responsibility. So I hope to pass on a little bit to the other drivers to carry on some of the good work. It's great to see that, you know, we have the power to inspire you with what we do and what we say. So I think there are far bigger and far more important things than racing in circles, but obviously it's what we love and through that if we can transfer some of the really important values that's big. And I think for that the last two years have been have been great for me. So thank you for the support. Thank you for the messages, the letters and all the love in general. So yeah, I will miss that. But it's been an absolute joy throughout my career, so thank you. Thank you.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a bit of an up and down qualifying, you know. It started off quite well. Q2 was a little bit more messy. I honestly don't know why. With that tyres set I just couldn't get the grip together. But then in Q3 it all felt a bit more normal. And yeah, we had a bit of a scare, the car turned off before the first run. So we had to reboot everything. And then we went out and both of the laps were good enough, so of course very pleased with that. But also very happy that both cars are on the front row because we know that of course we want to win the race but we also want to finish second with Checo in the championship. So that's definitely a great start for tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, it always sounds great. For sure today was amazing. I still expect it to be a good battle tomorrow, but at least we have both cars there and we can we can do what we want. Yeah, Q3 was good. Before that, it was all a bit up and down. But Q3, first run, I mean, even there, it started a bit chaotic, where I was supposed to, of course, drive out in front of Checo. But as soon as I wanted to start my engine, everything just turned off. So, we had to reboot the car. And then yeah, luckily, I still managed to get out, a bit delayed, which is also not great with the tyres. But we still managed to keep everything under control and did a good lap. So, I was happy with that. And the second one was a little bit more straightforward but it wasn't it wasn't easy to find a lot more lap time. It's just a little bit in the last sector. But I think overall this weekend for us as a team, also, we’ve been on it, the car has been quick again basically a little bit more like back to normal. We knew that we had a quick car, I think we just made a few mistakes in Brazil, in hindsight. I can't go into too much detail about it but the thing is, with the Sprint race, when you have one practice and you don't nail it there, you are stuck with it for the rest of the weekend. And that's basically what we had. And then you know it's going to be a bit of a struggle. But again, maybe we can do something better in terms of our preparation before going there. So that's again, a lesson learned. But once we got here, I think the work at the simulator paid off and immediately, I could see were in FP1, you know, Checo feeling quite happy, also Liam in the car, he seemed straightaway on it. So it means that the car is in a good window. And then when I jumped in and FP2, it was just about fine tuning a few things. No, not at all. Because as soon as I jumped in, in FP2 It was good. So, it didn't really feel like lost track time to me. It was just very up-and-down. Like the first Q1 was good but then in Q2, I put a new tyre set on and it was massively, like, rear-limited. And even when I went out again on that set, and then I just put a new tyre set on in Q3 and everything was solved again, So it’s a bit of a mystery. To try to win it you mean? Just looking after the tyres. That's going to be key. No, well, so going into the weekend, we gave Checo the option to choose what he would like:  do you want to go first or behind? He chose to go behind and that was also the plan in qualifying but like I said, I was planned to go ahead in the first run as well but my engine… yeah, everything just turned off. But luckily, we got it together for the second one. It's difficult to tell at the moment. I think, from our side, we looked good in FP2 with the long run and it seemed like both Ferrari and Mercedes seemed to struggle a little bit more at the time. But I don't know what they have done overnight so I guess we'll find out tomorrow. I think as a team, we just need to stay ahead of them, that's very clear, because that means that also Checo is ahead in the championship. Maybe the layout, but honestly it is a bit of a mystery but even for us we didn't expect to be so slow in Brazil so clearly we don't always seem to understand where we are really good or just pretty average. But a  little surprised, but I mean, who knows, maybe they focus more on the long run and sacrifice a little bit of one lap performance. You never know. Well, I think in general on average, this year, it has been a bit better to follow of course.  The only penalty with that is of course the drag is a little bit less so sometimes it seems you need a little bit of a longer DRS to try and then get by. I do think with the new layout turn  five is an improvement to attack into six. Turn nine, I think is a little bit too quick. You only can really fight if you are like side by side but even then the car on the inside with the banking, it’s tough. I like the quick corner because that's more fun and in a Formula 1 car but I think actually to have a proper braking zone and possibly like just a hairpin, I think that would have been better for racing, but at least turn five I think is an improvement.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it’s a good starting [place]. I think we didn't make that that final step in Q3. Especially Q3 run one wasn't that good? So we were a bit behind but it's good, you know. It's good to lock out that front row for tomorrow. Max did a great job also for me, you know, we worked together as a team really strongly on that final run. So yeah, looking forward to tomorrow, which is the day that really matters. Yeah, thank you very much all the fans that are here and I really hope that tomorrow we can have a strong race. I think it’s going to be a very interesting one, you know, given how strong Ferrari will be, Mercedes, you know. With Max it will be an interesting one tomorrow. Yeah, it was a good session. It was looking better after Q2, then Q3, it didn't start that well, especially run one, wasn’t ideal.  Then the second run was quite a lot better. Not enough for pole, though. So still, I think being on the front row for the team it's a good result, especially after the weekend we come from, you know, in São Paulo where we struggled quite a bit. It's nice to be back. Yeah, it certainly did. I think we worked really well as a team today. And I could feel, especially Sector 2, it was working. What you gain, you lose a bit in Sector 3, but generally, I think certainly it was a positive thing. Yeah, it's going be a difficult race. I do expect them to be strong. So, it's going to be a close battle with Charles, so it will be an interesting one for tomorrow. It’s quite exciting. It’s great to be playing for something in the final race. So it is good. We were certainly trying different stuff yesterday, certainly in FP1. Track conditions were fairly different so going into FP2, we decided to split cars and try different stuff and we ended up coming back to a different level to Max. Yeah, nothing really to add. I think we will see a bit more than last year but fairly similar to what we've seen this year. So I think probably the degradation seems to be a bit higher, which can be a bit more interesting in the race tomorrow. So we’ll see.  I don't think anyone has done a proper long run so it will be an interesting race tomorrow.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"I locked up in Turn 6/7, but to be honest, it is the place we deserve. Today the Red Bulls were stronger. But we are still in quite a good position for tomorrow. But it’s going to be close with Checo for sure. Well, I mean, I'm sure we can work together to with Carlos, I have no doubt on that. And we'll try to maximise the team result. We know Red Bull is a bit stronger on the Sunday so it’s going to be tricky, but we are going to give it all and hopefully we can get that second place in the Drivers’ and Constructors’ Championships. I mean, first, before going on holiday we need to focus on tomorrow. Obviously after the last two very difficult years for the team its’ good to have done a step forward. And it would be great for the team to get that second place in the Constructors’ especially, so I'll push for that and then we'll go into holidays, rest and hopefully come back stronger next year. Yeah, well, let's see. It's difficult to know for now. We've had a difficult FP2. During the race simulations, it felt definitely quite a bit better this morning. But we had no reference, so it's a bit of a question mark for now. I felt like we are in a better place compared to yesterday. Whether this is enough to beat the Red Bulls tomorrow I don't know yet. But we'll give it all. We put quite a lot of attention this weekend on it. So I hope not. No, as Mark said, it was really, really tricky to put the tyres in the right window, and you will get a very different feeling from one lap to another. And it was also quite a lot about management, even in Qualifying. If you were pushing First and Second Sector, then you will lose it all in Sector 3. So I tried to find that balance that I think I found in the last lap of Q3. But it wasn't enough to challenge Checo. We were also a little bit alone. I had no slipstream, so I don't know how much this… we paid the price. But yeah, overall, looking forward to tomorrow. Yeah, well, difficult to say for the strategy. I think we'll have to see once we are in the race, and what are the opportunities at that moment. Obviously, Carlos is starting right behind me and hopefully we can put a bit of pressure on Checo by doing different things. I mean, regardless of the championship, if there's an opportunity, I'll try and go for it. So yeah, I'll go for it if there's an opportunity.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sebastian Vettel,"I don't know. Maybe I should ask Fernando, he went through it already! He will go through it again, I guess, at some point. But yeah, I feel okay. I mean, obviously, I guess after so many years and races, there's the routine of Thursday. But I think it's difficult in a way to grasp but I'm aware of what's happening and I'm happy about it, as far  as I can be. I will see. I guess at some point it will be a little bit different. It does feel a little bit different already today, even though, like I said, a lot of it is routine. But yeah, how much and how it will be I don't know yet. I guess you have to ask me again. If you catch me. I don't think it works that way. I don't think it's fair to pick one. So, I obviously can't speak for an hour now, and I don't really want to but I think I've been lucky that there's been so many moments to choose from. Yeah, impossible to remember everything after so many years. I guess the firsts, in a way, always stand out. But yeah, I think every time had its highlights. There were its moment, and I also enjoy the last two years, even though from a sporting point of view, maybe they weren't really a highlight. There was nothing to celebrate, no success in this regard. Still, I think, I learned a lot. I think I progressed, I grew and had a good time together with a team. We didn't get the reward on track but still, I don't think it's fair to pick only one race or one moment. I’m actually quite sorry… it’s your answer but I think Baku wasn’t a great moment, because what I did wasn’t right. But actually from that moment onwards… Yeah, a lot better. So I don’t want that moment to… not happen, if you see what I mean! Maybe we can make a deal. We’ll speak outside, when you want to get away, maybe I want to come back! Well, I think, looking back, obviously 2020 wasn't a good year for me. And then it was the first time when I was really at the point of, you know, do I have a drive? Do I want to drive? Should I stop? And I felt like I wanted to drive and I was very grateful for the opportunity that I was given, obviously, hopes were high, because the team was performing so well in 2020. And the target was to keep doing that. It came differently but I think those years have been very important for me: one for the driving, but also, maybe to have the  room and the possibility to grow even more off-track. And some of the things that I've addressed that I feel are very, very important to all of us, having had the freedom and space to do so. But also from a sporting point of view. Fernando touched on it, we were racing each other quite a lot in the last two years. I don't think I've had a lot of races where I started inside the top 10 And it's a different race, it's a lot more busy, it's more hectic, a lot more things happen. It's very clean when you start from the top five positions and you don't need to worry about it. Whereas if you start further back, anything is always possible. And also, it was showing me the effort that a team in the midfield, that you don't even know, in a way, it exists when you're always at the front, puts in a lot of effort and maybe even more effort, and doesn't get any reward. Teams but also drivers, I think the commitment is as high as it is at the front but you guys all care for the front which is the name of the game and the sport and that's how it is and how it should be. So yeah, I think lots of different aspects that taught me different lessons about our sport, my racing, but also about life. I don't know,  how old am I going to be? How old are you now? 40? 41? So I have a bit of time. Yeah, I think naturally you do look at other stuff. I don't know yet, is the answer. So, I think I quite look forward to the idea of nothing, at first, and then see what it does to me. I mean, there are lots of other things in my head as well. Other interests and ideas outside racing. But yeah, obviously I've done this for so long and it's a big part of… It's central to my life. So it will be difficult to say that I'm not going to miss it, but how much and whether then I start to look at something else, we'll see. I always liked, for some reason, rallying, but I can see it’s a major challenge, because it's so different to what we do in, let's say, classic circuit racing. So yeah, I don't know. We'll see. Big question. I don't know, I think in general, more transparency, because I think the world is opening up, F1 should follow, should lead, so more transparency. More credibility, as I think with all the claims and all the things that we're saying we're doing and wanting to do in the future, I think we need to prove that we are actually doing them, as a sport, and then from a car point of view, I would make the cars a lot lighter. I think it brings a lot of joy. By definition, if the cars are lighter we'll have less problems with tyres. It will be more physical, more exhausting, I think it would be more exciting for driving the cars. Well, I don't know yet, but I definitely thought about a lot of things and about the adrenaline as well. And to me, the peak of the adrenaline was/is always Suzuka, because the track really shows the most the cars can deliver and made me feel most alive compared to, let's say, maybe other tracks. So yeah, I will miss that and that will be impossible to replace. I can do lots of other things and I have lots of opportunities, probably. I think I'm in a very privileged and lucky position. But when it comes to adrenaline, the sort of feeling alive inside the car, when you feel the forces and the grip and everything around the track, yeah that will disappear, but I feel at some point it's going to hit all of us – except Fernando! So yeah, I think it's something we'll ultimately have to learn to deal with and find something else to maybe replace that in a little way. So yeah, we’ll see. Well, it will be more than a day now. I hope it will be much longer than a day. So I don't worry about the one day so much. But yeah, like I said, you know, I said nothing earlier. Obviously, I have plenty of ideas. But I think it's that not having a commitment, not having the race calendar that kicks off by definition in February, not having that January getting ready, visiting the team, getting ready for the new season, seeing the new car. I think a lot of things, you know, that have given me so much to hold on to in the last years, looking forward for them to disappear. Not that I hate them. I don't hate racing, I love racing. There's been many moments this year where I loved what I was doing so much. But I think I see it as a challenge. I see it as an opportunity to learn a lot about myself and to put myself in exactly that position that I haven't been before and I'm not comfortable with, because I think the truth is, after so many years, we know how to do this job, I don't want to say asleep, because that's arrogant, but I would say with a lot of routine and a lot of experience. A lot of things don't surprise you anymore. So I’m looking forward to being surprised and as I said, learn about myself, spend more time with my kids and family, learn together with them, which obviously will be a different challenge to me and a different pace. But yeah, lots of things, and give more room to maybe the things that I naturally didn't have time for. Because I was doing this. So, yeah, we'll see. It's not like I have a calendar and will say in March, this is going to happen, and in April or May this is going to happen. I think I look forward to not having the calendar and then obviously at some point I need to find a lot of things that will keep me busy because I'm a busy, busy bee, busy mind. So yeah.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Aston Martin
Lewis Hamilton,"When I think of Seb… he was a bit of a nuisance back then! …Our friendship got better! I agree. We always had such great battles, honestly, and I was just thinking, most drivers are coming back. He’s come back [Alonso], you’re probably going to come back. We’re seeing other drivers coming back, so I’m sitting here accepting, yes,  it’s your last race… but… He’ll be back. Formula 1 has a way of sucking you back in. We’ve noticed that from so many other drivers. No? And just swap. Alternate. Who knows? We are still improving the car. We don't believe that this track will necessarily be our strongest. We think it’s suited to the others a little bit better, but I won't know ‘til I get out there, to be honest. I hope that it's like the last race. Yeah. I was just thinking of the first race we had here in 2009, which I think Seb… actually it was one of the races we were competing in again, which Seb won.  But, yeah, it's been an amazing journey, one that I'm incredibly honoured to have been on with Mercedes. And it's, I think, it's one of the longest standing drivers with a team? So, proud of that. Shows loyalty continues to be at the core of one of the many pillars of the values that we have as a team and looking forward to extending. I don’t really think about it, so I don't really have many thoughts on the last race here. I've had many great experiences here in the previous years. Even from the first race that I had here in 2009, which was the hybrid era in which I was leading and had the brake failure, which was… I remember the feeling of having to retire in that race. So I've had lots of ups and downs at this race. And, yeah, just I'm not really necessarily focused on stuff that it's behind me, and more so trying to… not control but trying to be the best I can move forwards and the days ahead. And again, just as I said, just really proud. It's crazy that I’ve been with Mercedes. They started with me when I was 13 in 1997, so it's been a long journey with them. I don't look in the past and try and think of what I could have done better necessarily, in that respect, no. Honestly, I haven't checked. So, I think I was quite lucky that there wasn't really a huge amount of damage. I don't really know how there wasn't damage, obviously, because it was a decent knock. I think I lost one of the wheel-shield things, which I think lost a little bit performance. But obviously with the next tyre change that came back. The team have not told me that there was anything particular, so I don't think I was down. Shoot, I don't really remember. I just thought it was a really funny picture. I mean, just sitting here, we've got the three oldest drivers here. And then you are the youngest here. How old are you? Are you really 22? It's good to have a good fake ID. But no, it was just a funny picture just to think of how time travels and yeah, jeez, we've been here for a long time. I don't think so. I think at the beginning maybe but yeah, I think my love for the sport is still the same. And I think my commitment and time here hopefully is showing that. I think it's just been a much, much different year, one that naturally none of us in the team expected. And it's taught us lessons that we, again, hadn't realised that we didn't have or hadn't experienced in the past. And I think it's just made us stronger. I think it's been a really positive year in that respect. What keeps me going? I don’t know. It’s a question I have myself probably. Maybe it's that Fernando and Seb are still here. But now obviously we're going to be losing Seb. I don't know. I think I still love what I'm doing. I still love the challenge every year trying to evaluate at the end where you've been, what you've learned, leave the crap behind and then you know take the good bits forward. How can you evolve to be better each time? How can you be healthier? How can you expand your mind and your body and spirit, so that I'm fully focused on doing that all the time. And yeah, we're talking about the adrenaline rush. I mean, naturally, we're all adrenaline seekers, and I don't think that's… I'm sure Seb’s going to have to find something else because I think driving the farm truck is not going to bring that! Your tractor, you said you had a tractor. Maybe he’ll come skydiving with me. I tried to talk him into it, but he said he's got kids, so it's probably not going to happen…",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Mercedes
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, I mean, it's going to be strange to don't have him in next year and the first race. But yeah, I mean, we share, as you said, so many things. Over the last 15 years, sometimes we fought for championships, sometimes for seven places, even in Japan to the finish line, and we still obviously always enjoy every single battle and, and respect each other as much as we could. So yeah, I think my career is going to be linked to Sebastian in a way because we fought for many great things and in the best seasons of our life, probably, and even though it was on his side, the outcome always. I think it's going be very linked, our two names – or my name in Sebastian’s career, and vice versa. No, not yet. I will ask on Sunday evening. Let's see. I think it has been up and down a little bit for us in terms of performance, but also reliability has been our weakest point. So, let's see if we can finish the season on a high and with a good result here. About how competitive we can be, I don't think that we can repeat the Brazil performance. I don't think that we will be that close to the top three but hopefully if we are in front of the midfield that's already something for us, so that's the target ,finishing the race with a good result and yeah enjoy every single lap on Sunday. Great obviously, coming back to the sport is never a guarantee that you will be okay and competitive and you still enjoy everything in Formula 1. So I had some concerns, obviously, two years ago, when I did the demo here, before the Young Driver test in 2020 and yeah, I think last year it was not maybe 100% happy with the performance and with how the season went. This year, I'm much more happy with the car and with the performance itself and much more I think ready for the next challenge. So, you cannot underestimate coming back to the sport – in case Seb wants some advice – but you need a few races or even one full season to feel 100 per cent again and is what happened to me but I'm happy now that I'm I feel a very good level. Sure. I don't know what his emotions are now but in 2018, for me, even the front wing, I don’t know if you noticed, it was written ‘see you later’. It was not a bye-bye. So in a way, in my head, it was always the 2021 rules, an opportunity to come back. I had in my head different challenges at that point. I wanted to race in Daytona, in Dakar, in Le Mans.  I wanted to fight for a World Endurance Championship. I don't know, I had different things, and Formula 1 was not a priority, or I didn't have my head in Formula 1 anymore. But I love Formula 1 And I felt that in 2021 It could be an opportunity with the new rules and maybe everything re-shuffles a little bit, in terms of how the teams are, or the competitiveness of them. So yeah, I mean, I fulfill all my boxes in those years away from Formula 1, and I still watch the races at home. And yeah, the rules. They postponed the rules one year for 2022. But I came in 2021 anyway.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Alpine
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, this year, consistently, we're having up and down season so far, so could be good. Like last year. But yeah, see how it goes. In Brazil, wasn't as good as what I wanted. So obviously, I wish, hopefully, I can continue like the result I had last year which was best results for me. So having good memories, so it's already good start. So, see how it goes. For me, I think I would say in general: physical side; mentality side and driving side. I think overall, I'm pretty happy, especially I'll say, now I’m feeling relaxed in the race week, especially Thursday, Friday, which I didn't know how to approach and I was stressing consistently, especially last year, rushing everything. That makes a little bit to stress and can be frustrating, and made it a little bit difficult by myself. But now I can kind of be relaxing and I know how to adapt to any situation. So, feeling confidence, good confidence and anything that happens, like the things I didn't expect, still, I know how to handle it. So yeah, I think overall, this year, I'm pretty happy about the how I progressed, every race. And yeah, I think hopefully I can continue or even more, this momentum. And also next year as well. No, currently, I'm planning for a little bit more in Europe. And I'll go back to Japan, but I think it'll be as short as it was probably last year and then come back to Europe and train as last year or this year’s beginning of the season. So I'm not planning on spending too long there. Or else I am going to be really fat. 22. I don't know. Sometimes I also have questions about it as well.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,AlphaTauri
Nicholas Latifi,"Yeah, there’s obviously a range of different emotions. I mean, for sure, when I found out the news I wasn't going to be continuing with the team, there was six races to go, so I went in with the approach to enjoy each opportunity, try to make the most of it, and try to enjoy as much as I can and not sweat or stress about the little stuff. Or what seems like the little stuff in hindsight, that’s been difficult to deal with throughout the season. And obviously now, we’ve arrived at the last race which, on the one hand felt like it was very slowly approaching but on the other hand, quite quickly, so a bit of a weird position. Coming into the race, for sure it's a bit sad, and then disappointing. I mean, I would love to continue on in Formula 1. I mean, that's my goal. That's where I want to be. But it's looking obviously, like, it's not going to be the case. So, you know, I'm grateful for the opportunity that I've had these three years, I know the very privileged position I've been in. Many drivers would kill to drive one race, let alone, three years in F1, so I'm very grateful for that and just looking to enjoy it as much as I can. I think it’s safe to say it’s been a very up-and-down year. My first two years were… I guess what you can expect, as the first two years in Formula 1: a rookie season is a rookie season. Second year, I think there was some really big improvements all across, all around, and I guess this year, as a team, collectively we took a step backwards and I just struggled to get on top of the car. Various different issues. Obviously some things in my control, come things out of my control. That’s motor sport, that’s the way it always goes. This year I would say ultimately was my worst year out of the three years in what was a crucial year for me to secure the future. So, I think that’s the reality of it. And it just didn’t work out in the end. Not yet. That's a tough one. I mean, I guess someone in the position I've been in the past years, let's say, probably less differences between the cars. But I mean, that's obviously part of Formula 1 and having that, let's say, scope for technical creativity and whatnot. I mean, it's obviously the direction the sport is trying to go in, to kind of close the field together. But yeah, obviously being in the position where we, as a team, have been fighting for the positions towards the back, and for sure, I would have loved to experience being able to be in more of a fight. And I think that goes without saying for podiums and wins, but you know, even just points more often. That's probably what I would say.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Williams
George Russell,"No, he wasn't to be honest! No, I think there were quite a lot of us on that flight. There was Carlos, myself, Charles, Pierre, Kevin, Fernando, Esteban, Lewis… You've all missed out! I think because there were so many emotions on Sunday night, and, you know, speaking with all of you guys afterwards, and then the celebrations with the team, everyone was in a bit of a rush to get to the airport. The flight didn't take off until 3am and I was just absolutely knackered. So celebrations… Not all of it not. I slept quite a long time. It was a tough race! No, celebrations have been put on hold until this Sunday. I've got some of my family out here this weekend. So yeah, Sunday night this week. Not too sure, to be honest, I think, you know, obviously, just very proud of the achievement. It’s something I've worked my whole life towards and what you dream of as a child. And you know, my years in Formula 1 , you dream of that moment. You go into every race sort of believing you can achieve it, but sometimes recognising very early on in a weekend that it's not going to be probably possible that weekend. But the stars just seemed to align that weekend. And the race on Sunday was perfect. And coming away with maximum points, yeah, it was pretty special. No, I don't think so. To be honest, I always believed I could achieve victories and you believe you can become a world champion. For sure confidence is high and the morale within the team is booming. But you know, I don't suddenly feel transformed overnight. I still feel the same driver as I was this time one week ago. Yeah, I think we’ll be going for it. To be honest, I think since Austin the car's been performing really well and probably better than we could have ever hoped for. For sure, Max and Red Bull are going to be fast here. I think the combination of the low-speed corners and the long straights, they are going to suit their car really, really well. But, you know, we saw even in Brazil, on a circuit that we didn't expect to be quite as competitive, we were still very quick. So yeah, we'll be going for it. Yeah, a lot of do's in there.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Mercedes
Daniel Ricciardo,"I had to go on the simulator! I notice George’s head is a little bigger. I think, as George kind of touched on, it's something you truly believe you can do and obviously achieve, but until you do, you just don't know. Was that a tongue twister? A lot of do’s. No don’ts. But it's, yeah, we've won in junior categories. So it's like, we know how to win, but doing it at that level and, let's say, on the main stage… Until you cross that line and get that feeling and like, confirm it all to yourself, you just don't know. I looked at George, obviously on the weekend, and it reminded me of those emotions from the first win and I could obviously relate to what he's gone through and you can't not be happy for someone, you know, it's one of the best days of your life. It's a game changer. So pretty special. I feel good. I'm not, let's say… Mentally, I'm not treating it like it's going to be my last ever race. But it could be, like, I know that nothing's guaranteed in the future. So I'm just kind of going out to enjoy it. I'm not going to get too emotional about the thought of ‘oh is it the last one or not’. But I do want to enjoy it and just take it for what it is. I’ve got a grid penalty. I normally go better when I have penalties. I actually asked for a five place penalty, but three will do so, yeah, there we go. Not yet. I mean, I say progress, yes. But still nothing's confirmed. But progress is being made. So we'll see. Yeah, hopefully, you can see my good looks again next year, to some degree. When you said former, I thought you were saying Max is hanging it up! You’re not are you? One more season! With Seb, I feel like I've been asked a lot, I'm sure we all have since he announced his retirement and only good things to say, let's start with that. I think as a person I can speak so highly of him. Also, just on a personal level, some things he's done for me, yeah, just very, very appreciative of. I think he's a very caring individual. He cares about the sport as a whole, but he also cares about, let's say, us drivers. We're all competitors, for sure, but I think he's definitely able to separate that. And yeah, just look out for us, ultimately. And, yeah, as a competitor, I think back to 2013, when he won every race in the second half of the season. And it was like a relentless approach, like he just wasn't satisfied. He just wanted to ultimately destroy the competition. And you could just see, like, the raw competitor in him and that drive to not win, but to destroy if you will, and you had to admire and respect that.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"You slept the whole flight? Charles said you slept the whole flight! Not yet. Well, first of all, of course, he has meant a lot to Red Bull. He came through as a junior and basically achieved all of it in the sport, you know. I mean, he still has a lot of friends within Red Bull, of course all the way up. He's had a career which a lot of people could only dream of. But at the end of the day, that's not everything. I think, as a person, he's always been very caring. Of course, I had my heated battles with him, especially in the beginning of my career. But for me, one thing I will always remember for the rest of my life, last year, in Silverstone, I came back from the hospital to get to my motorhome to get all my stuff and he was there, waiting for me when I got out of the car. And he said, ‘are you OK, Max, how are you doing? Are you okay?’ And that just shows how he is, you know, a super nice, caring person who is not only there for performance, but also means well, you know. I think that's also really nice to be remembered like that. And yeah, we'll also do a helmet swap this weekend, so that's definitely a very nice helmet to have in the collection. He will definitely be missed. But on the other hand, I also really wish him well for the future, whatever he wants to do, to be honest, but I think what is most important is to spend time with family. You know, he's a real family, man. And that's great to see and a great example. Yeah, it was not particularly a great weekend for us in in Sao Paulo, but yeah, we do understand a few things; still a few things we need to analyse a bit more, but we have enough time to do so before we get there again next year. But yeah, of course you always try to do well every single weekend. Some races are just a bit better than others, some tracks suit your car a little bit better than others and I think also around there the tarmac is very aggressive and we'd only one practice session, probably we didn't get the setup right as well and then when you can't change it, you have to carry it for the rest of the weekend. So we know that and that definitely didn't help the performance. Yeah, I'm looking forward to see the battle. And yeah, as a team, you know, we've never finished first and second so if we could achieve that, that would be amazing and for sure, if the opportunity is there to help, as a team we're going to do that. It wasn't about the position. It doesn't matter if (it was) first or second or sixth or seventh or 10th. It was about something that happened earlier in the season and I already explained that in Mexico and the team understood and agreed. And yeah, we went to Brazil and I just thought we’re just going to race, tried to get the best possible result and yeah, we had a bit of a miscommunication. On Saturday and Sunday nothing had been said to me about a potential swap or whatever. It only came into that last lap that it was said on the radio and I think they should have known my response already from what I said the week before and after that race, yeah, we had some good discussion and we put everything on the table and everything has been solved. So in hindsight, we should have had that conversation earlier because I have never been a bad teammate to anyone, I've always been very helpful and the team knows that. I always put the team upfront because at the end of the day, it is a team effort. I think what we learned from that is that we have to be a little bit more open and we just have to communicate better to each other. But after that race, of course, yeah, I looked very bad, you know, in the media, but also they didn't have the clear picture, but to immediately put me down like that… it's pretty ridiculous to be honest, because they don't know how I work within the team and what the team appreciates about me. So all the things that I've read is pretty disgusting. And also, even more than that, they started attacking my family. They were threatening my sister and my Mum, my girlfriend, my Dad and for me that goes way too far. Well, you don't even have the facts, of what actually was going on and that definitely has to stop. If you have a problem with me, that's fine, but don't go after my family because that is just unacceptable. But we move on. Honestly, I have a great relationship with Checo but I just don't understand when people don't have the full picture to really start attacking me like that. I hope one day they actually understand what was going on because it's just unacceptable behaviour of so many people. Also in this paddock, to be honest, it's not only fans, but a lot of people, what they have been writing about me, it's just ridiculous. I'm not going to go into detail what that was, because that will stay between myself and the team but it is just incredibly disappointing that while you're not knowing the full facts, that people write so many bad things straight away. I don't know why that is but at the end of the day, you contribute to all the problems social media has by writing these kind of things. So yeah, like I said before, it's just incredibly disappointing as well to read these kinds of things, because I know how I am, the team knows how I work with them and I've always been good to the team. I don't think so. Well, when your own sister writes you that it's getting way too much and you have to do something about it, I think that says enough. So, yes, it does get to me because you cannot attack my family. As I said before I'm not going into details, when or how it happened. And I already said before that we had to communicate better. So sorry about that. We keep it between the team and myself. But I mean you don't know the real story so you don't need to write the story. But I'm just a bit fed up with all this bullshit, just going around all the time. As soon as something negative that needs to be highlighted, and it's pretty sickening, to be honest, being part of all that. While at the end of the day, I haven't even done anything wrong. It's just people misunderstood what was actually going on. It's not only related to that, to be honest, but I won't be here when I'm 40, that's for sure.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Again, I can only agree with whatever has been said by Max and Daniel. He has been incredible. He's achieved so much in the sport. And there is nothing much more to say on that side, but as a person, he's been incredible. I remember, already in Formula 2, I was doing the simulator work, which, okay, it's not an easy work to do, because it's really, really tiring and I thought that Seb probably didn't even know I was on the simulator. And I received a letter one day, just thanking me for all the hard work. And that meant a lot for me at that time. But that was only a small thing. Then obviously we became teammates in 2019 and 2020 also, where he has taught me really a lot. We've had our tense moments on track, but the respect off the track has never changed and he's always been there for me whenever I had difficult times. And that was very different to what I was used to with my previous teammates. Obviously, in Formula 1 it’s normal, there's inner competition inside the tea but he has always been super caring and trying to help me whenever I was going through more difficult times. But yeah, he will definitely be missed. I'm sure that he will enjoy his time off the racetrack, and that he will find other things that that makes him happy. I mean, overall, there are always rumours around Formula 1, and especially around Ferrari and this doesn't change. Obviously, when we are getting to the end of the season, there are always voices around us. But I think as a team, we really need to focus on our job and on track, try to extract all of the things that are happening around the team. People tend to forget how big of a step we've done from last year to this year. There's definitely another step that we need to do but I am sure that we'll do it all together, and starting with this race, hopefully to finish on a high this season. But apart from that, there's nothing more to say. I don't think we should give too much attention to that. Well, I hope so. It's been a bit up and down in the last few races. Brazil has been good but unfortunately because of our first lap incident, it was all about coming back to the front, but the pace was there so I hope we’ll be strong enough to fight for the top positions. Obviously, we are fighting for the second place in the Drivers Championship and also the second place in the Constructors Championship. And again, after going through very two very tough years in 2020 and 2021, it will be good to be back fighting at the top, even though our goal is to fight for the championship in which eventually after these difficult years it will be good to be second. I think stability is paying off. We've been showing in the last few years that we are improving. As I was saying earlier then there's another step that we need to do but we are working on that and I'm sure we'll achieve that. Well, obviously, it's a big statement, what was made by the media but again, they remain rumours, but also for the team in itself it's not great to read these things. So I think it's good that the team has cleared the air, and hopefully we can focus 100% on that last weekend, that again, is an important one.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Ferrari
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, obviously it's disappointing in some ways, because I feel like I've been doing a good job up to this point. On the other hand, the team decided to go that way so I have to respect that. And so yeah, I'm focused on the future now. We've had our ups and downs for sure but I think that the trend was always pointing upwards and I think that that's what's important, and it's only my second year in Formula 1. Last year, I don't even know if you can really count it as a year, because obviously it was a tough one. We were only at the back. And so yeah, it was definitely something I had to get used to, being in the midfield pack fighting and I feel that across the year we've managed to do that and I feel like I've extracted the maximum out of each situation, I'd say. So yeah, I feel that the trend was there. Well, I definitely want to stick around and I have time now so I will see all the options that I have. And, and then yeah, hopefully take the right one that will bring me into a bright future. Finish as high as we can, I guess. We have a car which is probably just close to P10, maybe a bit below but if we get everything right I'm sure there's potential to be in the points and I think that that's still what we're aiming for, to score as many points because we're going to tight battle with Alpha Tauri and also for me, in the driver's standing, I want to be obviously as far forwards as I can Yeah, PTW, it's been pretty much what I've been saying most part of this year. And yeah, I just felt like saying that because I think I want to prove everybody wrong who doesn't believe in me, because I know what I can do. I've proven that in the junior categories, and I don't see a reason why I can't do that in Formula 1 either. Well, I just want to put myself into a position where I know it's going to be right for me and whether that's a reserve, if that's driving, that's to be discussed and to be analysed and I have the people that I trust around me who I will be consulting with and then yeah, I'll come up with some news hopefully soon. Yes, I have. And yes, he did. I don't think I really want to go more into that as I think it's private, what is discussed between me and him and all I can say is that yes, those words are moving and they're very helpful in a moment like this.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Haas
George Russell,"Yeah, it was incredible. I wasn't expecting to have that much pace but I think, you know, it goes to show all the hard work everybody's putting in and the progress we, as a team, have made in these last three races since Austin. The car has been feeling really great. Obviously, you know, difficult to know how Max would have gone on had he been on the soft tyres. But nevertheless, you know, standing here is a great feeling. Yeah, I think it’s a little bit difficult, because obviously, this is a Sprint race. And you’ve got to manage that risk, reward. So, even though I was dying to get that victory, I didn't want to risk it too much and end up with no points and starting at the back. But you know, we made it stick third time lucky. Yeah. Well, it's… I mean, it's crazy to think we’re both starting on the front row and Lewis did a great job coming from P8, so  it's going to be exciting. And I'm sure Max is going to be flying tomorrow, coming through the pack. But we're in a luxury position that we can maybe split the strategy and go for the win. Yeah, I think it's a pretty big milestone for the whole team. When we look back at where we were at the very first Sprint of the year, I think I finished eighth, I want to say, And where were you [Lewis]? I think you were maybe ninth or something behind us. And here we are going to be lining up one-two tomorrow. I think it’s really exciting. And, you know, so proud of the whole team, to keep on delivering with the car. But it's going to be interesting tomorrow. Obviously Max is the main man at the moment and those Medium tyres just didn't seem to work. I think we were confident that we could finish second, and we thought Max would probably have quite an easy run to be honest. We knew that if we weren't ahead of him at Turn 1, it was going to be very difficult to stay ahead of him. I started attacking in the early laps. And I thought once he gets some temperature in his tyres, he'll be away. And it was a little bit tricky. You had to balance the risk and reward, because obviously, you know, there's only one extra point… As much as I wanted to win this race today it’s only one extra point and obviously you're setting yourself up for tomorrow. So you had to be a little bit careful. And you know, Max has got nothing to lose, really. So he was going to be driving aggressively. But you know, definitely, it was pleasing to get the move done in the end. I think it definitely wasn't clear cut. I think we've all recognised that the soft was probably the best performing tyre this weekend in the race, which is quite odd. Obviously that means if you use the Soft today, you've got one less tomorrow. So even though Max and Red Bull didn’t have a strong race, they're probably in a slightly better position than the three of us going into the race tomorrow as they’ve got that one extra set of new softs. I don't really know, to be honest. Obviously, [there] we got pole position via a qualifying session. This is the first time we've crossed the finish line in first position in a race. It obviously is a little bit of a shame that this wasn't the race tomorrow. But nevertheless, as I said, it really goes to show the work we've done and I think we're definitely going to be very excited for tomorrow and obviously having Lewis and I one-two on the grid, is going to give us some options of the strategy. And I think we're going to have to work together to do something different for one of us to try and get the victory for the team tomorrow. It's difficult to put a number on it. Definitely the car is a little bit slimmer than it probably was at the start of the year. So that's a bit of free lap time we've gained. Probably the characteristics of the car are a little bit better. So it's definitely difficult to put a single figure on how much the car has improved. But I think the lap times speak for themselves. And, as you said, we've had an opportunity as a team to win these last three races. We were nowhere near that at the start of the year. And I think we all feel really confident that we're on the right track to getting back to where Mercedes belongs. I think that's really exciting for all of us. There definitely won't be any team orders. But I think between the two of us we will definitely be strategic to try and get that win for the team. I think as we saw in Mexico that we both did the same strategy and ultimately it affected us both. Sitting here right now, we probably don't know what the right strategy is going to be. So, you know, we'll race each other fairly, for sure. And I'm sure we'll probably be splitting the strategies tomorrow to try and cover all options. And, you know, hopefully one of us comes away happy tomorrow. But I think we, we both recognise based on recent experience, we're probably going to have to go two separate ways. Definitely conversations have been had and I think the FIA will definitely review the points system this year. I think, if any driver was to receive a race ban, it needs to be for something pretty damn serious. And I definitely don't put Pierre in the category of a dangerous or reckless driver. And a number of his penalty points have been through non-dangerous driving as such, and I don't know what he did to be driving unnecessarily slow or whatever you just mentioned, but, yeah, it would be a shame to see him take a race ban. And even if he were to get those 12 points, I think we need to reconsider it. I think the factory is going to be pumping on all cylinders across the winter and everybody's going to be so motivated to come back. This result is such a morale booster for everyone, and what we really needed to keep on pushing. And yeah, I think if we can hit our targets, the targets we've set out are absolutely the right ones. And we just need to continue on this path that we're on and see what we can achieve next year.",Brazil,post-sprint,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, we normally have a bit more deg than the Mercs and I could see them pushing quite hard. And yeah, I managed to make all the positions at the start or the first couple of laps, getting in the fight with Max and George. I had to be aggressive because obviously tomorrow I'm taking the penalty and in the end I think P2 was the maximum today. I was happy with the race. Happy with the pace. It’s just that the Mercs look like they picked up the pace a lot recently and they are very quick in the race. It was on the limit, for sure. They are so difficult to pass and I had to really go tight into Turn 1 in order to pass him. With a Red Bull, you're either aggressive under braking or you don't pass them because they're so quick on the straight that you really need to go for it under braking. I'm sorry if I had a bit of contact but that's racing and sometimes you need to go for it if you want to make it stick. I mean, we have decent pace this weekend. It's just that the Mercs maybe have a little bit more pace. It will be interesting to see tomorrow what happens when we all try the Medium like we're Veratappen today. See how that Medium behaves. And obviously we would need to pass them on track tomorrow, because I'm starting P7, I think Charles is starting P4 or P5, so we're going to need a good race if we want to beat them. Well, definitely better. We are more on the pace but I would say that  still Merc… We don't know about Red Bull, no, because Max had the Medium and seemed to struggle. But after today Merc, it  definitely seems they have the edge over us, especially in race pace again, and Lewis was putting a lot of pressure on me, George was pulling away little by little. So still some more to do in the race if we want to beat them, but at least today I managed to do a good race and get myself in the middle of them, split them. Unfortunately tomorrow I need to take the penalty, which is costly because it would be a lot better if we could start P2 tomorrow, you know, and try something but yeah, we will do our best tomorrow to make it back through the field. I mean it was good but it was difficult I must say. We finished P2 but I spent 10 laps defending from Lewis. I made it past Max, which was quite difficult because of his top speed, but I feel like if tomorrow we will start P2 we would be vulnerable to the two Mercs because they seem to have a better deg, better race pace. But yeah, at least we will be in the mix. Unfortunately, I have to take a penalty, which is a bit the story of my season. Whenever I'm strong and whenever I'm on the pace, I have a setback that weekend, which is a bit the story of the whole season, as I said, but yeah, at least I feel confident. I feel comfortable. I feel like I did a perfect race today. So I'm up for the fight tomorrow. It was tight. I mean, yeah, whenever you're about to overtake a Red Bull, you know, you're going to have to risk it on the braking. Because obviously on the straight it’s not like you can pull side by side. We were, both Mercs and I here, talking about it. That passing a Red Bull was probably the toughest thing to do. But, yeah, I had to send it a bit under braking, obviously locked up a bit and went a bit long, which ended up having a bit of contact with Max, but I think that's also fair. I think it's part of racing. In the end there was no main damages to both of us. And yeah, it reminded me a bit of the pass I did on Checo here in 2019, where I went very close to the inside wall, which was quite tight, but I made it stick. So quite happy about it. I'm pretty certain we haven't taken any step backwards. I think they've just simply done a better job at improving the car and putting downforce on the car. I don't feel like they have a lot of a gap to close in the winter, because I feel like today they were the fastest. So if anything, it’s us and Red Bull that need to be aware that, if we want to be quick next year in the race, we need to put some downforce in the car and keep progressing. Because we've seen it before: the rate of development at Merc, is second to none. I think they've been showing all these past seasons that even if they're leading, or they're on the back foot, starting the season, they're always the team that developed the most. And it shows that we need to have a good winter. And not only that, we will need to develop well during the season next year. Well, the challenge of passing Lando, that today was particularly aggressive with me – I don't know who he defended for his life and I had to make it stick. But hopefully I can pass him quickly over the line and then join the battle at the front. It's going to be, I think, exciting like it was today. Probably the order of the cars tomorrow is already more set than the order that we had today. So, it will be more of a strategic race. We will have the two Mercs, the two Red Bulls and the two Ferraris – unless something crazy happens in lap one. And I think it looks like that's the race pace of the cars. Maybe Max can go back to having a good pace tomorrow, after struggling today with a Medium. Then we need to see, as a team, together with Charles, how we can at least get closer to the Mercs, to lose as many less points as possible tomorrow, which is the target.",Brazil,post-sprint,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Boa tarde, Brasil! I'm working on my Portuguese. Obrigado. I'm so, so happy to be here. It's been an incredible week. Difficult day yesterday, but what a crowd we've had today. Starting from eighth, making my way through slowly. Congratulations to George. This just goes to everyone back at the factory, everyone here working on the ground. They've just been working so hard this year. This is an amazing result. For us to be on the front row tomorrow is incredible. So from there, we should be able to work as a team and hold off, hopefully, the guys behind. We're going to try as hard as we can, yeah. If we can have some good degradation tomorrow, hopefully some good weather, we can have a good fight in our hands. For sure. A win here for Brazil would be incredible. I definitely do. It's a beautiful place, São Paulo, and the track is just awesome. It's so good for racing with that long straight. Definitely got to be one of the favourite circuits, I think for us, for us all. Congratulations to George, this is, as George was saying, such an incredible result for us as a team. We've all worked so hard through the year. Did we think that we would be at the front, you know, starting on the front row of the Brazilian Grand Prix at the end of the year – not at all. But that's what everyone's worked towards. So I'm just really incredibly proud of everybody and thankful to everybody back at the factory for their continued efforts and for not giving up. Same with all the women and men here who’ve worked so hard, on their feet, travelling, being away, you know. This is a good day. Tomorrow, we’ve got to work hard to try and keep them behind us. No, I think we go to these different races and we get in the car and we… I think George and I, we don't really know what we're going to be expecting. And you can't really read the team as well, the engineers, they’re kind of ‘this should be OK here’ and then it's not. So they're even cautious when they tell us whether we're going to be good or not. So, yeah, our race pace was particularly strong today. So that's what puts us in a really good position tomorrow. Yeah, we have to… We’ll work together as a team tomorrow. And, you know, this is about the team. We've got to get this result for the team. I think it'd be incredibly special. And obviously, we're chasing the red guys. So it could be good. Well, firstly, this has been a very humbling week for me, being so warmly welcomed and I received my citizenship here, and the love that I received… My parents have messaged, and they're just so grateful to everyone in Brazil for the love that they have given their kid, you know. So it would be the greatest dream for sure to get a win here. It'll be tough to race George tomorrow. But we'll hopefully have a bit of a battle. And, you know, either way, we've got to make sure that we get the points and one-two for the team. I agree. Yeah, I think I'll just say that getting a one-two either way, I'm going to be a happy person, just because of how hard everybody's worked. But of course, George has done an amazing job this year, and he'll be pushing for that win – but we’ll, of course, drive carefully and clean. And, yeah, we’ve just always got to just have at the core of it, at the front of our mind, it’s the team. Getting the result for the team. But of course, individually, we'll do our best to try and get the best result. Definitely I think it has given us… we're taking a step. We know that there's some real changes that we can make with the car to get us back to a better fighting position for next season. Don't fully understand… like we've definitely taken a step forward but it's almost like the other two teams have taken a step back. I don't know if that's right or not, but it definitely feels that way. But yeah, I think we definitely know where we're going and what we need to do to put us in a fighting position for next year. So we'll be super, super focused. Everyone I know is already ready to turn up this winter and put in the effort.",Brazil,post-sprint,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was a great weekend. It's great to see how the fans are looking so much forward into it. Things didn't go that well in the casinos, so not very nice memories, but other than that everything was really cool. Really happy, you know. I've been in Vegas many times before, so it was a very enjoyable, short visit. And yeah, just looking forward. I think it's going to be the biggest event in the world next year. Yeah, it's nice. We're doing a collaboration with Disney for the Black Panther movie, which represents a lot, in the movie, a lot of my country. And the helmet itself, it's unique, and I really, really liked it. Yeah, we just want to keep the momentum going. Mexico, we had too many issues on the weekend. I really thought that a much better result was on the cards. So hopefully it can be a clean weekend with no issues and we can show the true pace that we've had for the last few races. Why is that? I thought it was looking better than that. Sorry! Yeah. Certainly it started really well. Some reliability issues in the beginning, but things were looking on track. We were in the mix for the championship early on. Certainly I had a couple of bad races that really put me off contention for the championship, so there is some work to do in that regard together with the team to make sure that we can keep that consistency throughout and that we can come back next year and fight for the title. If we were to have a similar level of car for next year. So yeah, it's important that we finish our season on a high so that we can come back next year and start strong throughout the season. I think it's good to have so many races, especially for next year, it will be interesting. And yeah, we'll see. We'll see. I think generally, São Paulo, it's always a good race track, especially for Sunday, it has been always really enjoyable, the racing. I'm constantly working on it. And I think it really depends on how comfortable I am at the start of the season with the car, as I was in the beginning of the season, then it slipped away. So I think as Formula 1 drivers, we are constantly working for new challenges, you know, all the time. But I do feel at this time I'm pretty much at my best. And yeah, I really want to carry it on for the last two races and start next year on a very high. It will be good for Pierre to miss a race! No, I definitely feel like there are things that are not even related to his driving. And we get points for that. So I think what it's not related to bad driving or mistakes, there shouldn't be a penalty and it will be really bad if he ends up losing a race for that.",Brazil,thursday,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Well, first of all very sad news, and obviously my condolences to the whole Ferrari family and his family and close friends. Yeah, very sad. You can imagine: 11 titles with Scuderia Ferrari are a lot. He's been an incredible part of the legendary name of Ferrari, you know, and building all those titles. He was very loved inside the family. So he will be dearly missed. And in order to commemorate him, we will have a sticker on the car this weekend. So we will try and make him proud. Yeah, we believe Mexico should be a bit of a one-off. We've never been so far off the pace in the dry all year. So I think it's quite clear that we didn't get it right in Mexico. It doesn't matter if it was the engine, the car balance, tyres, whatever, there was clearly something that wasn’t working. And now we focus on Brazil and Abu Dhabi, important last two races before the end of the season where we want to get the pace back. We want to get back to fight on the podium with Red Bull and Mercedes. I think it's a very interesting fight up front and keep having smooth weekends where I can learn from the car and prepare for next year. Yeah, it's been a challenging one, as you guys have seen from the outside. There was a challenging first third of the season where I struggled a bit with the car balance with the driving style, a car that for some reason didn't suit me straight out of the box and I had to fight through it quite a lot. And the second two-thirds I have been a lot happier with the car. I've been a lot more on the pace, but unfortunately, a lot of DNFs, a lot of reliability issues along the way. On top of that, it looks like Mercedes and Red Bull did have a better second half of the season. And it means that even though I'm up to speed with a car and I'm driving well, and I had a solid weekend, for example, in Mexico, the maximum I could get was a P5 five, no? So, a bit unfortunate in that regard. But I've learned a lot. I'm proud of the progress I've done inside the car, with my engineers, the way that we managed to turn my pace around. And yeah, I'll make sure next year we are back to being the consistent Carlos of 2021 and get good results. I think we would take P2. I think these kinds of things, I think they should prioritise the position in the championship, no? If not, we wouldn't be fighting for positions in the championship. I think the competition is the number one priority and finishing ahead of your competition should always be more satisfying than finishing one position behind and then not getting the wind tunnel or the money. So I hope the rules are also designed that your main motivation is to finish ahead. If not, I wouldn't understand it. I think Formula 1 got it right in principle. And in general, I think these new cars have allowed us to race closer, to be able to overtake in places and corners or in circuits where before it was always more difficult. So I think the racing is more exciting. I think the field spread is still relatively big, but as soon as these regulations stabilise I think we are all going to converge and the championship is just going to keep getting more and more interesting with the passing of the years and the races. I think it's been the right direction. Clearly this year, it wasn't, because I'm very far from him in the Championship and the way that he has performed in combination with Red Bull, they've been just the faster package: the quicker car; the quicker driver. I do feel like with a perfect year, it should be possible but we will need to be perfect next year. And we will need to improve the car.  I will need to improve, especially in the first half of the season and in the races. So that is the target – and you need to put high targets to yourself and onto the team like this. You can try and accomplish them. And then let's see what life brings next year to the table. Yeah, I think in that sense, it's been the year that I've learned the most since 2015. That was my first year in Formula 1. So then I had tougher and easier years but never such a challenging year as 2022 where I found myself in a position where I was driving with this car, I was constantly off the pace in the first five, six races, and I had to fight a lot to change some things in my driving, some things on the car, try to get the car a bit closer to my liking but also, stop having some muscle memory on the way I drive and reset a bit the way I was driving, and it took a long time. But then, at the same time, as soon as it happened, I felt like I had done a big step forward as a driver in my skills, in my development, and I had learned a load. And this is probably the part of the season that I feel more proud of, because I think it would have been very easy with such a tough start to give up on the season and wait for another car to see if I was more competitive, but I didn't give up on it. I kept pushing. And even in these last few races, I'm still trying different stuff. I'm still trying different ways to drive, different ways to set up the car and I could do in progress. So it leaves me optimistic about next year. Well, two great players that have done a lot for Real Madrid in the last couple of years. I text Vini now and then – we're on Instagram, and he's become a fan of Formula 1 and I'm a big fan of Real Madrid. I think they're going to be strong in the national team for Brazil – though maybe I don't want them to be so strong because it will make life very difficult for Spain. But they are two great players: super young, with all the life ahead of them. So I wish them the best and keep being so good, especially for Real Madrid. Spain, I think we have good chances because Spain always, since we won the World Cup back in 2010, I think we've always played well. We are very loyal to our way of playing and always tried to play good football. I think we have a great amount of young talent in the team. Will this be enough to win the World Cup? I have no idea. Because then it depends on that month, how the players are feeling. But I like our chances and I will be supporting Spain as much as I can. I feel we have chances. I mean, Red Bull has been dominant, but they've been dominant without being clearly ahead in pace and and… yeah, pure quali pace and race pace. So I don't feel like we are so far behind in terms of car development and car performance. If you think about it, I was on pole in Austin, so it means that we were one-two in Austin in quali.  So it must be that our car is actually not that far from the Red Bull. And what we need to focus on is in trying to understand next year’s tyres. See how we can be quicker in the race because it's clear that the Red Bull is particularly quick in the race compared to us. And for the strategy, race execution, tyre management, that's another step that we want to take next year that we are already working on it. But in terms of pure performance, we are not far. We just need to put on a bit more power and a bit more downforce in the car and we're going to be at the same level or faster. So let's hope that we can do that.",Brazil,thursday,Ferrari
Pierre Gasly,"That was pretty entertaining. So it was the first store opening in the UK for AlphaTauri. So we had a bit of an activation there. It was different than what we are used to and we got the chance to choose the look for Lawrence and Will for Abu Dhabi, so they're going to be very stylish journalists out there on the race track and it was a fun activation. I mean, I always enjoy hanging out with Yuki. We had two nights in London for this specific event. So a really good time. I mean, it does feel like quite a while ago, already. But obviously, every year, every single time I come back to Brazil, I can straightaway relate to the emotions that I felt on that day. And yeah, it was an amazing way to get my first podium with the drag race to the line with Lewis. Even doing the track walk every single year, it just comes back. And every time we were walking up that last hill to the line, we're just discussing this with the guys and yeah, it was an incredible moment. It's always great energy to come here. I must say I enjoy the track. The atmosphere is always fantastic. The fans are really passionate about Formula 1 and show it to us and share their passion. So hopefully we can have a strong weekend this year, again. Well, I'm not going to lie, it's a very unpleasant situation and quite delicate. In some ways also a bit embarrassing to be standing in a position where I could be banned for a race after the season that I've done. I don't really feel like I’ve been particularly dangerous over these last 12 months. And that will definitely be a harsh penalty. But there have been a lot of discussions with the FIA, trying to find a solution because personally, I want to do all the races. I want to finish the season in the best way I can with AlphaTauri. I want to do all the races in 2023 and get the maximum chances to perform for Alpine. And obviously, this is a lot at stake, because no one knows what's going to happen in ’23. I could end up with an amazing car, fighting for the championship, for example. And I can't take the risk to be banned for a race and lose all my hopes for the championship. So it's a very tricky situation. I've been discussing quite a lot with the FIA to try to find solutions because the way the regulation is written at the moment, it's quite strict on the drivers and [there are] quite harsh penalties, even though it's not always then related to dangerous driving. And definitely the penalties has massive repercussions on the Team and Drivers’ Championships, so I do hope we're going have again more conversation today, but I do hope we can find solution ahead of the weekend to avoid to end up in a silly situation where I'll be banned for a race and that would be terrible for myself and definitely not the way that I've seen the sport growing up. And I don't think that's the correct approach. Because obviously I can't really go into next year with only two points and that risk over my head. But at the same time, at the moment, there is no clear solution. So hopefully, there can be a good plan going forward for 2023. Yeah, I think overall it's been positive, I agree with  Carlos. I think in terms of racing, we've seen more overtakes. In terms, driving-wise, it seems like it's easier for us to follow on some tracks. So definitely on that side, I think they've been providing and improving the sport. On the other side, looking at all the podiums this year, and only seeing Lando managed to make it to the podium only once, apart from the top three. Personally, I was hoping that we could see a bit more variety in the finishing order, like in the top finishing orders, with maybe more midfield teams getting the chance to fight for podiums. So hopefully, this is something that can improve over the next couple of years and get the field closer together, have more teams fighting for podiums. You will always have one or two dominant teams, but at least hopefully with gaps not big enough not to give opportunities for the midfield to be in contention for podiums. So, I think that was one of the big targets. Hopefully with the windtunnel time etc, over the years, it's going to, as Carlos said, merge towards a similar performance for most of the teams which, as a driver, will be the best for all of us to give us the chance to fight at the top. We're discussing about it and any if that's possible, that will be the case.",Brazil,thursday,AlphaTauri
Valtteri Bottas,"Yeah, first of all, I think it was good to be back in the points for me. It was a long time ago that I scored last time. So even one point is for sure better than nothing. And what was positive was to see how competitive we were, especially in the qualifying, all through the weekend we were strong on single lap but in the race for sure we hoped for more and yeah, I think the tyres behaved quite differently than we expected. So the softer compound seemed to be better than what we thought and, you know, it's easy to say after the race but yeah, I think the race pace didn't quite match the quali pace, unfortunately. But like I said, it's positive. We have a better pace now than some time ago. Yeah, for sure. We try to take the opportunity. Now, with the recent upgrades we definitely have found a bit more pace. So we're hopeful that we can be competitive here and score points because it is getting pretty close with Aston, only two go so and you know, for us, either being sixth or seventh in the Constructors’ Championship, it actually makes a difference. So hopefully it's a good one. Up and down. We started really strong, then we suffered with quite a few reliability issues and some bad luck as well. And some teams were able to maybe out-develop us a bit, in a way. But I think recently we've been able to gain some momentum. In the end, it is a long-term project. We're focusing for the years ahead, and for the years ahead of us we see we can make good progress. So overall positive if we look at where the team comes from in the last few years. Good question. I think you should ask Fred! Obviously, there are pros and cons. And yeah, I think it is the fact that we're not quite fully at the budget cap. And we could do with some more cash. So for sure, that would help. Actually, how much is the difference with the windtunnel time? Yeah. For me, it's hard to calculate. I don't know the number in detail. I think still we're pushing to be sixth and to take the money and use that for quite a bit of development. And driver salaries! I also feel like it's been all positive and the direction is right. And like Pierre said, I think in the years to come, we will see it's hopefully going to get closer. That's what we all hope and in theory, that should be the case. So overall, yeah, I'm really, really happy. I think there's already been good discussions. And I think it's better to keep it internal. But from my understanding, there will be some changes made for the future, because for sure, some of the things that these guy's been getting the points, it's not dangerous. I think the points should be only given when it's really dangerous and can be harm to yourself or somebody else on track. So, I think we will see progress being made but I don't think Pierre would deserve to be in that kind of situation on the edge. But that's the rule now, but the main thing is how we act with that in the future.",Brazil,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Alex Albon,"It was very cool. I didn't have a show car with me, so I couldn't have too much fun. But otherwise, it was a really cool event. I was really surprised to see how many people actually turned up for the event. It was huge. So yeah, as Checo said, I think it's going to be a good one next year. Yeah, you’re right. I feel like we came out of the weekend, thinking… Well, let's say we did a better job than we expected. So it's kind of how it goes. You never really know, even with these cars still, with two races to go, where you are going to be in terms of the ladder of performance. So I'll go into this weekend, same as always, I actually get more confused every time, every race weekend, where we are, but I think we can go into this with some optimism and let's see what happens. For sure, it will have a small effect on it. It's better to lose FP2 here than FP1 just the way that qualifying is obviously on the Friday. I think generally speaking, it should be fine. The main concern is obviously if it's wet on Saturday and it's dry on Friday, then there might be a bit of learning to do in the Sprint race. But yeah, that will be some fun. I think we know where we need to improve. It's a lot of it's down to getting the right balance and it's a common feedback from Nicky and myself that we just need to be able to drive the car in the way that we want to a lot of times. We feel a little bit constricted by the car in certain types of corners. You know, it's one thing knowing what we need, it's another thing fixing it. So a lot of the time, I’m already talking about midway through this year, has been spent on making sure that the development for next year goes in the right place and we're making sure we, I guess, leave no stone unturned. So that's it. Obviously, right now, we're still busy in the simulator and making sure that we are going in the direction that we think we need to go in. No comment, same as everyone else. Definitely. I mean, I'm quite high up there as well and I completely agree with Pierre. I think, just to give some context to it. I think I have three points on my licence, and they're down to track limits, which is something which is not dangerous at all. I'm not harming any other driver or myself in that situation. I think I've got another two points for collision with Stroll in Jeddah, which I think at the end of the race, we, as drivers we deemed wasn't my fault. So, there are a lot of points on my licence, which I don't think I deserved. And I think… we are discussing it, I think there is going to be a change. It's obviously… Well, firstly, we've already got the points on our licence. So what happens then? Because even if we do make steps forward into next year, do the points that we just got for previous races, do they stay on or whatever? So, I think, yeah, we do need to do something about it. And I don't think any of us are dangerous drivers. But I do understand, of course, you should punish drivers if they do dangerous things, but I think a lot of the points that everyone has right now aren't because of dangerous things.",Brazil,thursday,Williams
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, I think Mexico was just a tough weekend for us. We were just really not competitive from the beginning of the weekend. But when I look back at the races, before Mexico, I think we were, you know, quite strong. Thinking back to Austin, before we had our issues, we were running P3 for a while. And then in Suzuka, we had good pace as well. So, I think the car since the summer break has been strong at many events, stronger since the beginning of the season, I should say. But yeah, Mexico for whatever reason was, was really, really difficult for us. So, I think we learned a lot. Hopefully, we come back here stronger. The altitude is the same for everybody. So, I think it's… I mean, more than that, I think we definitely understood some weaknesses of our car and things that we have to think about and improve definitely next time we go back to Mexico, but I just hope we can get back on form this weekend. I hope so. I mean, you know, it's a different track layout. And yeah, the altitude’s a little bit different, but we'll have to see. I mean, yeah, we’ll have to see. Yeah, I mean, I think it's all about having, you know, clean races. I mean, when I look back at the last few races, I think we missed out on opportunity of points, like in Austin, both cars were doing, you know, well, and I had a you know, crash and then Seb had a pit stop issue. So we lost a lot of points there. And, you know, I think it's really just about being competitive. And then, if we're fast and competitive, it's just about capitalizing and, you know, scoring points. But if we have, you know, pace like we did in Mexico, it's obviously going to be challenging, but if we have, you know, better pace, and we're competitive, then it's just about capitalizing on it. Well, I think we really struggled at the beginning of the year, I think we were, you know, far off the pace at the beginning of the year, but the guys have done a great job, improving the car. You know, we introduced a new package in… was it Barcelona? That was kind of the beginning of change. And then from there, I think we've developed the car a lot throughout the year. And like I said, since the summer break, I think we've been in a much more competitive position, we went from, like, constantly being, you know, I mean, most of the time out of a position to score points on pure pace. And then since the summer break, we've often been in positions to score points. So, I think the guys have done a great job at improving the car. We've definitely, you know, I think made big steps in the right direction. And it's just about… yeah, it's about keeping on going in that direction, really, in the future. Turns Six and 7… 7 and 8, the long, fast right-hander, whatever the numbers are. Six, 7. Yeah, I got to know him a little bit over the last few weeks. He came to Austin for the first time and yeah, super nice guy, I didn't really know him before. So yeah, super nice guy, had an incredible year in F2. So yeah, I think it makes a big step in his career for sure. Yeah, nothing more to add. And I think it's been a big improvement. Following cars is a lot easier than it used to be and we're seeing closer racing. I agree with Esteban. I think there's still too much of a gap between the top cars and the bottom cars. But, you know, that's been Formula 1 for many years so I think it's definitely been a step in the right direction. I think over time, probably, with the regulations, just naturally everyone kind of catches up, but I think it's also just the nature of F1. It's been like that for years. Some teams get it right better than other teams. I still do think however, the cars are quite heavy. I think they're still bouncing a lot. It's been improved, but I think there's still obviously things we can think about to make it even better.",Brazil,thursday,Aston Martin
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, I had a bit of everything here. Mixed emotions, for sure. But it's one of the tracks that we all enjoy, you know, coming in. It's such a legendary track, there are some corners that you don't find anywhere else. And the grip on the wet back in 2016 is extraordinary. So it's… yeah, I mean, I really enjoyed this track is probably the track that I spent the most time on gaming when it was COVID, so I was looking for massively to come back in 2021. And, yeah, we're going to be racing two times here this weekend, so it's going to be great. Well, I think this weekend is all about getting ready. And getting on top of all the little issues, getting the confidence early in FP1, because it's the last time we're able to touch the car. So yeah, getting a clean FP1. And, you know, picking up pace through quali is going to be key. The rest of the weekend is then a lot easier. No, not at all. It's been a very long season. A lot has happened. But it's not time to relax. We will relax after the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi. Yeah, it's going to be tight until the end, of course. McLaren were quick in Mexico and they tend to be quick, you know, through the year. We had our ups and downs as well. But hopefully, this weekend is going to be up. Yeah, I think it's been a good season, from where we started. You know, we were obviously looking at trying to improve the car, trying to get more pace out of it. And we clearly developed extremely well, during the season, a long time in the season as well. And all the upgrades that we were bringing were massive steps in general. And this is still what we need to keep going, for next year. We are still not in the position to be in the top five all the time, but we've touched it at times. And this is what we need to keep going more consistently. I don't know the name of it but Turns 1 and 2. What was the name of Turn 1, 2. So nice. So nice. And yeah, probably also 10. Because there's no hairpin like that, that you find anywhere else really, with the camber, with braking? It's difficult. I think the elevation changes the camber, that’s what makes this track so good. Yeah, I think it has definitely gone in the right direction. As Kevin said, maybe the thing to improve will be the slipstreaming, which is quite low at the moment. And I think the other thing that was also implemented this rule is to bring everyone more together and this is still not the case. The last car on the grid is still too far from the top car so that's probably the next step.",Brazil,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"I don't know. You know, Mexico, it’s a weird one. I think for us, it was more not being able to get the most out of the tyres in Mexico. It is, of course, high altitude, thin air and that has an effect on what kind of set-up you've run and, you know, downforce level. And I don't know if that affected us more than other teams. Certainly we weren't very strong. And, yeah, it's hard to know what you can learn from that, really. But hopefully, it's going to be a different story. And, you know, we scored points in Austin. So you know, it shows that it is still possible to score points. Although, you know, we have kind of fallen behind some of these guys that we were fighting with more in the beginning of the year, but it's still possible to score. Yeah, I don't think that the altitude is really what makes the big difference. It's always, you know, little details and the sum of all those details that makes it good or bad performance. So yeah, I don't think you can put it down to altitude. The history, I think. It's just like, when you come here there's so many kind of, you know… I remember watching so many races as a kid on this track. And it was always the last race of the season, at least when I was watching as a young boy, and a lot of great races have been here. And of course, all the history with Senna as well. And the Brazilian fans are always super enthusiastic. I just feel like it is a special place. The track is also great to drive. It's a little sort of go-kart track feeling. Yeah, always love coming here. Yeah, it's been a real journey. Of course, at the beginning of the year, we were really strong. Started the season in Bahrain with P5. And, you know, that was a massive surprise, I guess, because the team had been struggling for two years and then to hit the road like that in the first race was pretty cool. And then, of course, we had a very strong first half of the year. I think some of the other teams, like Alpine and Aston Martin, have kind of developed their performance more than us. But you know, there's no reason that we can’t catch up over the winter and start again like we did next year. We're going to get a few laps in the car before going to Abu Dhabi with it. But of course, it's something that I'm really excited about. Racing with my dad is always something that I enjoy a lot. It's such a special thing that we're still both active racing drivers at the same time. He's not that old so I feel like I have to grab the opportunity, as much as I can, while he's still in good shape and fast. So it's the first time that we're going to drive in a GT car together and I think he's going to be pretty hard to beat in that one. But we'll see. Must be really boring! No, I kind of like it. Max has a good point that the risk that you want to take in sprint is less because it decides your position for Sunday, so I think maybe a good tweak could be to separate that, so you can go for it. I do enjoy going from practice one straight into qualifying as well because as Max said, it puts a lot of pressure to find a rhythm quickly and get the set-up right. So I feel like when there's three practices, it's quite a lot. So anyway, yeah, I kind of like it. Yeah, I would say Turn 1, 2 as well, Senna ‘Esses’, pretty special kind of entry. You don't really see the apex of 1 and it always looks good when people make moves there as well from the television I think, so yeah, Senna ‘Esses’. Yeah, certainly following is a lot better now. At some tracks, actually, overtaking is not better because the slipstreaming effect is less with these cars than they used to be. So at tracks where following wasn't such an issue with the old cars, I think maybe overtaking is actually almost more difficult, because of the slipstream effect, but overall, for sure it's better.",Brazil,thursday,Haas
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I want to, but he doesn't want to at the moment, so I need to convince him. He's fully into rallying. I hope, of course, in the coming years, we can do that. It was quite eventful, to be honest. Can we skip that! Yeah, it was OK. But I had a moment in Eau Rouge. No. It was quite a big moment. It happens. Yeah, honestly, it's an amazing track. There are not many corners, but it's just the shape, the camber of the corners, just the whole atmosphere, of course, around here – the history, the fans here, they love Formula 1, there's a lot of passion that really goes into it, so I think we all love coming here. And of course, winning was an amazing feeling but even not being on the podium, in general, you know, it’s always super nice. Yeah, I think we have a good chance, of course. The car’s quick and I think this track normally should be good for us. So I'm excited and of course, I'll try to win. Yeah, honestly, I'm just not a big fan of it because I feel like we don't really race because there are a few points that you get, right, but you also know that you can't really risk it because the main race is where you really get the points. You don't do a pitstop so you just put on the tyre which will last the distance. With these cars probably the racing is a little bit better but overall you don't really see a lot of overtaking unless there's a car out of position. So then, yeah, it's not really that fun for me. Of course everyone has their own opinion, right? Just for me it's not that fun. I do like the one practice and then straight into qualifying. I don't mind that because it's less practice for everyone to get fully up to speed and you need to really nail the setup so that's okay, but yeah, I always feel a bit that when I go into a Sprint race that you're not really risking a lot and just wanting to play safe. Yeah, maybe. I honestly didn't think about it. I know that, of course, it will be six next year, We can come up with things to discuss if we want it in a different way but yeah, maybe to make it a bit more exciting, at least for me, but we'll see. Yeah, Turn 1. Just a shame that some of the kerbs, they've been changed a little bit. I remember when I did my Friday practice here, we still had a few of them… the old kerbs, which were a bit flatter, and you could really run them like in Turn 2, Turn 8 I think it is. It just makes it a little bit more special. But yeah, we don't have them anymore. I don't necessarily (expect) a rematch. We were just not quick enough last year. I think this year, it's completely different. The car is a lot more competitive. And yeah, I just see that there is a really good opportunity to win, so we definitely will try to. Yeah, we drew a line under it. So we just keep on going. And yeah, I'm looking forward to it. No, we didn't, to be honest. We don't need to talk about Formula 1. Just that it was more important, of course, also, for my girlfriend to see her family. We live in Europe, you are away from your family a lot so that was also the visit and it was nice, honestly, just super relaxing days. And you know, Brazil is a very beautiful country and a lot of different places, up north, south, here in Sao Paulo, Brasilia, so it's always nice to visit different places. Well, we had a pretty terrible start to the year, so at the time, I thought we would not be able to really fight for the championship, but then things really turn very quickly and also from outside the car became even more competitive. And, yeah, it's been a crazy year for us in terms of wins. You know, it's been really, really enjoyable and something of course, I would have never imagined at the start of the year, It's a very good question. I don't really know, don’t remember. Soon as we just started to… I mean, the Imola weekend was very good, like we had a really strong weekend. And then, of course, the gap was slowly reducing. That's normally always a good sign, but you can't afford… at the time we couldn't afford any more retirements. Of course, the gap now is very big so we could have had retirements but at the time, after already two DNFs so early on in the year we turned it around very quickly. But honestly, I don't really remember what race I thought that it was back on but I think for us, as a team, Imola was a very important weekend, to have that kind of result. Yeah. Well, I mean, it will affect us but how much? I don't know yet. But I'm confident that the team and the people we have can use that as extra motivation to try and do even better. I know, of course, they always give their best. But we have a very competitive car, we have a lot of great ideas, I think already for next year as well with the car and hopefully it's going to be enough. Yeah, definitely the racing improved. Some tracks are a little bit better than others but on some tracks it’s just very difficult to pass anyway, doesn't matter what car you use. But I think that has been the main target anyway. And, of course, there are always things that can be improved further. The ride of the cars, you know, they're very stiff at the moment and bouncing around a bit. But I think overall the rules have been pretty good.",Brazil,thursday,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, of course, that helped me out a lot for the rest of the race, to stay in the lead after Turn 1. Of course, we were also on a different strategy to the cars around us. But yeah, again, an incredible result. The pace of the car was, again, really nice. We had to look after our tyres, because it was a very long stint on the medium, but we made it work. It's amazing. It's an incredible atmosphere and we love to come here. Yeah, it's been an incredible year so far. So yeah, we are definitely enjoying it and we'll try to go for more. Yeah, I mean, another great race, I think. We knew that the first stint was going to be the crucial one for us, to keep that Soft tyre alive long enough, which seemed to work. I mean, I did struggle a bit towards the end but luckily the gap was big enough to extend a few laps. And yeah, once we put on the Medium tyres, everything was working quite well. And I think quite early on we figured that we could make it to the end. So yeah, another great race, but also it's just an incredible season for us as a team. Never thought I would be able to win 14 races in a year. But yeah, of course, I’m incredibly proud. I mean, we have a sprint race in Brazil and (laughs)… Hopefully we can score a few more, but I mean, it's not about that. At the end of the day, it's all about trying to win a championship and it doesn't matter with how many points you do it, but it does show that we are having an incredible year. No. I tried it in FP1 and it just didn't really feel great. So I think that's why we never really wanted to use it. No, no real issues. It's just that the kerbs here are quite aggressive and I was trying a few different lines and some worked and some didn't. And with the gears, I think it was just after the pit stop, I think the clutch was a bit warm. And after that it was OK. Yeah, I mean they put on a great show. I mean the atmosphere in general is incredible. The fans are super passionate about Formula 1 but of course about Checo. But it also helps a lot… You know you have that whole stadium and it makes it look incredible. It's a great atmosphere. It had nothing to do with this weekend. But this year, it's been a constant… kind of like digging, being disrespectful, especially one particular person. And at one point it's enough you know? I don't accept it. You can't live in the past, you just have to move on. At the moment, social media is a very toxic place. And if you are constantly being like that, live on TV, you make it only worse instead of trying to make it better in the world. You keep being… You keep disrespecting me, and one point I'm not tolerating it anymore, so that's why I decided to stop answering. Yeah, start was crucial. I mean, my start itself, I made a small mistake with the release, but it was still good enough. And then we had good top speeds. I mean, that probably helped a little bit to Turn One, to fully stay ahead. I was never worried that they would fly past me. But, of course, if you are fully side-by-side, it can be a bit difficult. But yeah, we managed to hang in there and it was all okay. And first stint, yeah, the last few laps was a bit tough with the Soft tyres. So, it was all about just getting to that certain number of laps. And we managed that. So, it was just good enough. I don't know. I was never really interested in stats. I just live in the moment. I just try to - of course - do the best I can every single weekend. I try to win the races and that, for me, is the most important. Every single weekend when I go home, and I can say to myself that I maximised or close to that I'm happy. But of course, a lot in Formula 1 depends on your whole package , right? And we are having a great package and I'm just enjoying the moment and I'm not that interested in keeping in touch with every stat. But of course, it is an amazing season and of course I'm very happy with winning so many races. While the focus has, for sure, already shifted to next year with the car. But we also focus on the car we have at the moment that we try to win the next two races, that's for sure. I think it's just the sport is more popular so there are more people watching, so more people are writing. I think it's just that. It's not great that they are allowed to write these kinds of things so I hope we can come up with a kind of algorithm that stops people from being keyboard warriors, because these kind of people… they will never come up to you and say these things in front of your face, because they're sitting in front of their desk or whatever at home, being upset, being frustrated, and they can write whatever they like because the platform allows you to. Yeah, that can be really damaging and hurtful to some people and it's not how it should be. What was the first bit like if I was under pressure? Well, about the stops, we left it open. It was more like we will see how the deg is going to be throughout the race. That's why we chose to start on the soft and the tyre was holding on surprisingly well, let's say like that, until four or five laps to the end of that stint. But I never really felt like I was under pressure, I was just managing my tyres to get through that number of laps. And then it was still a question mark, of course, when I went onto the medium to see how long they were going to last but within a few laps, it felt really good. And then we felt like we could go to the end.",Mexico City,post-race,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, well first this has been an amazing crowd and definitely a bit awkward this time rounds, boos all day, but nonetheless I have so much love for Mexico and for the people here and what a great race and event they have put on this weekend. I was so close, I think, in that first stint, but I think the Red Bull was just clearly too fast today and ultimately maybe they had the better tyre strategy. Yeah, not sure it was the right tyre the end. I thought we should have started on the Soft but obviously we had the opposite tyre. It was OK in the first stint but that Hard was just offset, so congratulations to Max and it's great to be up here and separate the two. Well, firstly I'm really happy to be up here and to be able to split the Red Bulls, I think, is a huge result for us. Brought an upgrade into the last race and to have kind-of close the gap a little bit - they still have the edge I think - but I don't know, I think it was amazing for us to be fighting in qualifying and have the second and third. I was speaking about in strategy about us taking a risk with one of the cars at least doing something different. I had a gut feeling that they will be on the Soft to start with and when everyone took their blankets off, everyone around us was on the Softs and we're on the Mediums. At that moment. I thought that we may be in trouble. But then again, it's a long, long race, so I thought maybe they'll be on a two-stop. But that Medium tyre just had no drop-off. So ultimately, I think they were on the right tyre strategy. But I am grateful I was able to just about keep up within that first stint. That’s huge, to be able to keep up with a Red Bull. I mean, I kept telling them the tyre was fine, but I'm assuming that they were coming into my window. Sergio had already stopped. So I'm assuming they… they were going much quicker than me perhaps. So, if we stayed out longer, I would have come out behind Sergio and it would have been all over. So, I think that's the reason. Unfortunately, at the beginning, obviously had a good battle through Turns 1 and 2 but obviously my team-mate got jumped by Sergio, so I was basically tag-teamed by the Red Bulls. It’s very, very hard in strategy when you don’t have both cars there. I think Sergio was able to come in and pull me in, which definitely hindered our strategy. Yeah, it's so, so many positives, to take from this weekend. And, yeah, this is definitely the most competitive and the best the car has felt all year – and that is truly down to the amazing work from all the women and men back at the factory, who have just been doing such an amazing job. And not giving up. I think it's just been a real showing of resilience, and perseverance. And I'm so happy to be kind-of back in that fight. We saw in the last race, kind-of, almost having a chance to win. And I don't know what the car will be like in these next races. I'm hoping in Brazil, something special may come of it. But we'll see. Yeah, I think social media is getting more and more toxic as the years go on. I think we should probably get off it, ultimately. So many people… mental health is such a prominent thing right now. I know so many people reading their comments and the stuff that people say and it is hurtful. Fortunately, I don't read that stuff but the media platforms definitely need to do more to protect people, particularly young kids and women. But at the moment, they're not doing that so I think it will just continue. I think at the beginning, tyre difference was the issue. I think the soft tyre naturally is a little bit faster in the early phases. It definitely was surprising to see how consistent he was able to keep it. So in the early phase I'm sure he was managing a little bit, but I could tell that they had the upper hand in that first stint. But then towards the end I started to close up a little bit and I was hopeful of some sort of a bit of a battle but yeah, as soon as we migrated onto that hard tyre, it was kind of over from that point. I gave you it. That's my thumbs up. I don't really have a lot to say about it. It does make me giggle a little bit to be honest, but I have tried to be really respectful over the years and for example, when you've ever asked me about who has been the better driver for me I've always tried to give praise, but it's definitely interesting to see the comments that are made, but it doesn't really matter. So that's why I just kind of put the thumbs up. I think ultimately they still have the upper hand. They're still a little bit quicker. Maybe today we were the closest that we've ever been and perhaps if we were on the same tyre maybe it was a couple of tenths a lap perhaps. But they're quite quick in a straight line and not losing through the corners. I was in his tow and I was struggling just to keep up so they’ve definitely got a little bit more in the tank than we do. But we're getting closer. I think if we had started on the soft, maybe I would have been the same distance behind in that first stint. I don't really know what else… what different we would do. Perhaps we would have tried the undercut and ultimately that would have been much more enjoyable to try something like that. But, yeah, hindsight is a great thing. I'm just grateful for the progress we have made as a team and the fact that we are now in between the Red Bulls. I think that's huge.",Mexico City,post-race,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I mean I gave my best you know today at the start. I really, really pushed hard. Unfortunately, we had a little bit of a bad stop, which prevented us to undercut Lewis. Overtaking is so difficult. As soon as I got behind him it was really difficult to follow so I had to stay in third. Yeah, definitely. You know, given how difficult overtaking was today I think that it was key, you know. I thought we were going to be a little closer but unfortunately it didn't work out for us today, but still it's good a good podium in front of this crowd. I really wanted more today but third place, it’s still a good. It was always very sweet. Unfortunately, I think today, we could have been a bit higher, you know, we had a better stop. But at the end, I think second or third doesn't really matter. As long as I'm on the podium. It was great to have all these people. They have been amazing the whole weekend. And it was just nice to finish off the weekend with a podium. Yeah, it was quite important, to make some progress on lap one. So, I managed to get George early on and then just stay with Max and Lewis throughout that first stint. And we boxed relatively early for the Medium, which was going to be an undercut on Lewis, but unfortunately, we had a bad stop. And we just came behind the Ferraris, a bit too far, and that meant that we were just… we lost too much time going through them. So yeah, that was, I think, what really prevented us getting Lewis because I could see he was struggling in the early laps with the Hard tyre, and that was our opportunity. Once you get them going, he seemed to pull away a bit. And yeah, unfortunately, there was not much I could do because every time I was getting close to him, things were overheating: brakes; engine; tyres, so I have very few chances to attack him. I use a few times ERS but no more than that. It can change, race-to-race. For now, I just want to go into the next two and aim for the win. There’s nothing more to lose, so we will try everything. It’s been a very difficult weekend with far too many issues, so we need to put everything together and then I believe we can do the next step. Well, I think the lesson from this year is that you know, it's been a great year as a team. I do need to step up a bit my race pace, mainly. Where last year was more the qualifying, I think. With these cars, you are able to race a lot closer, so I think we need to step up that race pace. The understanding with the team, with the car, I think that has come better in the last few races. So, I believe we are heading on the right track. Yeah, it's a shame how are these people can feel how they feel, because you are just a public figure and they feel they can insult you, insult your family and just sitting behind the desk, they don't understand that we are also human beings. And I think this has got to stop. And, obviously, as a sport, we need to also be responsible of what we post, by ourselves. We all have a lot of followers so it's very important that we try to get the sport in the right way because Formula 1, it's a great sport and has great values, but has to do more in that regard. And just in general, the social media world is getting far too toxic. Well it's a great challenge to be his teammate. Max is operating at a very high level from FP1 through the whole weekend so just had a little learning and trying to beat him and trying to do the stuff he is doing. So it's obviously not an easy task. I don't believe there's anyone that can come and just beat him straightaway. He's very solid with the team. He’s been here a while so I think I'm just getting closer and closer with the year so yeah, I will give another shot for next year and see what happens.",Mexico City,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was. It was a good qualifying, I think. It was a close one but I think after FP3 we made a few adjustments and the car got into a better rhythm, and yeah, to be on pole here is amazing. I know, of course, it's a very long run to Turn 1, so we do need a good start. But anyway, I think we have a quick car and that's, of course, what's most important. Yeah, it's amazing. It's incredible the passion of all the fans over here, also in the stadium. I mean, it's amazing to drive here. Yeah, Checo will be there tomorrow I'm sure. We have a quick race car. So yeah, I hope it will be quite a fun race with a lot of action. Yeah, I think it will be close in the race. I mean, normally, they have very good race pace as well. So yeah, it depends on what you can do with this strategy. But we'll look into that tonight. Yeah, it was, I think a bit of a tricky start to qualifying, because the track was a bit warmer than FP3. So I think everyone was sliding around a bit more and it was a bit more difficult to find your rhythm. So it was really like Q1 to Q2 to Q3 trying to… Well, trying to find a balance in the car again. And I think yeah, every session it got a little bit better. And I think in Q3, we finally could push a little bit more with the car and yeah, two decent laps, I think. So of course, very happy with that, because around here, it's very hard to… For me at least, it is very hard to nail a lap, just you know, it's very low grip and there are a few kerbs that you have to, like, perfectly hit to actually gain time. So it's definitely not the easiest of qualifyings always. And the same with the tyre warm-up around here. But it seemed like in Q3 we had it under control. I mean, of course, during the session, you can't really change, but it's just fine tuning a few things on the wheel, what is allowed. And yeah, I think at one point, we found a good balance. Yeah, I mean, I've started, I guess, everywhere except pole here, and we won the races, so … It is always important to have a good start around here. I think our top speed is not too bad to defend, at least, when people are in the draft. So yeah, we just need to focus on that and honestly, I think if we have good race pace, then it will be a good fight anyway, but yeah, of course, we'll try to stay ahead into Turn 1. We don’t know because we've been driving on these development tyres so it's a bit difficult to tell. But I think the car we had today, I'm expecting it to be alright tomorrow. Honestly, I think everywhere just gained a little bit. It was not like I made a mistake on my first lap, it was just a couple of corners were tiny track evolutions as well. You just try to get a little bit more time. You could see a lot of people – in Turn 2, Turn 3 – riding quite aggressively over the kerbs so that is definitely already one bit but also in other parts of the track, you’re constantly riding over them and in this low grip condition, because of the altitude, it makes it all a little bit more difficult. Even in the last sector, you’re riding kerbs so it makes it a bit more fun because you can make a difference the way you hit kerbs.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean, the team does have more today. They've produced a really great car this weekend and I think it's, you know, a testament to them for the hard work they've been putting in for so long and we saw last week with Lewis what the car was capable of and this weekend, I feel like it was our pole to have and it was just a terrible lap from my side. So sort of kicking myself but at the end of the day, no points for qualifying and excited to be back in the front row. Well, we brought an update to Austin and I think it didn't really give it the opportunity to show what it was truly capable of, but with this high altitude for drag is less of a factor and that's where we get outscored by Red Bull, let's say. They are always taking about three tenths out of us on the straight and here it's less of a factor, so that's probably why we're a little bit more competitive. I'll be going for it for sure. So let's see what is possible. It was a very difficult session for us. The car’s been feeling great every single lap I've driven this whole weekend in FP2, in FP3, obviously quickest in both sessions. And then my very first lap in Q1, it was just awful! When I was really struggling, I was driving terribly and I just had no rhythm whatsoever. So, that first lap in Q3 was kind of, I wouldn't say necessarily a banker, but it was a good lap, it was a clean lap. And I knew there was a lot more on the table. And when I tried pushing further, I just got bitten by the car and couldn't complete the lap. It started at Turn 5, I had a big, big oversteer moment. And then obviously I locked up just trying too hard in Sector 3 to make up. So, you know, I am disappointed because I feel like the team deserved the pole position today. The car’s been performing great but ultimately the points are scored tomorrow, and we'll be going for that race win. Nothing, to be honest. We changed nothing. So, the conditions changed, the wind changed slightly, the grip was a lot lower, temperature had increased. And I think that's always the difficulty with Mexico. It can easily be a front limitation, it can easily be a rear limitation, just depending on the track temperature. And with this really dark colour of tarmac, it can fluctuate very, very quickly. So yeah, it was a bit of a shame, but nevertheless, you know, we're starting P2, second best quali of the year and we've got both of us inside the top three. So, there's a lot of positives to take away. Yeah, I think we were looking competitive. Similar to what Max said: we don't really know. But we think we've got a reasonable shot. And I think obviously, having Lewis and I there at the front gives us an opportunity to maybe do something different with the strategy. And I don't think anybody really knows if it's going to be a one- or two-stop. So, let's see what we can do. I think it’s really exciting to see the progress we’re making as a team but we’ve seen our car performance fluctuate pretty substantially across the course of this season and this is certainly a circuit that probably suits our car characteristics, and because of the altitude, the drag is less penalising. Obviously Red Bull have a really efficient car and have being taking a huge amount of lap time – over half a second – at many tracks out of us just in a straight whereas here that was less noticeable so that was probably the gap… probably why this weekend we probably the fastest car so far but definitely making a lot of progress. I think it almost has disappeared. I think the couple of small rule changes that were implemented by the FIA definitely helped and the changes into next year by raising the floor edge, we're almost 100% sure that will take porpoising out of the equation totally. It's funny, there was once a time that I forgot what a race car felt like not to have porpoising and now to be honest, I forgot what it does feel like to have porpoising. So I think that also goes to show the progress we as a team have made not only to cure those issues that once seemed very difficult, but also to bring a lot more performance onto the car thereafter.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"First of all, hola! Yeah, unfortunately, the first one, which I think was quick enough for a second, I think, maybe, I don't know. But yeah, it wasn't quite good enough. And the Red Bulls naturally are so fast. But I think this is such an amazing showing and I'm really proud of my team. This is the best qualifying we've had all year. So just shows that perseverance and never giving up is the way forward. So big thanks to everybody here and back at the factory. I think generally my laps have been pretty good. So I think the last lap wasn't good enough. There's still more performance in it and yeah, I’ll just keep pushing. I'm pretty happy with that position to start to be honest, it’s a long way down to Turn 1. Let’s hope so. It was generally a really good qualifying session. No real, major issues. I mean, we had some problems with the engine towards the end in Q3. So, I think there was definitely a bit of performance left on the table with that, unfortunately. But I did the best I could. I think losing that first lap definitely made the last one very, very difficult. I had to be very reserved on that last lap, just to make sure that it was clean, because I was tenth up until that point. So unfortunately, not able to push as hard as I would have liked. But nonetheless, I think this is a great result to be second and third. It's not a bad position to start for tomorrow. And I hope that we can fix the engine problem for tomorrow. I can’t. Simple as that. I think it's going to be… Naturally, it's always a tough race around here, with the track temperatures and tyres. These guys have been rapid all year long. Even at our best this weekend, still losing out to them through straight-line speed. So, it'd be definitely difficult to get by them tomorrow, but we'll give it our best shot. And Turn 1 is an opportunity. So, we'll go for it. Yeah, it started to appear in Q2 and then it was just every run in Q3. It was basically dropping out of power on exits of corners so I definitely think we were losing quite a bit of time, I think, out of the last corner and basically out of most of the corners. Not really sure what was happening, it felt like an ignition issue but I will find out from the team. I mean George answered it. Yeah, I mean, this is just one race so of course, we've definitely made progress but you'll see potentially at the next races, the gap can easily open again. I think the Red Bull generally seems to work everywhere and ours works in only a couple places at the moment. So we do have time to try and fix it and all is not lost. Yeah. I'm hoping that the team manages to fix it for next year. I don't really know. I think it was… I was told it was turn two so just apex kerb. I think we need to look deep into it, because I don't believe it's the case but we'll see. Well, Bubba, I think, probably doesn't need any advice. I think what he's done and what he stands for is amazing. And he's been so brave and been outspoken. I saw his documentary. I’m just generally really proud of him. I think the best thing you can do is not let anything pull you down. Just keep on pushing, keep your head up, do not give up, do not listen to the things that have been saying, do not read what's on social media. And just keep believing. I think if you let those things get to you, it can hold you back. And so I just ask him to head high and don't give up. I think he's going to do amazing when he comes back. I still feel bouncing and the car is still bouncing down the straights. It's not as hardcore as it was at the beginning of the year. I think we've done an amazing job to fix it. I'm not convinced the changes for next year will change it but I've not driven the new updated floor for it. But yeah, we'll see, I guess in the following races.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was a super special moment for me, to be able to drive your own car in your own streets, you know, at home. It was a super day and we did it before I started in F1 but this was very special for the people. Everyone was so emotional about it, so it was a massive day for me. It was like 140,000, which for Mexico is not that much! But still, it was a very emotional day. They are super. They give it all on the grandstands. It's rare to see it, you know, because all around the world, in other places, of course, I see a few Mexican flags all around the world but what I get to experience in Austin and here, it's something super, super special for me. This is something great for our country, because this country, we get to show how good that Mexicans are, our Mexican people, our country. So I think Formula 1 gives you that exposure worldwide, so I'm super proud of my country, that we are able to secure another contract with Formula 1. So yeah, super happy for that. Yeah, I've dreamt a few times already about it. And it will be massive for me. Obviously, that's the target for Sunday. It will not be easy. We need to be perfect throughout the weekend. So yeah, I think all the focus will be now on the racing stuff, to try to maximise a weekend. And yeah, at the end of the day, it's another weekend with the same amount of points – but it's the most special one for me. I think in general with Charles it has been good, the fighting. It's always, really close, really tight. And you know that Charles will be aggressive, always, but always fair. And it’s something I don't believe he will change, no matter how we get into Abu Dhabi, what difference will it make because he is like that? And I don't see that changing. And I also feel like, from my side, I'm also fair. So I don't expect that to change. I think Fernando covered it super well, nothing more to add. Of course I want to win this weekend. This is my target. This is a target for everyone that is sitting here and that is coming to this weekend, also for Max. So yeah, we are all very competitive and we all want to get the victory on Sunday. So we're going to give it all we possibly can to achieve that. Yeah, I think similar to Charles in that regard. Happy to have a bit of time to spend with the family. And yeah, recover, recharge. It has been an intense season as well with a lot of races, so I'm looking forward to a bit of rest. Yeah, certainly, I do believe we have a lot in common, the way our cultures are so similar. And yeah, I believe that we love each other, you know, and also, when I go to Spain, I do get a lot of support. You see the passion they have, and it's really similar to what we get, you know, and what they do for Carlos and Fernando, it's something very similar to what I have here. Ah yeah, most convenient for the calendar. I think it's important we put, when we come to the Americas, a much together the races as possible. I mean, because going to Brazil is still a long way, it's a long way to go. So yeah, I think the most convenient would be doing the more back-to-back races when we are in America. That would be great.",Mexico City,thursday,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Well, it went by very, very quickly. Yeah, it's obviously a special milestone and I hope we can achieve a special result for that. I remember like yesterday when I first arrived in F1, in Australia with Alfa Romeo. And it was a very special moment, a dream come true. And then obviously, already from the second year, I was lucky enough to be chosen as a Ferrari driver. And again, that was another dream come true. I still have many dreams, which obviously one of them is to become a World Champion and I hope this will become reality as soon as possible. We are all working towards that goal. But yeah, I'm just enjoying it. And I'm really, really lucky to be in that position. Difficult to know for now. I still believe that Red Bull will be the team to beat on Sunday. They always seem to find something from the Saturday to the Sunday that we didn't quite find it yet. But we are getting there. I don't know whether this track will be better or worse. But anyway, I believe it will be close on Sunday. Well, obviously, of course we are, I mean with Ferrari, we are working to win the World Championship, but now we know winning the World Championship is not possible any more, we'll try to use these last three races in order to be a better team for next year, to challenge for the World Championship again. Having said that, second is better than third and we'll give everything to beat Checo. No, I don't think it will change. Obviously, if there's an opportunity, I'll go for it. As Checo will go for it. It’s always been the case. Closer we get to the season, less opportunities, you have to make the difference. But we also know that we are fighting each other, so we can take maybe a bit more risks when we fight each other. But that's what makes it exciting. So yeah, I'm sure we won't give any margin on track but I'm looking forward to it. It’s a difficult question to answer but overall I feel like we've had some very good races and some other races where we've been struggling a lot . On my side, it's not like you change a lot from track to track, what you do with the tyre degradation. So I think there are races where we've approached it in the right way and we had the car in the right window, the tyres in the right window, but as we often speak, it is a very fine line with not getting the right window, the tyres and then it has a big consequence on your race and that we just need to get to get better as a team in order to always be in that in that window where everything works. Not much to add. Pretty happy when the season finishes early. I prefer a very packed season but starting late and finishing early than a very, very long season starting early and finishing late. So yeah, happy to have a bit more time with family and friends. Yeah, I was mostly speaking about the Sunday execution not the performance in itself. But as I've been mentioning since a few races, we are working a lot on the strategy, also on the communication side of it. And this I felt like we are taking a step in the right direction but of course there is still the gap of performance on the Sunday to the Red Bull that we still need to find and improve. So on that we are working, we haven't found yet the solution but we are working well. And again, once we are focusing on one thing, we normally improve very quickly on it. So I'm confident that the results will come soon. Yeah, I agree. I mean, looking at this year, I don't think it's the most convenient programme we could have imagined. Obviously, I probably would have preferred throughout the race in Brazil next week, just after Mexico and then you have one week to fly to Abu Dhabi. But yeah, apart from that, I think it’s the right time to do so, it’s just Brazil probably would have been better a week earlier.",Mexico City,thursday,Ferrari
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, it was unfortunately quite damaged, the car, it affected quite a few different areas on the car, which obviously didn't quite play into our hands, because I think otherwise we were on for a good position in around, I think, P6 or P7 even, so would have been great points for the team having a double points finish. But nonetheless, we know the speed is there. And so hopefully we'll be able to have a bit more luck this weekend. Yeah, I mean, I don't see a reason why not. I think that our car has been performing well, under the high downforce circumstances that we had across the other tracks up to now, obviously, the high downforce here will perform like a low downforce set-up so it'll be interesting to see and feel how the car behaves. Nonetheless, you know, we're in a tight battle with AlphaTauri. Obviously, we know that Aston Martin and Alfa Romeo aren’t too far away. So, it's just a matter of trying to finish as high as possible and finish with as many points as possible each weekend. So that's really the target right now. Well, it's not difficult. I'm here to do my job. And I'm here to do it well. So that's what my main focus is on. And that's everything that I'm in control of. So, I'm just trying to do my best and yeah, that's what I'm here for. Gary's always been somebody I could always rely on and he's definitely, as you say, a very calm person. But he does, behind the scenes, like to get angry, like to show some emotions. But no, it's been great. And especially as a rookie coming in, you know, he showed me the ways, he showed me what was important and what not, and I think we really managed to build up a really good understanding when it comes to driving our car. And yeah, it's very much that we work together, to go in the same direction to go forwards. Yeah, obviously, it's nice to have a bit more family time. Obviously preparing for next year, it’s going to be a long season. So you know, preparation might look a bit different. But nonetheless, I think we'll take it and we'll enjoy the time that we have. Yeah, I guess everything has been said in that sense.",Mexico City,thursday,Haas
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I mean, it was quite a lot of positive to take. Obviously the end wasn't something we wanted as a team, but let’s say the qualifying performance. Now finally, we were actually able to reach both cars in Q3, but my lap obviously got deleted. And then with the engine penalties, we have to start a bit further down. Always knew it would be a difficult race and somehow I finished P11 after finishing 13th. So yes, somehow I finished P11 after finishing 13th or 14th on track, so I think everything is possible. But for that race, I think we have to maybe work a little bit more on the race pace. But what was quite clear is that one-lap performance. We made a huge step up compared to the last few races, so clearly the upgrade package is working. In general, I think we always had a little bit better Quali, and they have a bit more advantage on the race – but still was very difficult to predict every team, how they do – but it's quite true that the last three races from Singapore onwards, they’ve being very competitive, and they've been scoring a massive amount points which put us in a position that you know, one point away. So, that's definitely the key or the target which I do aim for: try to finish the Constructors’ ahead of them. I feel like, with the car we’ve got now, we can do that. It’s just a matter of both drivers putting everything together and fighting for that. Yeah, for sure. Looking at the last few years how slippery the track is, so exciting to be driving out there for sure. Another new circuit for me. And yeah, I think it’ll be a cool experience. Looking at the crowds on Sundays it’s going to be quite particular, and from my side, tomorrow is a day of learning, a day of learning the track, learning braking points and all that. So far, I think we have to just get ready for that Saturday, when it’s important. Make sure we don't have the same as mistake we did in Quali on my Q2 lap, so we get the position we want on Sunday’s starting grid, and then we can move forward on that. Yeah, I mean, he covered pretty much everything. It’s good for us. Obviously, I didn't get to go back the last few years, back home. And yeah, with me coming into the season a rookie, of course you need time, so I finished, I think, 24th of December, just one day before Christmas. So it's quite a tight squeeze. Not much time, but it's good to be more relaxed now.",Mexico City,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Fernando Alonso,"Good. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, we talked already after the race in his garage, and then in the stewards’ room, because we had to go there and yeah, my view is was the same after the race and the same in the stewards’ room, and the same now. I think it was an unlucky moment of the race. We move simultaneously, more or less, to the left. We were very close. I took the slipstream until the last moment. There was no DRS on the first laps after the Safety Car goes in, so I have to take the slipstream very aggressively until the very last moment. I moved to the left, he moved to the left in the same moment more or less protecting and we touched. So I think it was a very unlucky moment. In a way, I think his penalty is very harsh. But it’s the way it is. Let's wait until we have the outcome today. Obviously, I was very disappointed. It was a rollercoaster of emotions for me on Sunday: started at the back, then we were like P6, we had the accident; last again; and then finishing P7, and then in the evening, again out of the point. So it was up and down all day long. And now, let's wait and see. I think I'm very optimistic that we will keep seventh place. The FIA has been very transparent to us this year. I think the new leadership, also with Mohammed I think, doing things a little bit differently than in the past. So I fully trust what they will decide. I think there are a couple of things that are very clear, that they were made wrong from their side. So, as I said, I'm very confident that I will be P7 again in Austin. If I'm not P7 at the end, I'm sure they will explain why and we will see it clearly. So, you know, I am very, very relaxed about that. Yeah, well, first of all, you cannot appeal any decision of time penalty. So that's how the rules are written, which is nice, because whatever decision you take, you cannot appeal. I would love to have that one when driving. But yeah, we protest basically because it was out of time. And there were a couple of things that… the FIA was not showing me the black and orange flag. So, they felt that the car was safe to keep driving. The car went to parc fermé, passed all the scrutineering. Green light on parc fermé, and then the protests arrive too late. So, between all, I think there is no doubt that this was not the right decision to take. And if this is the right decision to take, it will open a huge problem for the future in Formula 1. I think fifty, sixty, seventy per cent of the cars will have to retire the car when they have an aerodynamic device that is not properly fixed because it's going to be unsafe, the car. It will open also… if 20 minutes too late is okay to protest, is one month too late? Is one hour too late? Is 10 years too late? When is too late? So that, I think, we cannot afford. So, as I said, this is a very important day for our sport. I don't care about seventh, I'm not fighting for the World Championship, but if this goes ahead, I think we will open a very… we don't want to open that box. To cancel the protest that has been admitted out of the deadline. Just, it’s simply illegal. Well, I didn't speak with a team about that, so I didn’t know that number. It felt not that hard, when I hit the ground, I was just more concerned if I was going to the left to the fence outside the circuit. Obviously the first five minutes when we were running behind the Safety Car, I was concerned that the car was not damaged, you know, somehow because they changed the tyres, the front wing, and apparently there was not damaged when they check on the pitstop. And the car felt good, more or less, behind the Safety Car. So I was amazed, first of all, about that. And then yeah, we were just recovering places up to P7, so it felt very good. It was mentally challenging to go through every lap and make some moves as well. Also, with Kevin at the end, I make a move in the same straight and I brake very late into Turn 12 on the inside, so you always have the accident a little bit in your mind: what could have been. But physically, still young, no problem. Well, when the Race Director feels that the cars are not safe to drive. We inside the car, we don't know sometimes even what damage we have, what aerodynamic devices are, you know, ready to fall behind the next car. So we just rely on the Race Director and we just drive the car as fast as we can. And yeah, we maybe need to use that flag more often, or not, it’s a decision that the FIA and teams they need to check. I think Formula 1 has changed a lot in the last 40, 50 years, there are a lot of aerodynamic devices now they are borderline in the races, so we need to make sure that we have a proper rule on that. And when you see the black and orange flag you have to stop probably and retire the car because I think it's very difficult to fix some of those decisions, maybe the front wing is the easiest one, but apart from that I think it is difficult, but what we cannot allow is, you know, thinking after the race about things, because then you enter, as I said, a wild territory. It’s like penalising a car for an overtaking because there was one car on the gravel or whatever but there was no yellow flag. So he made the overtaking and then a few hours later you said ‘yeah, but he did an overtake and this should be a yellow flag’. Yes, but it was not a yellow flag, so it's, you know, whatever fault of the marshal or the Race Director or whatever it was nothing and the overtake was made. I'm happy to finish earlier. Generally, it doesn't matter if next year is 24, it was a shorter calendar [this year] I think. Yeah, I think last year we finished very late, in the middle of December or something like that. It was way too close to Christmas. So yeah, I'm happy now with this year. Next year again we will finish later, unfortunately. But yeah, I think everyone has a different plan for winter. But it's good always to have extra time. First of January at the factory. I love Mexico. I think everyone will have their own opinion. But I don't know. I think we have very close cultures. And we have a lot in common. Yeah, and for me, as a driver, you know, when I come here to Mexico, I feel the atmosphere, I feel the enthusiasm about the race from everyone in the country. Obviously, with Checo, we see Mexican flags around the world. I think he's a great ambassador of the country, and I'm super happy when I come here. Mexico, has won the best race of the year for three or four consecutive times. So it's not only my opinion, this is a fantastic event. So you know, I'm happy to be here.",Mexico City,thursday,Alpine
George Russell,"I think it was obviously a shame on Sunday with how things panned out, for the obvious reasons at the race start and I completed the race with a bit of a damaged front wing, which didn't help things. So it was, yeah, a little bit annoying to see that race ahead of me and not being able to get involved. But I think Lewis showed what the car was capable of, and [we have] definitely taken a step in the right direction. But I think it's not fair to just judge on one event. I think this is a slightly different circuit now. So hopefully, we can go out here this weekend and try and be in the mix again. I think Mexico is always a bit of a unique one. Tyre prep is really difficult. Obviously, with the lack of air density and oxygen here, it's difficult for the cars and for the engines and I think we just have to wait and see. I think last year, as you said, Mercedes were on the front row, but they weren't competitive at all throughout the whole weekend, but managed to turn it on for qualifying. So hopefully there can be a small repeat of that, but definitely no guarantees. It makes it complicated in terms of setting the car up and getting in the groove. But FP2 is always a bit of a tricky session here, because this track isn't used often and it's quite dirty, quite dusty. And for me personally getting the 90 minutes FP2 gives you a good opportunity to sort of catch back up in terms of your driving, but I don’t think it'll be too much of a loss. Yeah, I think you obviously want to finish every season as high as you want. I think I'm probably more focused on just getting back into a good groove and rhythm. I think at the start of this year we had such a consistent run of results and every single time we hit the track we were putting in good performances whether it was on a Saturday or Sunday, and everything seemed to be running quite smoothly. But these last three races, for various reasons, have been very scrappy, most of which on my behalf. So I need to… I'm probably just more focused on trying to have a clean last three weekends and the championship should hopefully sort itself out. I think, when you're in the car, you want to get the best result possible regardless of what may have just happened. You're always going to try and defend your case to the best of your ability. Obviously, when you get the opportunity to see that incident afterwards, maybe your views are slightly different. My views weren't different. I thought I was at fault for that crash with Carlos but I'm not going to come on the radio during the middle of the race before the FIA have made a decision to say ‘I'm so sorry, that was my fault and give me a big penalty’. So I think that's just the racing driver mentality. Once the decision has been made, and the penalty has been taken, that's when the apologies came out. So yeah, I think that's really the same for all of us in that regard. Yeah, it's really exciting to have that potential of Lewis staying on for a number of years to come. I think he has proven that he's definitely not lifted his foot off the throttle pedal, and he's definitely the last few races performing probably better than ever. And that’s really exciting for me to have the opportunity to be his teammate, to go directly head-to-head with him and grow on this journey that we're on together because it really does feel like a journey that the two of us are on, along with the rest of the team, in trying to bring Mercedes back to winning ways. So yeah, I think we've got a really, really great relationship, transparent relationship and yeah, be great to be teammates for a number of years to come. Yeah, I've read the report and I’m definitely interested to see how our conversation goes tomorrow and how we can continue to evolve the sport. I think the report was very factual, and didn't really state anything that we didn't really know. There was a lot of talk about Pierre within the report… okay, he was the culprit, let's say, of overspeeding. I guess we want some answers about the double waved flag. You’ve got to lift off significantly and be prepared to stop but if there's a double waved flag at the end of the straight in Mexico and you're doing 350, you could lift off significantly but you're still doing 280. Pierre was doing 180 I believe in Suzuka. I guess we need a little bit of clarity on that and it's never straightforward, but we just need to continue to improve the sport and hopefully somehow find a way that we're not ever in a situation like that again, where maybe a car doesn't rebound on to the track or… I don't know. But let's see what the conversation is tomorrow. I don’t know, you’ll have to ask him. I think there's a win in all of us when the right opportunity arises and I think it is exciting for us as a team that we've had a couple of opportunities this year to fight but I think we have to have our very, very best day and execute everything perfectly and our rivals need to have mishaps and mistakes to give us that half a chance so I think we know where we lie in terms of overall performance. I think we're all just going out there for these final last three races to really do the best job possible and see what comes from that.",Mexico City,thursday,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, it was such a long time that I didn't score points. I think as a team we struggled compared to last year, but at the same time, yeah a couple of races I couldn't finish in the points. So yeah, I mean, really satisfied, finally, really happy I got back in the points, especially the race how I did, it was pretty good. So quite happy. So I can hopefully continue this momentum until Abu Dhabi. And yeah, I mean, lots of things are going on after Barcelona, lots of issues and penalties. So, in hindsight they are not much races that I complete the race week quite clean. But yeah, definitely happy. I'm pretty optimistic for this race week, I will say. A little bit different characteristics of the race track, especially compared to the last four tracks we done. So hopefully that brings us a little bit advantage or a better way, positive in terms of pace, and if that's the case, we'll definitely have to maximise this opportunity. But yeah, other than that, just we do normal as usual and hopefully we can score points with both cars and yeah, aiming for definitely P8 or P7 in the teams’ championship. Yeah, I mean, you know, other teams, the whole team…. We're not in like, kind of, like last year's mood, I will say, like, kind of the place where we were fighting for P6, P5. But still, we all are focusing to each job. Franz is sometimes a bit stressing but yeah, I think every time when we score points he's happy and I’ll just score points and he'll be happy. So this is on the table, so just either you have to put it all together and take the points or you know… But I think he's okay. And yeah, we'll be okay. Yeah, here it’s quite difficult and a bit risky in Turn 1 in the first lap in the race, what I experienced last year, especially when you start P13, P12, you know, obviously, you have more risk to kind of have a collision. So hopefully I can, you know, end up qualifying forwards, but at the same time it’s true that there's a bit there's a bit of risk. And it's quite difficult, especially with the altitude here and braking zone, you can’t have, like, normal brake performance compared to other tracks. So it's really difficult. So yeah, hopefully it won’t happen like last year, and hopefully I can complete the race. That's the main important thing. Yeah, but I think it's pretty difficult. Yeah.",Mexico City,thursday,AlphaTauri
Daniel Ricciardo,"Quite a bit, I think. After the race, you go through the debrief and that, but also in the days following, also a little bit today as well, just going back through the race limitations and then areas where obviously with hindsight things we could have done differently or if we had another crack at it, what we would try again. So yeah, it's obviously been like, you know, more races than not have certainly been a struggle. But I feel like we certainly took something from it since the race, and hopefully it puts us in better shape this weekend. So yeah, see what happens. But I mean, I knew quite early on in the race that it was going to be tough like it was. Yeah, I've been doing it long enough now to know that when you have it under you when you don't. And so that was I think the tough thing – just trying to try and find a way through the race to make it a more competitive situation for us. But yeah, quite early on, it proved to be a struggle. It always helps, I think. Not much has, let's say, correlated this year in terms of… As I said, it's been a tough season for sure. I don't come into a circuit relying on like previous success, but of course it helps. And I think honestly, what helps is just coming into a race weekend fresh again and with another chance, another opportunity. So that's exciting. I mean, three days ago, after the race, I was pretty down. But three days after, four days after, Thursday it is, I'm pretty motivated and stoked to get back out there. Yeah. I mean, I think there was so much about Dietrich, in terms of the way he carried himself I think also how he was always happy to be out of the limelight, I think, you know, what he did for so many Red Bull athletes was phenomenal, but he never really looked for too much praise, it was just it was just something that he was able to do, I feel like from the goodness of his heart and gave so many of us an opportunity to really achieve our dreams like that was it. I thought about it a lot and there's honestly like really two groups of people in my life that have put me in this position, you know, it's my parents and it's Dietrich and Red Bull, you know. They provided this opportunity for me to really chase this career, chase his dream, so from that, like, forever grateful but I think him as a human as an individual I think just yeah, humble, warm. It’s not often I think someone with such success maintains let's say such behaviour, such… how do I say? Just like an extremely good role model, I think, for someone who had done so much with their life and had that career. And yeah, admirable. Look it's always… fresh off a race it's always… you haven't debriefed, you haven't had much time to really assess anything other than what you were just involved in. Obviously, from my point of view of the race, and as I said earlier, like I knew from early in the race that it was going to be a struggle. I could just feel that the car wasn't underneath me and also battling with others, comparing to the others, I could feel where they were stronger and where I simply couldn't compete with them. So yeah, of course it's not the race or the competition I want to be involved in, where you feel a little bit, let's say, helpless in battle. Certainly, let's say, it's normal and natural to feel the way I did. And I think a few days removed after also a little bit of debriefs and all the rest of it… Yeah, like coming to this race, spring in my step, another chance to let's say, get it right and, let's say, fix it. So that's cool. I was pretty low key. I stayed in Austin, that was fun. Chilled. Hi Russell George. And then on Lewis, sorry. The truth is I want him to stay in the sport. He's one of the greatest ever to do it and I think competing with him, going wheel to wheel with him is fun, it's awesome, it's normally at the pointy end so I certainly wish to do that more in the future. And that's where it currently lies. So I think my future will be, let's say, I don't think it's relative to what others do. I think it's, how do I say it, like opportunities will arise when they do, but I'm not banking on anyone doing something so I can find my way. I want to take the time necessary, let's say, keep a little bit of distance to the sport and let's say rebuild myself, but then yeah, if something makes sense in ‘24, come back with a vengeance and have some fun and hopefully race at the front.",Mexico City,thursday,McLaren
Sebastian Vettel,"I think I echo what Daniel already said. I think it was six of us on Sunday on the grid who shared obviously a story with Red Bull or are still sharing a story with Red Bull, as a brand, as a team, with the Junior Team and there’s probably more Formula 1 drivers, thinking of others as well. I think the impact that Red Bull had on the grid in the last 15 years has been outstanding and probably unprecedented. I think Dietrich, to me, we had a very good relationship and what I really appreciate today is that it was always eye level, even though he was far more experienced and knowledgeable than I was, especially early on. It’s been a real shock, last week, to hear the news and a massive, massive loss. To me he’s been a great inspiration because he’s always been himself. So many things happened and evolved in his life and got so big around him but it is really his creative mind probably shaped that path and shaped that path until the very end, so it will be a huge loss for the Red Bull family, not just for racing, all of us in Formula 1, with the impact of two teams on the grid and the drivers like I said, but I think, speaking for so many other sports where the brand, Red Bull, had such a huge impact and helped kids, girls, boys, men, women along the way and helped them to chase their dreams. It’s all down to Dietrich and the idea that he had in his head, what he wanted to do with this brand and that’s what he created. It is a very, very big loss and everybody who had the privilege to get to know him and be with him again, echoing a lot of what Daniel said, extremely humble, kind and just a good and big heart. Well, I hope we can carry the momentum. Obviously the last races have been good for us in terms of overall pace. We were able to be a little stronger and closer to the points positions. Austin, in particular, we’ve been very competitive, been more competitive than Alpine and McLaren for the first time this year which was a very good and positive surprise and we hope to keep that up but we have to be realistic. This is a different track so we will see how we get on but just looking forward to hopefully sense a good car underneath me and enjoy the racing that I have left. No. It's funny you say that? I think it's maybe… I don't know if it's a thing in Formula 1 or is it a general thing in our lives nowadays that we… to answer your question: no. I thought about this decision long and hard and from a lot of angles. But yeah, I don't know if… I find it's a bit sad that we tend to swing so much now. I see the benefits of having emotions running high and low rather than just being flat but I think the judging in general, it's a bit too quick. We create a hype and too quickly we create like a massive – I don't want to say disappointment and not because of my situation now, the last races versus maybe the mid part of the season – so it's more of a general thing. But yeah, I obviously enjoyed the last two races, last couple of races more than I did maybe some in the mid-part of the season, but they have no impact on the decision. And if anything it’s a great reminder of why I love this sport so much, why I love racing so much. I had great races and I really enjoyed them but I also had races that I didn't enjoy so much and I was wishing after five laps to see the chequered flag and it didn't come out. So you still have to find the motivation in that and hang in there. But yeah, I wish that sometimes it just wouldn't swing as high and as low. Well, I think first of all, everybody is different. But we all live our lives and I think it's probably also part of growing up, I think. Turning 30 does change some things. Obviously. I'm a father of three children, which not many drivers on the grid are. It changes your perspective on life, how to explain or explain to you now in an answer why, I don't know if you have children or not, but probably have friends who maybe have children already. So yeah, I think whatever you decide to do with your life has an impact on the person you become. I think I still have the same person in me that was in there 15 years ago, 10 years ago but for sure, I have changed in a way that I've learned a lot of things, got to know new people, maybe you start to see things differently. I don't have any major regrets looking back. But I think I'm very grateful for the opportunity that I was given or had in Formula 1 to race, obviously, and compete on the highest level, but also to travel the world, to see so many different places, see different cultures, meet different people. I think it does something to you, and especially realising that the privilege that we have is not a given. And maybe I have a talent in what I do. Maybe we all have different levels of talents, but I could be born in a different place and the talent would never come out and would never shine. Yeah, I think everybody's free to do what they want and especially I think at a younger age, you're probably more focused on yourself, your ambitions and so on. But provided you're looking, I think life is there to teach you many lessons so I'm sure I could have learned a lot more and I'm looking forward to having more time to learn even more in the future. But yeah, again, it's everybody's choice. I don't remember, it’s so long ago plus the season was over when I won 13 races. So Max is obviously in a different position, because the season still goes on. So I hope in his head, he's just looking forward to racing and doing the best he can. He has a great team, great car underneath him, he has a high chance of winning the next one, the next three, so better to ask him, but for me the season was over so I didn't have to think about that. But when I had 12, I just wanted to win another one. Yeah, I’m looking forward to the briefing tomorrow but I think the key is we remind ourselves that it's about looking forward. Racing is dangerous but in these situations, the question is, is it avoidable and therefore unnecessarily dangerous? I think we need to come out tomorrow and all agree on the fact that going forward we've learned something because clearly not everything was correct.",Mexico City,thursday,Aston Martin
Nicholas Latifi,"Like I said in Austin last week, it’s all just rumours. I haven’t decided yet from my future. Of course, I’ve been exploring options and IndyCar is a series I’m considering, for sure but I’ve not decided on anything yet. I think if the right opportunity in the right series which again, at this point of time, I can’t say what the right series is because I haven’t made up my mind yet, then it’s definitely still on the table, but at the same time, if there’s not an option on the table that I feel is the right one for next year then I’m not necessarily ruling out taking a year to then put something better together for the following one. Last weekend was a tricky one, I think, particularly on the option tyre we seemed more competitive and then once we put the prime tyre on, then we struggled a little bit more and just got caught up with… at the safety car restart, I was that first car when all the midfield cars started pitting, I’m that block in the road, let’s say and kind of getting caught up in battles that, let’s say, for the sake of my own race was maybe not the best way to go about it but obviously it was beneficial for the team to just put up as big a fight as possible and we almost got some points in the end with Alex. But coming into this weekend, I think, on paper, this is going to be a very difficult track for us. The only thing going for us this weekend here is the straightline speed but again, we’re fast in the straight because we don’t make a lot of downforce, not because we are extremely efficient in a straight line so it’s obviously the one thing you really need here is the downforce because the produces so little of it to begin with and whenever we’ve needed to put on maximum downforce this year we’ve struggled compared to our competitors so even going off the experiences of last year which tend to be a good correlation of tracks we were more competitive at last year versus this year and whatnot, and this one was a struggle. I guess the good thing is that that brings a kind of optimism for trying to do a bit of a better job as there is a lot of other factors here: reliability issues whether it’s people managing PU tenths and what not, brake temperatures, so there’s a lot of other things that even quicker cars can get wrong so still, we’ve got to be there to take any opportunities that come.",Mexico City,thursday,Williams
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, satisfied in a way because we started P12, so a podium is a good achievement. But looking at the race, it's obviously a little bit disappointing. We had the pace, but then we had a little bit too much deg towards the end of the race. And yeah, but we'll work and at the end, P3, starting on P12, is not that bad. Yeah, it is, definitely, especially the first sector with so much G forces. And with the tyre deg you keep working with the steering wheel, which makes it even more difficult, but it was quite a nice battle with Checo and then later on with Max. But yeah, we need to keep working in order to challenge them a bit more towards the end of the races. Yeah, I'm extremely lucky to be a Ferrari driver and I know it's but we need to keep pushing. It’s great to be here to see so many people and so many red shirts. So yeah, we'll keep working and hopefully next year we'll win. No. It's not planned that way. But yeah, we'll try to maximise our package. Yeah, I enjoyed the first part. The very first few laps, it was all about being patient. I had a good start but then I found myself in an unlucky place out of Turn 1, so I basically lost everything that I had gained. And then it was all about being patient, try to keep those tyres to then attack at the end of the first end, which as I did, and everything looked good. We got a bit lucky with the Safety Car at the right time for us, which put us back into the race. But then unfortunately, we suffered a little bit too much tyre degradation to fight for higher. But yeah, it is it is an improvement but we need to do all the steps. I was quite confident that a podium was possible if we were doing everything perfect. Looking back, I think communication strategy has been the right one. Tyre management, we still need to do a step as I said, but we are working in the right direction. Well, I think our target is just that: to surprise each other. It's part of the game. So no, you cannot really predict but yeah, it was fun, especially in Turn 1. From Turn 11 to Turn 12 it was less fun, because I just saw Max passing on the left. I could wave at him. And that's it. And then I had another fight with Checo, also into 2012, where I knew I could take a bit more risk because we are fighting together for the second place in the championship, so yeah, it was it was a fun race overall. It's incredible to see the progression from the first year I've been here, in 2018, to now, the sport has grown massively in the US, so much more people, so much more people in Austin, much more difficult to go around the city easily! But, but it's a good sign. And I think there's a culture in the US also to make the sport a show. And this is really the way I see it now. And there's a challenge of keeping the DNA of the sport, adding the show, and I think this has been done extremely well. I can't wait to see what was going to happen in Vegas next year, which will probably be crazy. Well, I hope not. I will do everything for it to not happen and we are working as a team for it to not happen obviously.  I think it is very clear for us where we need to improve.  Over one lap, we are really strong and I think we are on the same level as Red Bull; over the course of a race, then we are struggling with tyres. So we are putting our effort into that and I hope that we'll see the result as soon as next year. Looking back at the season, there's been not only tyre degradation but there has been mistakes, strategy, communication and tyre  management is one of those things. And, again, we are trying to use these last races in the best way possible in order to challenge Max and Red Bull for the championship next year. But I'm confident we can do that because I know how hard we are working and I'm confident that we are working in the right direction. Yeah, not much to add, to be honest.  I just love the track. Obviously, it's such an exciting track. It's really, really good for racing but it's also very, very exciting on the one lap in qualifying and as I was saying before, I've only come here five times, but the five times I’ve come here it is just getting bigger and bigger and more and more people are coming, which is great to see.",United States,post-race,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, firstly, I want to give a huge thank you to the crowd here. We've have such an amazing crowd. This is the biggest crowd we've had here in the whole time we've been here, so a big, big thank you everybody. Secondly, I want to give a big shout out to my team. We came here with upgrades and we closed the gap a little bit. We were so, so close. I did everything I could to try and stay ahead but they were just a little bit too quick today. But great strategy. Great race by Red Bull. And again, my condolences to the team. I’m shattered. The car was a handful today. It felt amazing, firstly, to be in the lead. That's something we've been working so hard on as a team through the year and I felt so much hope. But it's OK. We'll hold on to that. We'll keep pushing, we’ll try and give it everything we can in these next three [races]. It will come to us at some stage so… It felt amazing. It felt amazing to even just be in shooting distance of Max for some points of the race. We really didn't know what our pace was going to be like today. I think in the first stint he was controlling the pace and it was very difficult to hold on to him. But in that second phase of the race, where after the safety car I was able to keep up with him and we did such a great job with strategy today. We were aggressive. I really am proud of the team. I think everyone worked so hard to bring upgrades here this weekend. And yeah, for a second I thought maybe we might just be able to hold on to it but I think that extra Medium tyre they had was just a little bit too strong compared to us. Honestly, it's really difficult to say whether or not… I'm sure the team will know whether we've taken a step forward compared to others. It's difficult to say whether it's compared to these guys, but I'm sure it helped. Just because you go to different races, sometimes, you know, from the last race of this race it’s difficult to really feel exactly. But I do think we've taken a step in the right direction. They've been so fast on the straight, I think, under DRS they're like 35km/h faster than us. If we're behind them, we're like, 22k faster, I think it is, with DRS on the back straight. So he came from a long, long way back. But even without the DRS, I think they're still something like 8k up on us, so we've got a lot of time being lost on the straight, probably four tenths at least a lap. And so we've got some improvements to make for next year's car. Yeah, well, we've had problems with our brakes all year. Just with separation, basically. When you hit the brake, instead of both fronts doing the same amount of work. Either the left one does more, or the right one does more, because one gains more temperature. And so we had a huge temperature split, which was basically, the left one wasn't really working. So they had to change the brakes. And it's something we've seen a lot through the year with these new bigger drums. And so something we're working on fixing that. I think we really need to be realistic. The Red Bull car has been the fastest car by far all year. And it is still the fastest car. So today, we were…  you know we're in the position we're in through a lot of the races, through reliability. You know if Charles was there, if Pérez was there, for example, it would have been a different race, because they would have been ahead of us, we would have been on the third row. And so, I think today it was great to have started third and been in position to fight, but out of true pace, they've been ahead of us all weekend. They were today and they will be the next three races. So, unless something drastic happens to any more of them, for example, then it's highly unlikely that we will have the true pace to be able to compete with them. But we'll give it everything we've got. We're working on making a car that can fight with them. But I think today shows that our teamwork was fantastic. I think, as a team, we operated amazing. I mean, he had an 11-second stop, and he was behind Charles, that just shows how much pace they had in hand, to have got past Charles, and to have caught up six seconds, and pulled three seconds ahead of me at least, that shows some serious speed. So, you know…  but there's lots of positives, as I’ve said. Honestly, I think this was our best… this one was probably one of our best. Yeah. Yeah, record crowd here. And we have two Grands Prix here in the States. We have three next year. It's growing here. And it's amazing to…  you know, I've been racing here 15 years and I always wondered why it wasn't…  people hadn't quite caught on. In terms of… because it's such a great sport, this. There's so much… it's so complex and so exciting. So, it's nice to finally see that we've finally got that reach, we finally tapped into the country and people here in the US are such huge sporting fans, and they bring in such great energy. The show is fantastic. And you know, just going on the drivers’ parade, you can see the crowd and the energy from them, super excited. When we did the Fan Zone is the biggest crowd we've ever had. So big, big Thank You to everyone that took the time to come here this weekend. And, for COTA, for putting on such an amazing, amazing event. I can't wait to come back. This is one of my favourite races. I won here in 2012, the first race. So close again, to have that potentially today. But I look forward to coming back next year. I think even though we've not had a win so far, I think it's been the teamwork, I think it's been the team spirit that's stayed strong and intact. I think it's the challenges, the tough conversations we've had. I think we've really had to dig deep, pulling together more than ever, especially after a difficult end of season last year. And with all the challenges that we've faced this year,. I take a lot of pride in the stuff and the steps that finally got Mission 44 up and running and the steps that we're now starting to see and have real impact. I think that's something I'm really proud of. And then just to be… I'm still here, the end of the season still really, really proud of the performance today, collectively as a team. And, you know, through the year, we've made all the mistakes we've needed to make, I think, to build a stronger foundation for next year. So, I think if we can get that car on par with these guys. I think we could have a really exciting year next year. What made the difference? It's a difficult one for me to really answer.  I don't really know, apart from the Netflix show, which really gave people a much more in depth insight because if you switch on the TV and just start following, it's very, very hard to understand what is going on. If you turn up for the first time, it's hard if you don't know the details of what's happening within the teams. And within a few shows, obviously, it really highlight open doors and then I think once people have seen that, then they've just gone down a real wormhole of learning more about the technology, that there's a lot of mathematics in the background, there's a huge amount of data, it's the highest technology that's around,  that would help develop… that crosses over into road cars. And then at the end of the day, there's 20 drivers that are athletes, that are putting their life on the line, weekend in,  weekend out.  And  unlike the other sports which are also exciting there's a lot of players…  in terms of athletes, there's only 20 of us so it's a very, very small group of us that get to drive these rockets basically around so we're as close to NASA I guess, as we can be. I don't know how we're going to move around Vegas already but I have no doubt they're going to do such an amazing job. It's going to be absolutely incredible. I think without doubt probably going to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest race. The track’s not going to be as great as this race, I can tell you that already. Street circuits aren't as good as the more open circuits and especially the newer circuits generally aren't as great.  This is a fantastic circuit here.  It’s a track on which you can race.  It's nice and wide but the city and the atmosphere is going to be unlike anything probably.  With all those night lights it's gonna be huge It is too early to say.  If we get into next year and they're dominating again, then yes, but the Ferraris have been quicker than them throughout qualifying. I think they've every single lap probably had better performance on the majority of a lot of the season. Now, all they need to do is pick up their race pace, and they'll be right with them. I think we've got a much, much bigger step and steeper hill to climb, but hopefully not impossible. It's been an amazing journey coming out here. I've always spend a lot of time in the States. Coming to Austin for the first time in 2012, I had an amazing race here. It was very, very near to the city. Now going into the city, seeing the growth through the city and new buildings, new hotels, just seeing so much growth within it and more and more people here. Got to see a lot more of the city over those years and feel very, very at home here. I would say this has probably been my favourite stay of the time. I stayed a little bit on the edge of the city,  overlooking the city every day, and it's definitely a place I think I could live. Whilst New York is my favourite city still, but this is a very, very close second, I would say. Yeah. Ah, awesome. Good to know. Yeah. Awesome. Good to know.",United States,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a tough one. I mean, it was all looking good. But then of course the pit stop was a bit longer than we would have liked. So I had to fight my way forward again. But yeah, we gave it everything out there today. And of course it's a very difficult weekend for us. So this one is definitely dedicated to Dietrich himself, what he has done for everyone. The only thing we could do today was win and even though after the pit stop it was not looking great, I gave it everything out there and I pushed to the limit to come back. Yeah, of course, we had a big chance to win the Constructors’ here. And of course, you want to do that in style. And I think we did that today. Yeah, it was a few corners, but this is a great track anyway for battling, like if you pass one corner, you can come back in the next and it's really enjoyable to drive here. It definitely means a lot to me, to the team, because he was so important for the whole team. He was so instrumental and, of course, it will continue, but we really wanted to have a good result today and yeah, this is of course amazing. Yeah, I mean, obviously for us it's been a tough weekend and we really wanted to win today. And I mean, everything was looking great, but with that final stop, that 11-second pitstop that was not the best, after, of course… The field was quite close because of the Safety Cars. So yeah, we had to recover quite a bit . Initially I had a good battle with Charles and once I got ahead I felt like I damaged my tyres a little bit too much in the beginning of that new tyre set, so the first few laps I was not really catching like I wanted to to Lewis. But then I think once I recovered with the tyres then I could close in a bit, step by step. And then of course, yeah, I went for the move into 12. And it was a tough few laps to get him out of the DRS. In general, I think throughout the race, you could see it also when I passed Charles, he could stay in the DRS for a few laps around here. And it seemed like it was quite powerful. So it was not made easy for us, but at the end, of course, extremely happy to win on this difficult weekend for us. I think this was actually a race he would have loved to see. So yeah, of course, I'm sad but I'm also incredibly proud of the whole team and also the way they've operated all weekend. Of course apart from the pit stop but that was a gun failure and these things unfortunately can happen. But yeah, we kept it together and we won also the Constructors’. I'm very proud of everyone also… You know, the people who don't even come to the track, back at the factory, you know, the effort they have put into this car as well this year has been enormous. And I'm very proud of everyone, you know, to secure this. A lot of swear words. I was very upset. But immediately when you press the pit limiter off you have to keep your head down and go for it. But it wasn't made easy. But luckily this track is amazing to race at as well. So it's not like some other tracks where then your race is over. This is a proper racetrack where you can pass. And also you see the first time I tried on Charles, you know, this Turn 1 is so wide but then, you know, if he opens up, there are different lines to come back at you. And it's quite tough because the corner is so wide that when you go for the move, sometimes you can't even really picture where the other car is going to be again. But that makes great racing because it gives you so many like different opportunities, pass on the inside or open it up, and then maybe have a cut back. It's a good track. They kept asking me throughout the race what I thought between the tyres? And yeah, I think through my feedback I guess they chose the Medium. And I think it was right. I don't think at the end of the day, it would have mattered a lot, because I think we were quick on the Medium and the Hard. But the Medium just lasted long enough to the end. I mean, I’ve said before that we are also doing more races a year. So they are not always justifiable. I mean, I think, yeah, we are having an amazing season, but of course when you have a great car, you can win a lot of races. But of course I'm proud of winning a lot of races, but I don't really look at these kinds of stats. I'm just happy winning races. Well, the tyres just run really hot. They’re also new, so they still need to come up to temperature. Then being behind the car in high speed corners, you have to turn always a bit more which is not great for the tyre. So once you're in clean air, then automatically they cool down a bit. So just took a few laps. And yeah, I think it was good. Like I said before, the track really lets you do that as well, because it's quite wide. These kind of corners, you can really brake deep into the corner, and then the other car can come back at you in the exit, especially from 12 to 15. Like one car can go really tight and defend the other one can really open it up. So, I think it was good racing. Yeah, I think Lewis explained that really well. I mean, I guess everyone wondered a bit like, why is it not kickstarting a bit over here? But I think the last few years also, together with Netflix, people had a bit more insight. Because I think, up until a few years ago, the sport was very closed. You couldn't really get close to the teams. I think everything is opening up a little bit more. And then because of Netflix giving a bit more insight, you start to understand a little bit more of what's going on. And you don't just see the cars driving around. I think that's why people are a lot more excited about Formula 1 now. You can clearly see… it's all over the world but especially in the US, the popularity is growing a lot. So I enjoy coming to the US and also, of course, we're going to have three Grands Prix but the three races are completely different, in completely different locations. So, I think that's also really important. And yeah, I'm just looking forward to the coming years to see what's next. And yeah, what's going to happen in the coming years. Yeah, today was a bit tricky with the wind. It makes the car just all a bit more like less predictable and also with that, of course, the higher degradation you have, because of course we were doing quite a few pit stops around here. Yeah, sometimes you get in a nice rhythm and everything just goes and there's not much really happening, just following the tyres around. But around you have  to be very focused and really [pay] attention to details, it’s easy to have a lock up or lose the rear so you had to definitely be more on it. But that's a challenge. It's the same for everyone. I wasn't here, of course at the start in 2012 but it's an amazing track. Most of the new tracks are…  you lose a little bit of the DNA of an old school circuit but I think this is really close to that because that first sector is just insane. Of course there are a few low speed corners but the track is great for racing and I think most of the drivers love coming here. Also the city is growing a lot. A lot of people are coming over here;  big companies as well. I always enjoy coming here and really see the city grow from the first time I was here in 2014 for an FP1  session to now;  it's pretty impressive. And yeah, I hope of course we can come here for many more years to come. Taxes are good, right? Yeah, it was just a rotary change which then influenced a bit the throttle pickup which can happen so we just went back to the other setting and it was a bit better. But it's something… of course we always try to fine tune anything, especially on a track like this where it's a bit bumpy, it probably gets a bit worse so we have to be a bit more precise. But once I went back to my other setting it was not too bad.",United States,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean it's been hard news I think for everyone. I think what he has meant for Red Bull but also for the sport and especially also for me, what he has done for me in general, my career so far and generally my life, you know. It's really tough. It's a very tough day and yeah, we tried of course and we gave it everything today in qualifying. Unfortunately, we missed out by a little bit. But there's still a race ahead of course, and yeah, we're going to try to make him proud tomorrow. Well, I think our car normally in the race is a bit stronger than qualifying and I think already today in qualifying it was very fine margins. If you could switch your tyres on a bit better, I think that would have made a difference. But nonetheless, you know, we are there and I'm expecting a good race tomorrow. Yeah, of course. I mean, for us it was, I think, a tough entry to qualifying. And then you don't really care about the result as well, you know? it doesn't matter because we’re more about what happened today and also what he has meant to everyone within the whole team, what he has built up in Formula One, the company itself Red Bull, and personally to me, because without him, I wouldn't be sitting here today and I wouldn't have had the success I've had. So yeah, it's incredibly tough for everyone in the team, and luckily I got to see him a couple of weeks back. So we could spend a little bit of time together. But it's still a tough day. It was alright. It was very tricky today with the wind out there, especially in the first sector in the high-speed corners, when you have the tailwind on this track it makes it really tricky. But besides that, also getting the tyres in the right window wasn't the easiest. So, we tried a few different things. I think at the end of the day, we were competitive on both strategies that we tried. Just in my first lap in Q3, I lost like three-tenths in the first corner, just hitting a few bumps and losing the rear. It was just really tricky out there. And then the second run was good in Sector One, Sector Two, we look very strong. And then I ran out of tyres a little bit in the last sector with big oversteer in the second-to-last corner. But all in all, we're still very close to pole. Last race, it was the other way around where I was on pole, but it was all fine margins. And now, you know, when you don't get it entirely together, you are P3 but at the same distance between the three cars. So yeah, I think still it's a great result. I mean, we know that we have a quick race car, so I think anyway tomorrow we should be strong. Ah, it doesn't matter if you're a favourite or not. I'm just going to have fun out there. The first one, it’s just different strategies we tried. So they were scrubbed from that out-in I did in Q2. So, it was just something to try. And it clearly didn't work out in Turn 1. But yeah, I mean, for sure the bumps around here. It’s not like normal bumps you get on a track just by running and the cars grinding. Here, the earth, of course, is moving a lot more and it  makes it quite difficult in some places to drive in general. So probably that also makes Turn 1 quite a bit harder again, this year. Yeah, I think the main issue in Suzuka was the visibility because of course, for myself, when I drove past Carlos’s car with the tractor or the crane or however you call it, you see it, of course, but when you are behind, and nobody tells you, or communicates to the teams that there is a crane on the track, and you suddenly come out of the spray, because that's the thing you do, right, when you're behind a car, I always try to go left or right to see. And if you don't know that there is a crane there, then, yeah, I can understand, of course, people get quite upset. So probably already there, knowing that we have these visibility issues, you can communicate faster and better about ‘guys, we have to send a crane onto the track to get the car away.’ I think that would have helped already a lot. So that's, I think, for sure what will change for the future if it happens again. And then yeah, the rest of Suzuka, this is an ongoing topic which I think is also not something you can easily solve overnight. And about the race director situation, from my side I guess time will tell what is right. Do you need one? Do you need two? Do you need three? Five? I don't know. It's difficult. I know the opportunity is there and I know that we have a quick car. But I'm anyway not really busy with stats or whatever, because you can't compare them anyway because also now like we're doing more races so if you have a competitive car, there's a bigger opportunity of you reaching that. So I don't like to compare to, let's say, people who have raced in the ‘70s, ‘80s, '90s, early 2000s because it's impossible. So I just focus on what I can do every single weekend, try to get the best out of myself, out of the car and if we keep doing that, I'm just happy with that stat but not about potentially winning 13 or 14 races in a year. For me, Dietrich was always super kind and caring and he didn't like to be in the foreground, like he always was there but he didn't want to be in front of the cameras. When you get to know him more personally he was super nice. He was a big race fan, but I think the commitment he has shown to Formula 1 and basically to have two Formula 1 teams is incredible and also the amount of young talent he has supported throughout all these years. And especially from my side, to believe in me from such a young age and also really see that relationship grow, year after year, was very special. And yeah, I will forever remember those… or the final visit I had with him, what we talked about, and just the time we spent during that day for me was, at the time already, very, very special but it's definitely even more special now. It was just very difficult, I think, to switch on the tyres, I think, for everyone out there. I just wanted to try something different. I mean, of course, we analyse what was the best but at the end of the day, we are still in a great starting position. Nothing is lost. Nothing is won of course today. We just have to be there. And like I said before, like I know we have a quick race car so if we have a clean first lap I know that we can have a very good race.",United States,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"It is obviously really difficult, especially with the wind, the car changes a lot from lap to lap. But yeah, overall, I did my best. The last lap wasn't the best. Carlos did a better job today and deserves to be on pole. I'll be starting a bit further back because of the penalty. But the goal is to try and come back to the front as quickly as possible. It is incredibly sad. But apart from everything that he has done in his career, which is incredible, he’s a human being and it is a really sad loss for motor sport. So yeah, all my thoughts go to the family and friends. Yeah, well, I'll give my best as always. Again, we are starting I think 12th or 11th with the engine penalty that we have. So yeah, I'll give my best. No crazy risks but if there's an opportunity I will I'll be here to take it. When you speak about such a small margin, you can always do better. But every driver can do better in Q3 when you see the lap afterwards. So, Carlos did a better job today and he deserves to be on pole. It was close. It was very, very tricky with the wind. And yeah, I won't be starting P2 tomorrow because of the penalty, so the race will be a bit uphill for me but we'll give it all and try to come back at the front as quickly as possible. Yeah. But to be honest, that's how I like it. Maybe too loose in the last corner and I lost quite a bit there but yeah, it's okay. I don't know but I will try to make some places as quickly as possible in the first few laps so I can be in the fight and join these two guys at the front as quickly as possible. It was a small cut on the tyre that we didn't want to take any risks so nothing too big really. I don't think so. We've got this FP2 run also that nobody could do just because I didn't run in FP1. So I could use the medium which gave us a little bit of data, a little bit less data this morning in FP3 but all in all, I don't think it will be a factor that will… that has compromised us for the race tomorrow. For now, to be honest, we haven't discussed it too much. There was a long paper that I haven't got the time to read yet. But I think the target is to speak about it at the next race. So yeah, I still need to go through the paper to be honest.",United States,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"It was fun, a lot of fun. Very tricky out there with these winds that we have today. So gusty that every corner is a bit of an adventure with these cars. You don't know how much grip you're going to get or how much grip to expect but I managed to put together a good lap without mistakes and yeah, pole position that was a long time coming after a few qualies in the dry, getting very close to it but not quite getting there. Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I think for tomorrow Red Bull are still favourites. I think they normally have the better race pace. They normally get us in the race because they have a very, yeah, Max does a great job and Red Bull has a very good car in race trim. But we're going to do everything we can to try and stay ahead tomorrow and win the race, which would be an amazing way to start these last four races. Yeah, it was, it was good. Right from Q1 I had a good feeling with a car. So yeah, it was all about building it up until Q3 and putting the lap together in Q3. Yeah, it was quite tricky out there, a lot of wind, which means in some corners you never know what to expect. You have to have faith that the car is going to stay stuck to the ground and carry a lot of speed without knowing what the wind is going to do. But yeah, a bit of an adventure out there, but it was cool. It was a lot of fun. Like always, Austin is a great track to drive and I always enjoy it. It's been a long year, obviously, from the beginning of the year struggling with the car and little by little making steps forward. I feel like the last five to seven races have been very close to the limit already in quali, but the pole position in the dry was never quite coming. It has been extremely tight with these two guys since before the summer break. But for some reason or another, I was falling half a tenth short, and I really wanted to make one stick and today was great to get it and get that out of the way. I think, you know, tomorrow we are going to try everything we can to stay ahead and win the race. But at the same time, we are realistic. And we know what Red Bull is capable of doing on Sundays. They are favourites in that way for tomorrow because they always manage to put a very good Sunday together with tyre management, with race execution. So it will be a good test to try and try and do it. I would love to win tomorrow. This is my target and that's what I'm going to try. But I'm also realistic that it's going to be tough out there. Well, I kept my head down, you know, and kept trusting that one day was going to come. Also, I keep trying different things in free practice to keep getting the car a bit more to my liking. I keep trying different things on driving style, on set-up, on toys, on everything you know? Some weekends I get it wrong, others I get it right and it gives me a bit of an edge, and I can keep progressing. I think keeping faith, and keeping trust that it was going to come was the key. And obviously keep making a clean lap. You know, there's been qualifying this year where I was half a 10th of pole and I had done a fairly big mistake in the last sector or in the second sector that had cost me, so also having a decently clean lab for the wind conditions that were out there contributed. This weekend, it hasn't been too bad. We've had quite a lot of degradation, I think across the whole grid. We know when there's a lot of degradation sometimes we struggle a bit more than Red Bull or Mercedes. So, we need to keep an eye on that. But the pace itself has been good. So, there's nothing to not be confident to try and go for the win tomorrow and try and put together a good race. But we are also aware that with the temperatures tomorrow, it could be a tough day out there. Yeah, same. We all decided to postpone the Suzuka talks to Mexico due to a lot of drivers not having the time to read the paper and have these three or four days to read it and comment with our teams and everyone involved to see what other ideas we can come up with. But yeah, visibility was discussed, which for me is actually nearly more important than anything else. I'm going to keep my thoughts to myself on that one, and I'm going to let the FIA know what is my preference, but I really trust that the FIA are doing everything they can do to keep improving. I’m not going to lie, it's been a tough year for them and we all want progress and we all want to go in the right direction, and we're going to do everything we can to help them. Yeah, I would like to, first of all, send my condolences to his family and to the whole Red Bull family, because I knew Dietrich quite a lot and I've been also helped a lot by his support in the past. I wouldn't been in Formula 1 without him, I wouldn't have reached Formula 1 without him and, yeah, the amount of things that he's done for motor sport, not only Formula 1 and young drivers but if you think about how many Red Bull logos are out there in all the categories from MotoGP to F1, to all the sports that you can think about and how he has supported young talent, how many people have been supported by him and by his vision, by his idea, is crazy and I think he was a super important guy, a super nice guy, a guy that I always enjoy being around and from here I want to send my condolences and rest in peace.",United States,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Valtteri Bottas,"Yeah, different win. This gravel bike race. I actually did the same race last year in Lawrence, Kansas, which was, which is cool. I enjoyed it. It's good fun. And yeah, my first win on a bike. It's always hard to know, like, why you succeed on certain tracks, but I don't know, it really is on top of my list of the best tracks in the world. The flow the track has, the elevation change, the high-speed corners, it's really something that I enjoy. But also on top of that, Austin is such a cool place, you always have a good feeling and vibe here. And great, great support as well. So it's a great weekend overall. We had a new front wing in Suzuka, but obviously in the weather conditions it was pretty tricky to prove how it was, but we think it is a step forward. And also in this race, we have a new floor diffuser, which hopefully will give us a bit of a step. So let's wait and see on Friday, but hopefully that puts us closer to the top 10 and actually we can get back to scoring again. There's obviously many DNFs, but for sure some other teams have been able to improve more than us. But I think now with the upgrade that we had in Suzuka and what we have here, hopefully that will give us an opportunity to score again. That's something that we really need. I’m in quite a same line than Carlos. I feel like rules are the rules and if you don't follow them, there should be a penalty that really hurts because like Carlos said, you don't want anyone to have the appetite to maximise something for one year and risking with a budget cap but then… I personally hope that it's going to be a strict and harsh penalty because that shouldn't happen: rules are the rules. There's many rules in F1 and there should be no difference in terms of the penalty. So let's hope so, that it's a good penalty that really, really hurts them because, like I said, I was sitting in the fight last year for the constructors. Yes, we got that but we missed the drivers title by a few points and a few millions, it can make a big, big difference. I think two favourite memories:  first points in F1 2013, which almost felt like a win because it was a long season with quite a struggle with the car in 2013. But yeah, finally scoring first time was something amazing and I had a sore head  the day after,  But then the win 2019 was from pole; to win here it's really a unique Grand Prix  to win so those two definitely good memories, but hopefully more to come.",United States,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Lando Norris,"Oh, no, definitely not. I was late on purpose just to miss the ride in, but Daniel had his moment of glory. So it was good to see. More of the same, I'm hoping for. I love Austin. It’s probably one of my favourite places on the calendar. Enjoyable. I came out already on Monday, just to enjoy some time here and to get used to the time zone as well. But yeah, good fun. Just a cool atmosphere, you know, with the people, with the places to go and visit. I know a good amount of people around here. So yeah, a lot of a lot of activities, a lot of good things and then the track itself is for me one of the coolest, most fun in a way, and has provided some good racing and some fun races in the past. So, we'll see. You know, maybe Suzuka was not one of our best races but Singapore was there and we've been on the pace in the other ones, so hopefully we can keep it up this weekend. It was a good race for them. Yeah, simple as that. They're performing well. They're doing a very good job and it’s as simple as that, honestly. They're very quick. They have been since race one this year. We're putting up a good fight. I think. We're doing everything we can. I feel like we are doing a very good job. I'm happy with the job we're doing as a team in terms of strategy and maximising the car's potential and just doing what I think is best on every weekend. So yeah, I'm happy. I think we will continue to do that, we'll continue to fight. It's not going to be easy by any means, they are doing a very good job, both drivers are driving well. So we'll see this weekend. I think it's pretty clear… but not us. I mean, it's always tough coming into an FP1, especially in a car he's never driven before. you know. He's done some of the test days in the previous car, but this one is quite a different one, on such a cool track as well. So it's not going to be easy. It's not like you have a lot of time, especially with the tyres and things, like you don't get that many laps of feeling good grip and things. But he's an extremely good driver. I've known Alex, I guess almost since karting I've known him. More personally probably in the last few years. But he's an incredibly good driver, very talented and he's in the car for a reason. He can give good insight, add some valuable details for us and yeah, help us out as much as possible. So he'll do a good job. I think first of all we’ve just got to wait and see. There's been several places where it's been resurfaced, especially in the worst places, so like the first chicane, so the first sector has been resurfaced, apart from Turn 1, and a few other places around the back. I'll be able to give a better explanation tomorrow on what the difficulty is going to be, but especially on a track where it’s so high speed, like the first sector, I'm happy. I mean, I spoke to Fabio [Quartararo] who drove here in MotoGP, and he said that a lot of the places are significantly better. It's a lot worse on the bikes than it is for cars, so if he says it's better than I'm expecting it to be a good chunk better. But it's always a problem for us. Every weekend we're having to make compromises because of ride and bumps and things like that, so the less there is, the more hopefully you can kind of benefit… it will probably benefit everyone, the smoother it is and the less bumps it is, but for us it makes a big difference. So if the track is improved this year and less bumpy then hopefully it can help us set up the car in a better way.",United States,thursday,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"I don't think I need to put any more prize to Max for what he's done this year, because I think it's pretty obvious that he's done a very good job and everyone can see how good he has performed and how well he's executed this season, especially after not an easy start of the season with a couple of DNFs, how they managed to recover and put together a lot of wins a lot of good moments through the year, keep it consistent, and be strong in the areas where we haven't been able to be to be that strong. And yeah, congratulations to him, congratulations to Red Bull because they fully deserve it. For sure. I think eight years in Formula 1 is a lot of years in Formula 1. And since day one of Formula 1 to year eight you evolve massively. For sure he's evolved in every single area. There is not one area where you haven't evolved and the way that he's managed to keep doing step by step, improving everything, you know, because there's nothing that we cannot improve in eight years. And it’s fair play to him and now he's maximising also having a competitive car, which is something that you need in Formula 1 in order to win. If not, you're never going to win. I think we have a competitive car everywhere we go to. This is a fact, I think. We are fighting for nearly every pole position. Wins are more tricky, because for some reason, Red Bull, in the race, they manage to do a step that we don't have, or that recently we don't have as much. But we're working on that. We're taking these last four races to experiment a bit, to see how we can be a bit more competitive in the race, how we can improve our tyre management. We have the next year tyres here for Friday, you know, and it's going to be a key part of understanding where we are lacking also on tyre management for next year, to try and improve. Fifth, fourth, it doesn't change my life as a racing driver. I only care about obviously winning and having a good season. I know this year hasn't been easy. The setback of Japan also was not ideal. made me lose even more points in this fight. And yeah, I mean, if I can finish fourth I take fourth, but I would prefer to win a race before the end of the year, even if it doesn't mean I finish fourth. And I think, for us, it's important to try and win, to get the podiums, to get the consistency. Obviously this would bring P4 to the table but I'm focusing more on that then then on the championship, let's say. I don't have a lot of confidence. Oh, what happened? We went silent. You were expecting me now to say something important, but I'm going to say that I'm P1 but I don't think it will last very long. I'm putting pressure on Lance and Lando here to beat me. And if they beat me, I will go back and try and beat them again. I'm that competitive. Probably the start of the season. Those first six or seven races when the car was the most competitive, he was doing the pole positions and winning the races you know. Lately obviously I got a lot of more up to speed and I'm driving a lot better the car, but also it's true that the car is not maybe at the level that it was at the beginning of the year, or let's say Red Bull has stepped it up and it's not as easy to score a pole position or a win as it might have been at the beginning of the year, no. But he's done a better job to me this year clearly, both in driving and race execution and yeah, he felt straight away more at home with the car than me. And I've been in this fight through the whole year to try and get myself to a level similar to last year. Am I there? I don't think so. I think I still have a few things with this car that still don't come naturally and I would need to change a lot of things. But yeah, I'm now at a decent level where I'm confident that I can score some good results and be consistent with it. But yeah, I look forward also to next year’s car and see if I can get straight away more on the pace. I don't know there's just cars where you drive them and you know without even looking at the lap time, you know you've done a good lap and you know there's not going to be your teammate or someone else going quicker than you. And then there are other cars that you think you've done a good lap time but you know it's not going to be enough because you've done some mistakes here or there. And then there are cars that you need to think while driving and there’s cars that you drive naturally. And this year while driving I need to think a lot. I need a lot of headspace to know that this kind of corner, I need to do it that way, this kind of corner, I need to do it the other way. And I'm sure there's hundreds, thousands of seconds that go away while you're thinking about the corner that is coming. It's OK, I can do it. I mean, I've been pretty quick lately, especially over one lap, but it's still not ideal for a racing driver. It’s not only Red Bull, right? I'm joking. There's Lance here, who is not listening! But I think every team and every driver, we just want clarity, first of all, and second, fairness. And we all know how much 1, 2, 3, 4 – I don't know what's the number – million can make to car development and car speed in Formula 1. That's why years ago everyone was spending 350 million, or the top three teams were spending 350 million, and now we're spending 150 to keep these things under control. And yeah, I just hope that if there's a penalty the penalty is relatively important to take the appetite away from overspending 2 or 3 million to waste on next year's car because you think next year's car is worth it more than the other year, and then you take a penalty for ignoring it. I don't know, I just think it needs to be fair play for everyone. And if there's a cost cap, it's there to be followed and I just hope that the FIA takes the right decisions to make sure that everyone follows it. Well, first of all, we need to see what the tyre does to the balance of the car. This is a huge factor because I always say that the tyre is the only thing that touches the ground from a Formula 1 car and the thing that gives you the grip and then the feeling and the steering and everything. So it will be super interesting to see what Pirelli has come up with, especially because every team has played its part in developing Pirelli towards a certain direction to improve the tyre so let's see.  I'm a bit concerned about this tyre blanket rule.  Everyone says that these 50 degrees – whoever has tried it, which I haven't – it's quite dangerous, and it's not the right direction for the sport. But apart from that, let's see what it does for car balance, how it changes our car behaviour and see what the main limitation becomes and if it benefits our car or not. Bobby. I think he's going to have a lot of fun. I think he's tried the 2021 car before, so for sure it's going to be a bit of a surprise to suddenly jump into the 2022 because they are quite a bit different. Also, I guess it's a new track so plenty of new things. I just hope that he does a good job for the team because obviously when you're a young driver, the main thing is to keep the car on track and give the information to the team that Charles is not able to give and enjoy it. It's such a cool day, you know, when you drive an FP1 in front of all the Formula 1 people, and sharing a track probably with his idols from the past and it's a day that I think he needs to take it as an enjoyment.",United States,thursday,Ferrari
Lance Stroll,"Some days, some days not so good, like all of us. Yeah, it was fun. We had a tough day on Saturday, so I had some work to do on Sunday and it was definitely one of my better ones. I think we're definitely making progress. We made a lot of progress throughout the year. You know, pretty much up until Spa we were not in a position to score points, unless stuff happened in front of us. And now we've been in a position where we have the pace to really challenge for points mostly every weekend, when the track suits our car. So I think we've definitely put ourselves in a much better position. And, you know, the last couple of races in Asia we scored a lot of points and we jumped a few positions in the Constructors’ and that's a really, really good thing. And, you know, it's also great to see signs of what's to come in the future. We've done a great job this year of progressing the car and that's a great thing. Yeah. I mean, I think it's all about how we do in the next races, how they do as well, and how the car goes from here until Abu Dhabi. Yeah, I think we've just improved the balance a lot. We've put some more load on the car, which always helps. So I think just a combination of those two things has helped us be more competitive. I think it's definitely important to be on the same page as your race engineer. At the end of the day, they're setting up the car to your liking and I think that that relationship and what you want from the car and the decisions that are made with setup etc is very important. But I've definitely had a really smooth transition. Ben, who I've been working with for the last year and a half, has been great and it's just the evolution of the team and moving people around. It's definitely been a smooth transition for me and I'm really happy with how things are going.",United States,thursday,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I hope I have some water, especially as it can be really hot on Sunday. So it would be nice to have some water there. And, yeah, it would be nice to get a strong result this weekend. It certainly helps. When you have a good run of races. The confidence and momentum is with you. But that doesn't mean anything. You have to go there and prove again and again and hopefully this weekend can be a good one. We can have a strong pace and yeah, it would be nice to get a strong result before the home race. It would be very nice. It's a massive effort that everyone has done, not only your track. Back in Milton Keynes everyone has been pushing so hard. Yeah, I mean, it's been a tremendous year for Red Bull and I really hope we are able to finish it on a high, because it's been tremendous, the year we've been able to have. I think throughout the season, you know, making the right calls, pushing at the right times has paid off. And I really hope that we are able to clinch that title soon. I don't know which is the best but the most special certainly has been winning Monaco. That was very special. Well, I think he clearly has stepped up in the last few years. He really delivers from FP1 all the way to the last lap of Sunday at a very high level. He hardly makes mistakes. And I think it's something that is very hard to get, you know, to be able to drive at your 100% without making mistakes is the thing that makes him so special at the moment. Yeah, certainly, this is a very special weekend because you know, there's so many Mexicans, Latins at this race and then we have also the home race coming up so these two races, I'll say are the most special weekends of my season, so I really hope I am able to have great results here. Well, we believe that we are in line and we believe that everything will come up in the right situation. Obviously, I will leave it down to my team to solve that together with the FIA, but at the end of the day, there's always teams that want to take performance out of you, especially when you are winning, so it's part of the sport and this has been forever and I just think that it will be… it's just a normal situation and everything. At the end of the day facts will come out and people will see and understand the situation.",United States,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I don’t know about the various stops… yeah, I’ve had Tokyo and LA and I got to see the Broncos,  got see my team performing. That experience was incredible, to just be in that huge arena. Firstly, the stadium is amazing but just to see a different group of fans, but all with the similarities of the fans that we have here, just passionate about their team, right on the edge of their seats for every single play. And then for me, just like speaking to the coach, speaking to the players, and speaking to the rest of the owners, about the takeover, about the challenges that we have, the things that we need to improve on, like our offences…  our defence is really strong but our offence is quite weak at the moment. You've got Russell that's new to the team and he needs more protection.  He's still getting to know a lot of the players around him. And so yeah, I like getting super deep into all that kind of stuff and also into athlete performance because these guys are huge. Some of the guys are over 300 pounds, they’re massive:  wouldn't want those guys to hit you. And then just looking into how I can play a role with that team in terms of supporting them and also the things that we're going to do with D&I within the community in Denver. And you know, and Rob and Greg and Carrie and Mellody, they're all so kind and have achieved so much in their careers so it's quite amazing to be able to speak to them and learn from them, those people as well. Yeah, I think just being in the States, I'm very happy when I'm out here. I think already when I came to Indianapolis -  was it 2007? - was a good time. But I think this track is very special.  Considering it's a newer circuit it's one of the best circuits that we have, provides great racing.  A single lap is exciting and then we get this crowd that just keeps growing year on year. And they just do it differently here, right? I would say that us Europeans are good… we're good at sports but there's things that we've learned, I would say, with the partnership with Liberty and I think the sport is growing as a whole in terms of how we put on the show. You can expect we're going to try everything, as we always do. I don't want to get my hopes up with the… a lot of work has naturally gone into the upgrade as it always does. And I'm really, really proud of everybody for the work that's gone in. But in the past we've had expectations:  oh, this is going to bring a tenth or whatever it may be, and then we struggle to extract that so I'm just really of a really open mind. I'm hoping our car just in general works better at this circuit. And I'm generally just excited. I did drive here just after Montreal in the old car which is amazing. And they’ve flattened off some of the section like Turn 5, 4 or 5 I think it is and so I'm hoping that's going to be better for our car. Are you blonde everywhere? Yeah!? Yeah, that's a good question. Well, unlike at the beginning of the year, where I said, we don't make any mistakes, we're human. And we clearly do. I think, Ferrari will also have people that have been there for over 20 years and we really do have naturally, I think, a lot of strength in depth. I think it's leadership. We've got a great leader. We've got amazing support from the Daimler board who all like racing. Passionate racers. And then I think it's the core group of people. There’s great communication throughout the organisation. Toto is very focused as a leader to really elevate people. I don't know any other leader that that I've worked with at least that that goes and says, ‘hey, how’re things at home?’ How can I help support you better, so you have more time with your wife or your husband or with your partner, with your kids, so that you come to work and be happier and want to commit more. That’s who Toto is. So I think it's that, and because of that, there's a real general hunger within the team. So yeah, a combination of those. And I'd, like to think that we're going to be the ones that are competing with them and being able to beat them again, I do believe that for sure. But I really hope that Ferrari are strong in the following years. They've definitely had a difficult year but there's been some strong signs, obviously, that you've seen this year, which has been nice to see. And it's been nice to see Ferrari doing well again. So I hope that it's more than a two-way battle next year. I hope there's at least three of us. If not, surprisingly, maybe more. Like, why can't McLaren be there? We'll see. Or even Alpine’s  been doing amazing. So we'll see. 100 per cent I do. Particularly that. The W Series. There has not been enough focus on women in sport, the whole of Formula 1’s life, and there’s not enough emphasis on it now. And they’re not magnifying enough the great work that is being done there.  There is not enough representation across the board, within the industry. And there's not really a pathway for those young, amazing drivers to even get to Formula 1, and then you have some people who say we’re never going to see a female F1 driver ever. So that's not a good narrative to be putting out. So I think we need to be doing more, and with the organisation, with Formula 1 and Liberty doing so well it’s not a lot for them to be able to help out in that  space. And I think we need to be doing more to encourage…I mean, in the work I'm trying to do with Mercedes for example, we're trying to get like 8000 young girls into the sport – but every team should be doing that. Well, firstly, I love my fans. I love how passionate they are. So, I've not been really…  I've heard the things that have been said. I'm generally looking forwards. I'm looking at how I can win another Championship. I'm not… I have my own opinions of what we did as a team and how we did it last year. And I'm really proud of that. And, belief in what we earned. It doesn't really change a huge amount. I do think that sport needs to do something about this in the future otherwise, if it's quite relaxed… if they relax with these rules, then all the teams would just go over, spending millions more and then only having a slap on the wrist, is obviously not going be great for the sport. They might as well not have a cost cap in the future. So, yeah… that’s all I’ve got to say. Yeah, so very proud. I got to speak to just over 100, I think… I ended up speaking to 90 of them because some of them go into the garage today. But I was able to… with the agreement of Stefano, I was able to bring some of these young students in. Youngsters that have never seen Formula 1 before, with the ultimate goal of really just continuing to highlight to them that there is space for them within engineering. Most of them probably not realise that through STEM subjects, there is a pathway into engineering and this is somewhere one day they can work. There are lots of other directions, you can go with STEM, with those as qualifications. So, my ultimate goal in the future… while at the moment, Mission 44 is based in the UK, I do want to expand it to over here in the States and hopefully into Africa at some stage. And it's again, just working on improving representation. It’s about really improving the pipeline, Mission 44, really the core pillars are really about progression, empowerment, and really just, as I said, just trying to change and transform the lives of the youth that facing discrimination and disadvantage. It's impossible to say what the number is really. There is no I in team, and there is no one individual that's bigger than any other people within the organisation. Yes, the one that gets to sit in the car is a part of bringing the attraction, and obviously putting the finishing touches to the amazing creation of all the people that you get to work with, but I think it's silly putting numbers on it, because it's irrelevant. It doesn't make any difference, does it? At the end of the day, it is a team and every single person in the team has to be pulling, when we're rowing all together, in the right direction with the same amount of might. Yeah, I mean, I don't think the sport’s trying to make mistakes, but we're going to continue over the years to be coming up against things and hurdles. But I do think when we talk about integrity, it’s how we navigate through those whilst keeping the core values, while being transparent. And being true to the values of what the sporting regulations have put there to be policed. And I think, you know, it can be a confusing time for fans. Without the fans, the sport is nothing. So, yeah, I think we've just got to hold on to those values. Well, thank you. I think it's been an interesting journey in trying to understand… We all have a platform, right. We all have, I'm sure, social media and we're all learning how to utilise it. We all use it in different ways and for different reasons. I think what I would say that I've learned is how to be more vulnerable, how to share more with people. I'm noticing so many people having the same experiences that I'm having and messages I get and the messages I give… I think, for example, in Formula 1 there's only 20 of us, and we're kind of you know, people see us on TV and you almost seems so far out of reach, it's impossible to meet, you know, and we're only humans, you know. We go through the same human emotions and experiences other people do in public. And I think that's the one thing that social media has enabled me to share, because I don't think it's easy to do through a camera, as such, and through interviews, necessarily. So it's been my medium to be able to control that narrative and share the journey with them, because this has been an amazing 15 years. I have grown with so many people that are within the sport. It’s a huge big family. And then there's those that come to these races year-on-year and save up to come with their families and that, and regardless of the result they're right there with you on the edge of their seat. So it's quite a privileged position.",United States,thursday,Mercedes
Kevin Magnussen,"I agree with Lewis that I think of new tracks this is one of the best. I tend to like the old tracks more than the new but it is actually a very cool track especially sector one is very fast  and you know, with these esses, although there's a lot of runoff, which kind of makes it a little less exhilarating, it's just such an awesome place to drive a Formula 1 car. I think turn five is where we put the most lateral G of any corner of the  year. It's very bumpy usually, Lewis says it's less now so with these cars I expect it to be quite bumpy. But yeah, great to be back and looking forward to it. Well, I think we generally are more happy with high downforce tracks and this is a high downforce track so hopefully we can be a bit more competitive. I think lately some of the other teams have kind of moved ahead of us in terms of outright performance but that doesn't mean we can’t fight them and have a chance against them. Yeah, I think so. It's very tight in terms of points to these guys. Even the next position up, P7, is, if you just look at the points, it's not so much but it's so hard for us to score points at the moment so it is going to be tough, but yeah, we're going to do our best, of course, Well, first of all I haven't had any influence on what's been going on with the drivers and that's totally out of my hands. If I just look at Mick, I think he has been really improving over the year. He started off maybe not really liking the car, lacking a bit of confidence but he's really gained that and lately he's been super hard to beat for me. And I think the way he's driving right now, he definitely deserves a place on the grid. But again, you know, totally out of my hands and I can only sort of just wish, wish him well. Yeah, I'm very excited. I feel like it's a great opportunity that me and my Dad have, that we're both, you know, active racing drivers at the same time. It's quite unique. And of course, it's because my Dad had me so young that he's not even 50 yet. It’s going to be great and, as long as we can, we're gonna take every opportunity to race in the same car – and I don't really care which kind of car it is. As long as I'm getting the opportunity to race with him and make these kind of memories, then, I'll take it. Well, I think in a GT car my Dad is… not many people are faster than him in one of those, so I’m gonna push like mad to try and be faster than him in this one. I think it's difficult to put numbers on it, because in some ways you could say it's 100 per cent team, you know, because F1 in F1 the team includes the driver.  F1 is, in many ways, like the most team sport there is. There's so many people that need to perform to be successful in this sport. So I don't think it's easy to say any kind of percentage.",United States,thursday,Haas
Alex Albon,"First time. Don’t they say blondes have more fun? I don't know. Is that the thing? That's what the blondes tell me anyway. Blonde everywhere. Oh! I was like, yeah Lewis, can’t you see the sides are blonde, everything’s blonde. Yeah,  I think going into this circuit it's maybe less complimentary of our car. But let's wait and see. Obviously, I think it's going to be quite windy as well, which, again, is maybe not too favourable. But I don't want to sound too negative. I think we can do a good job if the cars strong in FP1, I'm sure we can try and keep that and yeah, let's see. Not too sure to be honest. I think he's obviously been hard at work at the factory getting ready for tomorrow and I think he's there quite a lot actually. He's really there more than I am so he's hard at work. I'm sure he will enjoy it. It's a cool track to come on and obviously it will be a home race for him so it's always nice to drive an F1 car and I'm sure it will be special for him. Yeah, I think the two have said it. It’s pretty much around that ballpark number. Nothing more to add.",United States,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, I was little bit afraid they would fall on my head because it's very heavy, it's about seven kilos I think. The guys at the team they've done a good job to hold it in place. But what an emotion to just be driving a Formula 1 kind in the streets of Paris and to deliver it inside the theatre and then it got won by Karim Benzema, who's obviously a French player, made history again. So yeah, it's been awesome,  it's been an awesome experience for me. I think it's been a good race for sure. I mean, we had fun with Lewis the whole race. I had a lot of fun fighting with him. And yeah, great to obviously bring some great points for the team. Taking that fourth place back in the Championship is very important for us. And it really showed that we stepped-up, you know, as a team with the performance upgrades that we bring. We have one more, this weekend, upgrade. So yeah, I mean, it's really going in the right direction at the moment, and hopefully we can keep that momentum going. No reason why it shouldn't. We just obviously need to be careful, because last year, it hasn't been a good weekend for us. So that's the little thing that we are keeping in our head. You know, we've done a lot of analysis from last year looking at everything. Obviously that didn't go as planned. But clearly, we have a much faster car now and hopefully it will be a strong weekend again. Yeah,I was gonna say the same as Pierre. Obviously, it hasn't moved enough in that direction. I think everything that has been in place now, in Formula 1, with… I was gonna say cost cap, but let's keep it to that, that should help obviously for the future, to make just everyone closer, but it's not close enough yet for us all and I think it would be more fun if we could all fight at the front.",United States,thursday,Alpine
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, I guess we could call it like that. Yeah. Well, I'm a big football fan. So it was obviously very special to attend the whole ceremony. Even more special night, as Esteban mentioned, Karim Benzema, French player won the Ballon d'Or after 24 years, I think, since Zidane won it. So it was, it was very special. Pretty much all my favourite football players were attending as well. So a very special night. Yeah, I must say it's a place which I really like. I think it's mainly their mentality, their lifestyle, the entertainment, just the way that they are. They're extremely friendly people. They know how to make you feel at ease, and I must say, I love the accent. I can't… I don't have the talent, not like Daniel, especially the Texan accent, I need to learn that from him, but it's a very unique place. And I've really enjoyed it. So I must say it… did he come with a horse this morning? I thought that was photoshopped, initially when I saw that! I've never seen a horse inside F1 paddock – that’s the sort of thing that happens in America.  And I must say, I really enjoyed it. Well, we know it's a tight battle. We know it hasn't been easy for us this season to score points and it's very tight with Haas, Aston has been extremely fast recently and scoring a lot of points. So, I think our mentality is more to go race by race and just try to give everything we have, every single weekend. And then we'll see the points at the end of the year. But Austin is kind of high-speed track, high downforce, which doesn't suit our car so well. But everything can happen. So, we'll try our best and hopefully can score points. I'll go 90-10. Yeah, for now. Hopefully one day we can change things around – but for now I will say that.",United States,thursday,AlphaTauri
Max Verstappen,"Exactly. I mean, I was just very happy that we had a race because leaving here without the race would have been terrible. And I mean, the championship, of course, it would have been great to win here but we have a great opportunity of course for the next race. Very special to do it here in front of all the Honda people, the Japanese fans. Incredible! It's crazy. I mean, very mixed emotions, of course, by first of all winning the race, but you know, looking back now, winning the championship, what a year we've had so far, it's been incredible. And something I could have never imagined happening after last year already, you know – fighting until the end, and having such a good car again this year. So, you know, I'm so thankful to everyone who has been contributing to the success, of course, the whole team who is here, but also back at the factory who is constantly working flat out, and they're never missing any motivation to try and make the car faster. And so yeah, and besides that, I mean, that's, of course, from the car side, the work we've done together with Honda, all the way through, every year just constantly improving rapidly and, you know, to win now twice with them, it's very emotional, especially also here, with everyone watching. It gives you a little bit more pressure, but it's good pressure, it's positive pressure. And so that's why I'm very proud, you know, that we could do it here. I think the first one is always a little bit more emotional. But the second one is probably even more beautiful, just the way that we… Well, the season we've had with the wins and just the great races and the teamwork, the 1-2s we have had and of course, we're leading the constructors, so we really want to focus on that as well, to try and secure that. So it's been a pretty special year and I think, yeah, it's something you really have to remind yourself of, because these kinds of years you don't have very often. Yeah, of course it’s a great feeling. Of course when I crossed the line I didn’t believe that we would have won the title right there because I also didn’t know if we were going to get full points or not but nevertheless, great day. At the end, we could race and the race itself we could manage really well with the car, with the tyres so of course very happy to win here. But then of course I found out – due to of course the five seconds of Charles as well – that would give me the title, but then I was yes? No? I think not everyone was 100 percent sure. At the end it was so yeah, very pleased but it also makes you reflect on the whole season and we had a lot of very special moments, of course. But it's also very important to look back at what the whole team has achieved and something that is, I think, pretty special and doesn't really happen that many times. And that's why I think you really have to enjoy the moment and really appreciate the whole team around you, as well. We're all travelling a lot and everyone is working very hard towards the same goal. And yeah, I'm pretty sure that it will be very hard to try and replicate a season like this. Yeah, I had a terrible start but I already had terrible starts to the grid, so I knew it was not going to be amazing and that's exactly what happened but then I think the outside line into turn one/two is a little bit better because there's quite a bit of grip on the outside so that's where I could break a little bit later. But yeah, it was very close but that's, I think, what people like to see That first lap I think was really the limit on an intermediate but it kept on raining quite heavily at the time so once the Safety Car came out because of the crashes, yeah, it was too wet even for an extreme tyre. If you would have continued like that it's impossible to drive and I'm in the lead, you know, the cars behind you can't see anything. So yeah, it was very difficult and they made the right call. Then the first time they tried to restart it, I think that was definitely not right because it basically just kept on raining harder and harder and there was no real sign of the track being dry or dry enough to drive and I think once we actually got going it was fine. There were a few rivers but we very quickly switched from the extreme to an intermediate anyway so that was definitely the right call. Yeah, the car was very good but it was also… we were looking after the tyres I think quite well. We could keep the front tyres alive which around here is quite tough on these intermediate tyres. And that's basically I think what gave me such a pace advantage because in that first sector if you have a bit more front grip that helps a lot, but yeah, it was it was very enjoyable. But anyway this track in that kind of condition, with the intermediate it's also in the wet a really nice track to drive. Of course, I arrived there first and I saw the crane and I have perfect visibility but when you're behind, you always try to drive out of the spray: you go left or you go right, because you can't really see anything and that is when things happen. You drive suddenly left and suddenly you can see a crane or whatever, that would be very dangerous at any speed. So that's definitely something we need to improve. Yeah, like I mentioned before, that first start was fine for that first lap but then very quickly, because of the hard rain we had at the time, it just became undriveable. And then the second start we did was fine, yeah. I didn't want to take a dig out of everyone but I think we need better rain tyres. If you saw what we could do in the ‘90s or the early 2000s, with the amount of water on the track. I'm very happy to have a few test days, you know, and try all different kinds of tyres but we need better rain tyres because I think the extremes are just slow and they can't really carry a lot of water away. That's why everyone always tries to switch very quickly to an intermediate because it's just so much faster per lap, like you could see from one to the other lap, we went from the extreme to the inter today and we immediately went five seconds at least faster and that is just too big. And that's why nobody really wants to run that extreme. And when it rained like it did when the red flag came out and you would have put extreme tyres on, I think it would still be really difficult to drive. But then if you compare that to 20 years ago, that would have been perfectly fine. So there must be a solution. Like I said, this is not criticism because I'm very happy to help out. We should look into it. Maybe we can just organise more tests days in the wet and work together, to try and find better tyres to at least have an opportunity to really drive in the wet and not always only drive like two laps on an extreme, switch to intermediate and call it a wet race because a wet race is also normally driven with heavy rain. Yeah, totally. I mean, very different emotions, of course. But also, that's because of the whole season anyway being very different. And you're already starting with completely different cars, completely different way of racing. And then, of course, also, the amount of races we've won. But also they all came in quite a different way. Like, last year it was all really qualifying dependent, and that's how you would normally win a race. Now, even with some engine penalties, it was coming back to the front, it's really been an enjoyable year. And of course, a very special year, which will be very hard, I think, in the future to match from myself, I think as well. That's why I think we really have to appreciate it and really enjoy it. We were enjoying it already, probably now we can just enjoy it a little bit more. it would have been perfect. So yeah, it is, at the moment it does feel perfect. Because it's not only because of just, you know, that we are driving with Honda, you know, we've been really working together with them now for a few years, and with all the Japanese fans around. It's also where we came from together. Because I think everyone, or most people, told us we were crazy when we started to work with them back in the day, is it going to work out, you know, because they had a tough time at that time. But you see, never give up and full dedication to make it work, and that's what happened. Of course, already last year, we were very competitive, but even better this year. And that's why I'm really proud of the whole team and I'm also very proud of everyone within Honda for that mentality. Because it's hard when you have a lot of criticism on you. And there's a lot of pressure, because people are demanding a lot and you need to perform, and you need to show results. But I think they stayed calm and they knew what they had to do, eventually, and look where we are now. I think I have to go for the Spa weekend. Because I think that was just total dominance, which, yeah, these kinds of weekends, they very rarely happen like that. And especially when I came home that night, you know, you start to reflect a bit on the weekend. And you realise that was, yeah, pretty crazy and pretty special. The main low moments were in the beginning of the season with the retirements, because you know, even if you have a little bit of a bad race, you always have to score points, right. And retiring is the worst thing that can happen. I mean, there were a few moments where I thought, you know, we have a good chance of winning it. But I think the moment where I thought now we are going to win it was I think after Paul Ricard, where the lead, you know, increased by quite a bit. We had a quite competitive car, I knew it was going to be quite close, you know, in the coming races, but I was like, you know, this is a gap which we cannot give away anymore. Yeah, absolutely. That is the next target. And I'm going to give it everything I have, of course, to make sure that we're going to win that one as well. Yeah, I mean, naturally, when you're in such a close battle, some other teams who are not in that battle can start earlier, right, because they have not really a lot to gain in that year. So that's why we always thought, you know, the start of the season might be a little bit more difficult. But I think already with that start of the season we had, we were actually positively surprised that we were that competitive. But then it's all about… Even when you're probably not where you want to be fully, it's all about scoring points, and we were not doing that. So that was definitely a bit disappointing. But at the other end, we all stayed calm. Of course, we were not happy about what was happening. But we still believed in everything. And yeah, we stayed calm, improved the car, got rid of some weight in the car and yeah, just kept working towards the same direction, the same goal and that's why we are here now. Like I said before, it's just different, because of the whole season. I mean, already last year was very special for me winning a title. But this year has been… anyway, already because of the cars being very different. But also the way we were working as a team with… Okay, we had a tough start, but I think after that we really worked well as a team. We barely made any mistakes. So,. yeah, the two years you cannot compare. I find that difficult. I think you always look back at a year, what can I do better? And I think you always try to be a more complete driver. But you're not a robot, you make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes. But it's all about trying to minimise that and just minimise risk as well in some situations. And yeah, sometimes that works a bit better than other times. But overall, I think throughout the whole season it's been working very well. Well, I mean, I still have a few more years in F1. So I hope that we can be competitive for a few more years. I want to win more races. And potentially, I want to, of course, try and win more titles. But of course, that's not going to change what I've already achieved. And that's something I'm really proud of. But I think with everyone within the team, and you know, everyone who is involved with us, they deserve even more than what we are showing at the moment. And yeah, as long they are, we can keep them all together. I think we are capable of even more great seasons. Yeah, exactly. Also, for me, like, during the race, I had no clue what they were going to decide with the points. So of course, the main target was to win the race. But yeah, once I crossed the line, I was like, ‘OK, that was an amazing race. Good points again, but not World Champion yet’. Then I did my interview after the race. And then suddenly, my mechanics started to cheer and I was like: ‘What's going on?’ And then I realised that Checo was second instead of Charles. But I still didn't know if it was full points, half points or whatever is 75%. I don't know how you do it. But then of course, you read through the rules. And Tom [Wood, FIA Media Delegate] came to me and he said that I was the world champion. So then we celebrated. And then suddenly people were telling me ‘no, you're still missing a point’. So, it was like: ‘Oh, that's amazing. That’s a bit weird.’ But then eventually we had enough points so then we were world champion again! Yeah, I mean, of course, probably people expect a little bit more of you. But at the end for me, that doesn't really change. It's just you always look at yourself and say, what can you do better, right? I don't think necessarily I became a faster driver, because I don't think at this stage of your career that you suddenly find a tenth or two-tenths in your driving. It’s all about learning from previous seasons and just trying to apply that. And probably that just sometimes, some situations can make you a little bit faster because you know, a little bit better what to do with whatever you know? Can be the car, can be the tyres, just track experience. But yeah, besides that, of course, we didn't have the fastest car over one lap for most of the season, I would say. Just – I don't know – it just didn't really suit our car, the one-lap pace. And being a little bit overweight, of course, in the beginning, quite a bit. That doesn't help over one lap performance. But I think these new cars, it's quite interesting, because before you really focus a lot on qualifying, because you knew that it was very hard to pass a car. Now even if your qualifying is not amazing, if you have a good race car, you can still fight and you can still actually pass people. So that's the beautiful side of the new cars. And that's why I think, let's say we had that problem last year where you have a problem in qualifying where you’re not as competitive. I think we wouldn't have won the amount of races as we did this year because, yeah, this year, pole was nice, but it doesn't always mean that you're going to win the race. It's always been quite a good track for me, I really, somehow enjoy going around there. It's very different, of course, very low grip and that feels a little bit more like a go-kart around there. We still have to, of course, wait and see how the new car is going to go around there. But so far, I've always had really positive memories from that track. And of course, it's also Checo’s home grand prix. But I think in general, Red Bull will have a lot of support there. But yeah, I know, top speed is important there. We have quite a bit of top speed this year. So that will help. But then again, it's all about little details, like trying to get your tyres to work well over one lap, trying to make sure that the tyres are holding on over a race distance there as well, which sometimes is actually quite difficult around there. So, still a lot of factors that can go wrong, but it's definitely a track I'm looking forward to. I think the first one is always the most emotional, but I think this one is definitely the better one, just in terms of performance. Yeah, very different emotions. You know, last year, all the way till the last race is probably the worst kind of feeling, going into that last race. But also because at the time, I don't think we were the quickest anymore, so that also doesn't help. And this year, I think, yeah, it's just been very, very different in emotions from the start, all the way through to the year. But you know, both are beautiful and both are, at the end of the day, nice to experience because it's nice also really have always the pressure on and having to perform to your limit every single lap of the race. But not for too many years in a row. So, I was very happy with the year we had this time around. Yeah, I already planned before coming here that I was going to fly back home. But I’ve got four race weekends at least to celebrate so yeah, I mean, of course I'm focused on the result always during a race weekend. But yeah, there is no real pressure anymore but I still want to of course try and win more races because with the car we have now you have to try and take advantage of that. Because you don't know if you're ever going to have that again, next year, in the years to come. So, we’ll definitely try to win a few more. Yeah, I mean, of course, at the time, you’re also just really upset with the situation, but just looking at how the whole season was going in terms of how close the cars were, yeah it's very surprising, of course, to have this much of a lead. But when you, of course, look at what happened during the races you can understand. So yeah, I'm, of course, in a way pleased that it was like that. But of course, in any other way you do like, of course, having a close battle. But hopefully we can have that then next year. To be honest, we were just very upset. But I think we also, we know that we have to fix it quickly. And to be honest, we were feeling alright. It was not like that we were down in the team. Everyone was like: ‘it's a long season, a lot of things can happen’. I say it's true. Absolutely. Just have to try and fix what is going wrong at the moment. And then, of course, anything is possible. But that's a good thing, I think, about the team: we don't act really disappointed, or you certainly get a very different feeling within the team. Everyone is of course upset, with what happened, but then we also tried to really quickly fix it and super motivated to try and turn it around. So yeah, it's maybe a day where you’re a bit upset or two days, but then you’re on calls, and talking to people: what can we do? what can we fix? And how do we move forward. And you get to the next race, and everyone is smiling again. And we all have the same goals. So that's the thing, the nice part of the team. You always stay quite neutral in success and disappointments. Because I think at the end of the day, that works best because, you have to just keep being focused. Of course, you know, now, it's amazing, winning all these races and winning the Championship. But then tomorrow, you wake up, like, ‘we still need to win a few more’. That's just the mentality within the team. Yeah, I mean, they love motorsport, they love Formula 1. And they really always dress up for the occasion. And yeah, it's really nice to be here. First of all, this is amazing track. I love coming to Japan in the first place. And also all the fans, they wait for you, all the evening, all the night, they probably even sleep in their cars to then see you in the morning again, so they are very dedicated.  And yeah, it's definitely very special always to come back here. That's why three years was definitely too long. Yeah, it's going to be a long season. I thought this one was already pretty long – but we’ll see. I think as a team, yeah, we're going to try and, of course, prepare for next year as good as we can. And then yeah, we'll try to, of course, get it as close as we can to this year, because replicating something like this will be very tough – but I have a lot of good hope within the people in the team that we can create again, a really good car. Well, it's just going to depend on the coming years, right? We have a really good group of people. And I think they also work really well together. So it's all about just, keeping them together. And so if we keep them together, I think they can achieve a lot. And then of course, if I have a competitive car, I'm confident that we can keep this going. But it also depends on what the competition is going to come up with. But yeah, I really believe in this group. And I really hope that in the coming years, we can enjoy a lot more wins, and potentially, of course, championships. To be honest, I don't mind that it was a little bit confusing, I find it actually quite funny. Because at the end of the day, it's not going to change, right? The result? I mean, when I crossed the line, it was anyway, not enough, even if you would give full points. So, in that scenario, you know, wouldn't have changed anything. About the rules? I honestly, I mean, these are really complex situations with the weather the amount of laps. And then, of course, there's a difference between if you finish the race or the race gets red flagged early on and then you can't continue. And there is of course, a difference between the two. So yeah, I do think that if you don't write enough rules, it's not good. If you write too many rules, also not good. It's always really hard to find a middle ground, I think.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was a little hectic as always with Charles, you know, good racing. We were fighting each other really hard. I tried to make a move at the end. I think he locked up and went off, which was fair race, Yeah, certainly a great result here for Honda, for all the Japanese fans that have been amazing. It's a great day for our team, you know, now that Max becomes champion, it's certainly a massive day for all of us. Yeah, it was certainly nice and we have to keep the momentum going until the end of the season. Yeah, it was a nice battle again. I think it was really tricky to overtake without DRS. I had to place it into 11 and out of 14 on the way to 17 on the back straight but those places were where Charles was actually strong. I could see that he was managing well his race, his tyres once he ran out of them. And he was making it really hard, you know, so I knew that the only way I could get him was if I push him into a mistake, and yeah, towards the end, I thought there was one more lap left so when he went off, I thought that was going to be the opportunity. But it didn't happen and we managed to get a good result for the team. And a great one-two. Well, I think Max has had an incredible season: a lot of respect for him. I've said it before: I don't feel like Red Bull have had a dominant car, to have won the championship the way Max won it, so I think he definitely pulled a gear or two compared to anyone else. I think in the beginning I was a lot closer to him; once he got quite comfortable with the car and I was more uncomfortable with it, he was driving at another level compared to everyone you know. The races that he did were sometimes incredible, incredible to watch so yeah, a lot of respect for him. Very happy for him and for my team. You know it's a massive achievement to have won the championship here. One-two for Honda as well so it's definitely a very special day for the whole team. In any conditions which should never see a crane on track while the cars are out there. You do not really know what can happen there. It doesn't matter (about) the conditions; it should just never happen and I really hope that this is the last time we get to see in any category the recovery vehicles on track while there are cars out there. I think the first time, when we were on laps to the grid, the track was looking alright, even for inters, but I think it picked up before the race start and especially, I think, during the first lap it picked up even more. So yeah, I think in that regard it was right to stop the race, to start the race at the times we did, but what is really low and was the lowest thing I've seen in years was two crane vehicles out there.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Well, from lap five onwards to be honest, it was all downhill, really struggling with the tyres. A bit like the last race, no. We are very strong warming up the tyres but then after three four laps we just destroy them. So yeah, a struggle this time. A huge congratulation of course to Max for his second World Championship. And yeah, we'll keep pushing until the end. It's obviously frustrating today. The pace was not quite there after four laps. But it's like this. Exactly. That's the goal. I mean, I think Max's title this year was just a matter of time, really. So we expected him to win the world title. Now we need to use those last races in order to become a better team and hopefully, yeah, put him a bit more of a challenge next year. Well, I don't have much to say. Yeah, I did a mistake, tried to minimise it obviously by trying to go straight… I was not aware this was the last lap but five seconds penalty was the right thing to do to be honest. Yeah, we were very fast for four or five laps but unfortunately the race was a bit longer than that and the front were just gone after four or five laps and after that it was all about trying to survive until the end of the race. The end of the race was extremely difficult. Obviously Checo was putting quite a bit of pressure behind and I was really, really struggling with both of my front tyres so yeah, at the end, I ended up making a mistake but we were really, struggling today. Yeah, it was fun. It was close. It didn't last too long. But yeah, it was nice. Of course, a huge congratulations to Max and to Red Bull. They've done an incredible job this year. Yeah, Max has just been incredible and it's a title fully deserved and on our side, we'll try to push for the last four races this season to improve as a team and to hopefully put more of a challenge next year. Yeah, we shouldn't see these type of things. Of course, something happened in 2014 and we all know that and I think we should all learn from it. So yeah, Max said it very well. Once you are first, it's actually quite OK but once you are behind you don't see anything. And whenever you try to have a bit more visibility, you can get surprised by having a crane in the middle of the track. So yeah, it shouldn’t happen and I really hope we learn from it and that these things we don't see them again. Then for the conditions, they changed quite a lot, actually, from the laps to the grid to the actual first lap. There was much more rain, much more standing water and the visibility especially was extremely poor. That changed pretty quickly. I think a big problem of these cars is just the visibility. So whatever we can do to try and improve the visibility and minimise the spray, especially behind the cars, this will be hugely beneficial because I believe that sometimes we can actually run for the conditions of the track but just because of the visibility, because it's so dangerous being behind and you don't see anything, that we end up not running at all. But yeah, we should try and find a solution, for some reason, to try and minimise the spray.",Japan,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"It was pretty incredible to drive here again, and especially in qualifying, when you're on low fuel these cars really come alive through the first sector. So yeah, of course very happy to be on pole, but also in general, just super happy to be back here. I lost a part, a part of the duct on my final lap, so probably that's why I couldn't really improve. But nevertheless, the first lap was good enough. Yeah, I was just, you know, driving quite slow and I wanted to accelerate but my tyres were quite cold. So then I had a big moment. And then of course, Lando was trying to pass me at the same time, so he had to avoid me a little bit, but luckily, nothing happened. Yeah, it will be interesting first of all to see the weather. I mean, some say it's going to be dry, some say it's going be raining at some point during the race, so we just need to see what happens with that. And I'm quite confident we have a good car so yeah, excited for tomorrow. Yeah, it was, I think a pretty good lap at the time. Of course, you know, there's normally always a bit of track evolution going on after every run. But at the time, I think it was a good lap. The balance of the car was quite good. So then, of course, it's really enjoyable to be pushing here, especially through that first sector. Yeah, it's all about just finding the right balance for that first sector. And, you know, once the car is hooked up there, you get a lot of confidence and you can really push it through this combination of corners, and it's definitely one of the best on the calendar. Yeah, we were all on our out lap. And yeah, we were all lining up to try and create a gap to everyone. And somehow he still wanted to get me into the chicane. But I was at the point of accelerating but I was on very cold tyres, so I had like a little moment and that's why you had to drive around me. But you know, if you're just a bit more respectful than everyone is anyway already lining up. I don't think anyone is trying to pass into that last chicane. So basically, by trying to pass me you create that kind of problem. I'm not thinking about it too much. Just taking it day-by-day. I think what was most important is that we would have a competitive car and clearly we had that today in Qualifying, and I hope of course it's going to be the same tomorrow in the race – because we do need a perfect race to be able to win it tomorrow. But at least it's a good start. Of course I knew this already… it was coming. But yeah, of course, this is incredible for him. He's been pushing hard for it for a long time and to finally get that opportunity is amazing for him. But also, I think after Monza, there was no real discussion any more, I think. Helmut is the guy, when he likes something he is daring enough to then put him in the car, right, whereas maybe other teams are a bit more careful. And, yeah, that's great news. We are good friends as well. We had a dinner the day after Monza and I told him, like, just give him [Dr Marko] a call. You never know what happens and it was also the right time to call him, so Helmut is still probably excited on a Monday from the race on a Sunday, so it worked out really well. And I'm very happy for him. Yeah, it was just in the beginning, especially, because our car was very heavily overweight so then you know that once you got really down on fuel, it's just extra painful, I would say. And I think yes, the improvements on the car definitely helped but I still think that our car normally is better in the race than over one lap and luckily with the new regulations even if your car is not - let's say - amazing on a Saturday it doesn't really matter because if you have a quick race car you can still pass on most tracks apart from - of course - a few street circuits but at least it's not all qualifying biased, which I think it's good for the sport as well. I always tend to feel like I want different things for qualifying and the race here, every year of being here, and same in the wet, that's another thing I want from the car, so maybe for me it's been a bit more difficult but I think at the end of the day, you have to find a bit of a middle way and that's, I think, what we agreed on Different things!",Japan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, well, it's a very tricky lap around here because whenever you are first in the first sector, then you lose out in the last sector. And I tried to find that balance in the last lap, but lost a little bit the tyres in the last sector and lost a little bit of time. So yeah, it's so close though with everyone, so that's nice, and we'll try to have a good race from there. I mean, we have a very limited amount of data going into the race so that's always a challenge but the feeling was good with a car, so yeah, let's wait and see about the conditions. It seems we will have a bit of rain somewhere in the race, so yeah, it should be a fun race. Yeah, it's always nice to be here and see so many people passionate about the sport and being so creative, so hopefully we can give a good show tomorrow. The car was good, I was struggling more with the tyres to put everything together, first and last sector especially. The more I was pushing in the first sector, the more I was going slow in the last sector, losing a little bit the tyres. So, it was a tricky one but overall the car felt good. It's incredible. Especially the first sector feels crazy. There's so much grip. And in Q3, once you go for that last lap, it really feels special. So yeah, it was a fun qualifying. Well, I really like the sensation of the street tracks I think it's really fun too. It's a bit of a different thing, but Silverstone I guess is pretty similar on the quali lap. Well, not much data to look at for tomorrow, apart from the few laps that we did this morning, race run in FP3. So yeah, going a little bit into the unknown but it looks like the conditions are also pretty unpredictable for tomorrow. We don't really know whether it’s going to rain or not. Or maybe both. So yeah, we’ll see. No, honestly, there was no big compromises done for tomorrow. Obviously the forecast is predicting a little bit of rain here and there.  We won't know whether it will happen or not but it was very tricky though, to actually have the car ready and in the right spot for qualifying after only FP3 but I think we did a good job on that so it didn't compromise us.",Japan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it was a very clean lap, a very good laugh all the way until the last corner that I picked up quite a bit of wheelspin, probably used to be too much credit from my rear tyres in that lap and yeah, it's a shame to be half a tenth again from pole you know. It's been so many qualis now with Max and Charles that we are all within half a tenth. And the last half a tenth tends to fall more to the other side. Hopefully, yeah, towards the end of the season this half a tenth falls a bit more to my side and I can get a pole position. Yeah, I think the weather tomorrow is going to play its part. The rain is going to arrive. We don't know if it's going to arrive at two o'clock, three or four, which is after the race. So yeah, I think there's plenty of things that could happen tomorrow. There's also a great opportunity starting in P3, you know. We managed to save also a set of softs in case we need it, so, yeah, I think we are in a good position to fight Max tomorrow. It was a good lap. Clean all the way until the last chicane. There, probably I overcooked a bit a tyre, going into that last chicane and it cost me quite a bit of lap time. But another half-a-tenth that we could have got there but yeah, a bit fed-up of being half-a-tenth off pole. I think it's been a few qualis now, consecutives in Zandvoort, also before the summer break where we are, all three, very tight with each other but somehow it tends to fall into Max or Charles’ hands instead of mine, which hopefully towards the end of the season I will end up getting one and get it out of the way. It was pretty close. I think we managed to hook up a good balance in FP3, which is a good sign. It means we understand the car and we know the baseline set up normally works well in every track now. It’s now a matter of who that last half-a-tenth falls in favour of, which today was in favour of Max. At other circuits, it’s in favour of us. But it's super tight, at least in quali. Here, there's not only track evolution, but a lot of driver evolution and I think especially, when we have a bit of margin in Q1 and Q2, when you really go for it in Q3, you really go down on lap times, like we did. And we went to find that those last two or three tenths from the car that were particularly exciting to find around this track, because you really put yourself on the limit and you put the car properly on the limit with a lot of G-force here. And it’s one of these trucks that gives you just a lot of pleasure to drive in that limit, and it’s the best thing in Q3. You know big compromises apart from obviously having quite a bit of a hectic FP3 to put the car in the right place for qualifying but once quality started, you think about the dry and how to make the car quicker in the dry. Tomorrow, the rain, we don't know if it's going to arrive at two, at three, at four but it looks like it will hit us but you don't know if the rain is going to arrive in the last stint, in the first stint or after the race, which then it's not worth taking any compromises. But yeah, the good thing is that we are both cars up there again, ready to put the pressure on Max and see what… when the rain comes and how we can get both of us ahead.",Japan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, it’s amazing. As soon as I landed at the airport there were lots of people, even around the hotels. I went to the grandstands this morning for a bit of filming with Netflix guys, and I think even that, I found there was a lot of people, even though they limited the tickets on Thursday. So far, it’s been great days, definitely the best days I’m having, for sure, definitely in Formula 1. Just looking forward for this weekend. Yeah, I drove a Formula 4, I think it was four years ago. I was driving here and last time in Suzuka I won here – so it’s good memories, definitely it’s a good way to be here at Suzuka. I was driving here in 2m06s – 2m07s, so it’s like 40s difference. So it's a lot of different. And even in the simulator I felt like a lot of things going on fast, much faster than when I used to drive. So, I really like Suzuka, like I said, I was driving here since from 2016. And I drove here more than 10,000 laps or whatever. So I’ve learned a lot of tricks – but at the same time, like I said, it's a lot different when I drive a Formula 1. So, I need a good build-up but still, I think one of the best tracks in my experience. Yes. Well, I think I have to learn lots of things still in, in the rest of five races, from Pierre, for example. And for sure the kind of mistakes I did in Singapore have to definitely reduce, and lots of things for example, penalties, whatever. Also those things is unnecessary. So those things definitely have to improve but at the same time, the pace, especially one lap, I'm quite happy and having good progress so far. So, I'll just keep like this momentum until the next year. And yeah, just for the race, I think just experience more. Definitely, I have to get good back into the normal rhythm or good rhythm, like I had the first half of the season. And I think this will be probably a good opportunity to back into the rhythm. Or, I have to. So yeah, but I think still learning, lots of things lots of things to learn but I seem to have quite good confidence to do that. So far, no. It’s definitely a cool thing and… yeah it's very cool. Currently I don't feel like getting pressure because it’s really hard imagine I'm driving here, because like I said, just four years ago I was one of the spectators watching these guys you know? And now I'm driving in front of them, Japanese fans so yeah, it’s just really hard to imagine but definitely is a cool thing. I didn't expect that to be honest: there's like huge pictures at the grandstand. It feels very supportive and gives me extra energy for that. Yeah, I think like the first time I watched probably was the one when Seb got P1 in the championship with Red Bull. I think I was watching at Turn 1 at the entry. I still remember like lots of Formula 1s just entered Turn 1 with lots of sparks. And I think that was first time I watched Formula 1 since 2007 when I used to not like much Formula 1 because it was too loud, the engine sounds, I was covering my ears. But when I watched probably when Seb got the championship, I got super impressed with Formula 1 and just how they are fast and then lots of things just really surprised me. Yes. What was the question after that? Yes. I forgot to be honest. I don't have much memories. I was in Suzuka when Kobayashi got P3? Probably not, unfortunately.",Japan,thursday,AlphaTauri
Fernando Alonso,"I won once! 2006… only one time… but I won in Fuji also. This place yeah, I think everyone loves Suzuka. The combination again of high-speed corners, a little bit of banking in the corners as well make the feeling really special. The fans are so passionate here. So, the whole weekend is a big thing. And yeah, looking forward with this year's cars to enjoy especially the high-speed. Ha! I've had this question before and I'm not sure I have that memory at the moment to spot one – but I'm sure during this weekend, things will get wild for sure at one point and I will try to put all in the garage like this, so you enjoy as well. No. It was different issues. We have been hit quite badly about reliability this year. We lost a lot of points. And unfortunately, now we are in this battle with McLaren, few points behind and yeah, hopefully we can have a normal five races now and finish on a high. But yeah, has been our weakest point this year. I think so. I think there's going to be some weekends that we can score a few more points than them. Some others, we will score less. I think Singapore was standing out because it was a big loss in points there. But I think it's going to be very, very tight until Abu Dhabi. I don’t know. It’s a difficult topic from our side, driver point of view. I think is not really relevant here and we rely on our teams to really control everything they do. But yeah, I guess we all expect from FIA to police as good as possible all these things because we want to race on a fair environment and things. But it is a very… I think it's a very difficult topic, because there is a lot of things that we need to make sure that they are controlled. The budget cap is one thing, but there are many teams with different structures, with different things, with their own circuit in their own factories. Things that we need to control a lot. So, it has to be really well done. Yeah, I mean, we are maybe not completely safe until the end of the year. So, it is possible that we may have to introduce a power unit but yeah, I don't think that there's going to be this weekend but… soon. Very high, to be honest. As I’ve said a few times, I have a lot of trust in Mohammed, the President, and his team. I think there are still a few things on the race weekends and consistency and other topics that we face, yeah, race after that we are improving, but they are willing to learn and to improve as well. So that's very positive, maybe compared to the past. And yeah, as I said, on other things, outside racing, off-track, I trust completely what they are doing and what will be the outcome next week, I think on this cost cap and how the sport is moving to the future. So I think I have no doubts on anything.",Japan,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"Nothing really! We were in Tokyo, me and my physio, so pretty quiet really, had some sushi, and watched a movie. Not too exciting. Yeah, it's always great being here. It's been a couple of years now. And, you know, it's certainly one of the best tracks that I know. So, looking forward to getting back out there in a Formula 1 car again. And yeah, hopefully we can have a strong weekend. Yeah, well, I mean, it was a good Saturday. Qualifying was decent, you know, started in sort of Intermediate conditions, and then dried up. And we had this shootout at the end of Q3 on slicks in this damp, mixed track, which was really, you know, fun. And we got a decent qualifying, but then in the race, it was another… you know, wild conditions, mixed conditions. And one of those races where I think everyone has an opportunity to score points and we didn't, so that's disappointing. I got a terrible start, lost a lot of positions and then damaged my front wing. So got the black and orange flag, had to go and change the front wing and kind of just was stuck there the rest of the race. It's tough, because we're struggling a bit to score points at the moment. So, even though there's not that many points between us teams down there, it's hard to go and get those points and beat the other team. So yeah, we’ll have a chance and I think we're going into some circuits that should be better for us. So, you know, nobody's given up on beating those. We've been P7 in the Constructors’ for most of the year. And that would be a great position to get, you know, coming from a couple of seasons where Haas had been the last team in the Constructors' Championship, be able to be really cool to jump a few positions. So that's what we'll try.",Japan,thursday,Haas
Nicholas Latifi,"I think just to experience the track for the first time really. I mean, I've obviously heard so many great things about the circuit from different drivers, I’ve watch the races here, obviously many years. But yeah, the previous two years, just not having the experience to come here. So, you know, on the calendar this year, both Singapore and Japan, the first time, the circuits that I was, let's say, with the exception of getting my home grand prix, the ones that I was most looking forward to. I walked the track this morning and it's a bit different to be there in person, than when you're watching it on TV. It’s much narrower in places, much more banking as well than I would have thought. So yeah, quite excited to drive tomorrow. If it's not a wash-out tomorrow! Yeah. I mean, when I went to the media pen afterwards, I had obviously not seen the incident. So ,it's difficult to comment on. I mean, at the end watching all the different on-boards, I think, if you're going off the rulebook, I mean, it's clear he came up alongside me, and I didn't leave him enough space. I think the things that were maybe not considered, which is as well, maybe one of the frustrations that I didn't have a chance to go to this stewards, because they didn't ever summon me, like normally happens when there's an incident between two drivers. I was taking the same line I was taking every single lap beforehand. And I did actually look into my mirrors, both ways. You see from the onboard that I glanced in both directions but the problem was, just because of the difference in lines, he was driving in the blind spot of the mirror the whole way down to the corner. So, in that sense, I mean, as drivers we all know, there's a massive blind spot in the car. And again, I did look, so if he's driving in a place where I can't see him, when I do make an effort to look, and I just then take my normal line, it's, yeah… obviously, he ended up being there. But if I can't see him, because he's driving in a place where he should expect I can't see him, especially on a street track in the wet… so yeah, it's tricky. I mean, if I would have got penalised anyways, in the end, after being able to at least give my side of the story, I know, doesn't really make much of a difference and I would have accepted that. But yeah, I guess just not being able to go to the stewards and give my side of the events and give different points that I think weren’t considered. That was probably a bit frustrating, especially when we just want… we're always talking about the consistency amongst decisions and penalties and whatnot. Yeah, I mean, to be honest, at this point, because, as I said last weekend, I’m still kind of just evaluating all the options. I'm obviously considering everything. But yeah, I just don't really have much to say at this point. So yeah, when I decide what I'm doing then I'll update everybody.",Japan,thursday,Williams
Sebastian Vettel,"Yes! Well, I’ve always loved the track. I think it stands out. It's my favourite track in the calendar. And the calendars have, you know, changed over so many years, and the tracks have disappeared… while they're there but they’re not on the calendar anymore… and we've added other tracks but, I don't know, from the very first time this has been a special place for me. I think just the layout of corner, the first sector. It's iconic, it's a figure eight track, the only one we have, plus then the atmosphere you know? The attention the sport gets when we come here is crazy. So yeah, lots of very nice memories. And I didn't think you know, the other races obviously, I'm know that it will be my will be my last time in other places too but here it does feel a bit different somehow. But I look forward to the sessions that we have, every single one of them, and the race on Sunday. I got a little horse this morning! Not a real horse. But yeah. I mean, they are very attentive, and they come up with very thoughtful gifts as well. Nice letters and nice messages. Their stories and especially, you know, this year, it’s only the beginning of the weekend but how they started maybe following the sport, following myself and yeah, they are probably as sad as I am to realise it's my last race here, but equally as happy that we've got this weekend ahead of us. Yeah, along the same lines, I think. We try to control our driving and I think we know when we are right, and when we are wrong, in terms of being fair, giving enough space. We've just listened to Nicholas and shit happens as well. But we try to obviously, you know, be fair most of the time. And I think that's the same for any governance of the sport. It’s to supply the fairness, or to ensure the fairness is there across the team, across the year, across the season, across the sport. The FIA is in charge of that, and we have to trust them of doing the job. And if you fail to comply with the rules, then then there should be consequences. I mean, it's a complicated or complex matter, probably and we're not the best judges to understand. But yeah, I think the art is to break it down, make it simple and make it clear, so we'll see what happens. Not much story, I was gifted it just before. So, yeah, I think I have the same headband at home because I bought it many years ago but never wore it, so it reminded me and I said okay, it's probably time to wear. I know it says Ichiban. You can ask Yuki what it means! YT: It’s number one. SV: Technically, it’s wrong, because I’m number five. So, maybe Yuki can help me doing the signs. YT: Last time I saw you I think you won in Suzuka, many, many years, you take the championship, so it’s right! I guess they're racing in Suzuka as well, so I don't know. Never say never. I mean, it is a great track for many, many reasons. And yeah, who knows what the future brings? I don't know. Obviously I love driving and I think around this track I always felt very alive and the passion feels very alive. So yeah, we will see what type of car maybe in the future will come up. Maybe one of the guys, in the future, who races here will feel a bit sick, I don't know. I don't wish them to feel so, but I wouldn't mind jumping back in for a race in Suzuka at any time. But yeah, obviously. We'll see what the future brings. At the moment, I have no plans. But I think there are some exciting races happening in Japan and I don't know, we'll see. About a one race career in the future? Yeah. If anybody's happy to sign up a driver for a single race. I'm sure those guys wouldn't be happy to step aside but it would be something I would seriously consider. Well, I think it has been a different vibe. Obviously, I made my debut in Indianapolis five years before that, but I think there's been a different vibe in Austin, right from the get go. And it's been really exciting because the whole city was happy to have the race and welcomed us. Obviously, the interest across the US has grown in the last couple of years. But I think Austin has always been exceptional. So probably more a question for Austin, how they handle it now with more requests or people. But I also feel that Austin isn't your typical America, if such a thing exists. So I think for us, it's been great to go there right from the start. And it's been a highlight of the season for many years now, for 10 years. Well, I think you have to have a level of trust. Otherwise, it puts, or it shakes up everything that exists in your world, when you talk about racing. For us, you know, we want to be treated fairly when we race others and be judged upon it. You have to trust that, you know, there are regulations in place that allow everybody to have the same chances to win. Now, of course, only one team, one driver can win at the time but if you start to doubt that I think… I don't know what will be next. But certainly I think with that comes a very high responsibility. First, you have to do your job. But second, obviously, everybody's watching and everybody expects you to do the best job possible. So, it should be at the highest level possible, which sometimes we've learned or seen we miss from a drivers point of view when it comes to decisions, the decision-making progress, There is a will to learn. Our sport is also complicated; it is not that straightforward. It's not black and white, many times. So it's probably not an easy position to be in. But there's many aspects to it. On the other hand, it's a big business and it has to be controlled and it has to be controlled by an independent body. So you can’t think of that body not being independent or, you know, falling for either side. So, I think it's a given that you have to trust the governing body.",Japan,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, very much. Looking forward to it. I mean, it's been off the calendar for a while, but it's an amazing venue, amazing track. And, of course, also amazing fans in general. You know, they're very crazy about Formula 1. So I think we're all very happy to be here. And of course, for us, it's extra special, you know, with Honda involved. Yeah, we're hoping for a good weekend. It would make it a little bit, you know, extra special because of our relationship with Honda. I think it was already a shame that we couldn't be here last year, you know, in a title fight. So that's why we're really looking forward to being back here. And then we'll see what happens. We need a perfect weekend, that's for sure. Yeah, they're very passionate; crazy, but in a good way. And they really dress up for it as well. I mean, you see quite a few people walking around with a DRS rear wing on their head, for example. It just shows you how popular motor sport I think is, in general, in Japan. I mean, I arrived in Tokyo and I turned on the TV and the first thing that popped up was just racing again, a different category, but yeah. Great culture. And that's why I think we all love coming here. Yeah, it's great to see the full name back on the car. HRC was already on the car so Honda never really left. And of course it makes it extra special that they are back on the car, just before their home Grand Prix. And yeah, we've been working really well together. It's been really enjoyable. In terms of working relationship compared to last year, not a lot has changed anyway, so yeah, just very happy that the name is back, more prominent, and about the future, it's too early to talk about that right now but I think in general, the Honda name for F1 is great and it would be very nice to see them come back again. I remember I was literally on fire at the end of the session, so that was good! Yeah, it was nice. To do your first outing in an F1 car around Suzuka is probably not normally straightforward, but Red Bull wanted me to do it, and yeah, I remember the very first time I drove out, I couldn't believe how much power I had. So that was a bit of a shock to the system, but overall, very good memories of driving the car and trying to just understand the basics of a Formula 1 car and then of course, in all those years after that… to be honest, I think what helped the most is just experience and good moments, bad moments you've had in Formula 1. I think they make you a better driver, just knowing how a weekend works, knowing how to deal with Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Now, it all feels very easy. Of course, when you just start in Formula 1 it's all very unknown and at the time, I only had one year of single seater experience as well so all of that. Yeah, if I compare myself as a driver now to then it's a very big difference. It's not rocket science. I mean just pay attention to the fuel level. So there is not much to really change. When you fuel the car for five laps, you can do five laps, you're not going to be able to do six laps. You can talk about it for hours but it's not going to suddenly change anything. But it's not only that. We had a very poor Friday in terms of amount of laps so also there, I think a few things went wrong because when we made changes to the car we couldn't really test of course, because it was wet. Carried that on into the race. So yeah, just very messy weekend and I think that was just a prime example of how you don't want a weekend to go. So you learn from that. But there's nothing like it suddenly needs to change in the team. We all know that it was a bad weekend but we also have shown this year that we've had a lot of very good weekends, so we know how to do it. Yeah, that's right, it's not a surprise. You know, they tell me. It's not like… I know what's going to happen. I mean, it's just great to have the name back on the car. Who knows what is going to happen in the future? I don't know. I'm also probably not the right person to speak about potential things that can happen in the future, right, but it's nice to have the full name back on the car. It would be very nice if it happens here but if it doesn't happen here, I will be even more in favour the next race. So it doesn't really change anything, you just want to have a good weekend and try to maximise everything you can. And of course, I need a perfect weekend to be able to clinch the title here. But to be honest, I'm not really thinking about it too much. To be honest, I'm not really busy with these kinds of things. I mean, it's up to the teams and with the FIA, and I just have to focus on the driving. So not much more to say on that. I guess we'll find out on Monday.",Japan,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"He’s always got a smile on his face! Yeah, I mean, it was very exciting coming here in 2019. As the guys just touched on, the fans are obviously so enthusiastic, and it’s always a pleasure to come here. But obviously, the circuit itself is one of the greats and that is always, you know, a real joy to drive around the circuit. I think all of it, to be honest. I think obviously, the first sector with the ‘Esses’ and that flow of corners. It is truly iconic. And it's definitely, you know, a top-five circuit for probably all of us. So it's going to be, you know, a fun Saturday I think in qualifying. We'll see what the weather's like on Sunday. Obviously, it was a unique race when we were here in 2019 because we had the typhoon on Saturday. So let's see if we have a bit more of a normal weekend. Yeah, definitely difficult. I think it was never going to be straightforward starting from the back in those conditions. You know, we made some bold decisions. Obviously, everything's easy in hindsight, and perhaps a little bit too risky, all in all. But yeah, we knew it wasn't going to be straightforward. And that's what happens when you have a bad qualifying on a circuit like that. To be honest, not really, it’s sort of in line with what we expected. I think these races, especially post-summer break, we're getting a really clear trend of where our car is working well and where it's not working and it’s given us a really sort of clear development direction to go down. So I think it is a shame for us as a team to have not capitalised on that race weekend. I think we all felt that. But for sure, there's still a lot of positive signs to take away, especially that we really struggled on three circuits at the start of the year, and arguably that's probably the fastest race weekend we had last week. I mean, I'd love for it to be as competitive as it was last weekend, but I think it's going to be a little bit more of a struggle. I think Ferrari have been very fast in the medium, high-speed corners this year. The Red Bulls have been really slippery down the straights, which obviously, with only the one DRS zone here, they'll probably be in a good place as well. So it's not going to be straightforward, but I think we always show quite good pace on a Sunday. So there's no reason why we can't be in the fight. Firstly, similar to what Max said: it's not my sort of duty to dive into those details and I'll just sit and wait and see what the results are on Monday but I just know from our experience within Mercedes, how hard the whole team has worked to stay within that cost cap. We know we can bring more performance to the table if we had more money to spend and it's as simple as that. And yeah, I trust in Mohammed and the FIA to bring in an appropriate punishment for anyone who's found guilty of the charges accused and it should be quite straightforward. And you'd expect the amount that's gone over should be the amount that's taken off for next year's budget and probably a bit more on top of that as a punishment. Yeah, let’s wait and see.",Japan,thursday,Mercedes
Daniel Ricciardo,"Ha! Yes. It's a big one. It's really, really cool to be back here. Yeah, already, as Max touched on like, it's Thursday, but the fans are already here in full force with all the, I don't know, would you call it apparel? It's more like costumes and stuff. But there's like a full size, full life Sebastian Vettel race suit helmet, already ready to go in the paddock earlier, so it's fun. I mean, it's big. I feel like every driver has their loyal followers here. You know, I remember since my first time in 2011, I think, I still, like, recognise the fans from back then. And some photos as well, you know, they make T-shirts of you. It's fun. So yeah, everyone's got a little fan club here. Relieved. Happy. Pleased. What's word association? I was just, it was certainly like, you know… It's not… [laughs at something off mic] Yes, very good. Very good. It's one of those ones where it was like, I was very obviously happy. It was honestly a bit sad that I haven't had a top five this year. So it was good to get that. But it was also like the sad reality of ‘ oh wow, it's been quite a tough year’. But of course, you know, just to get back to the team after as well and obviously Lando had had a great race. So for both of us to be top five, it was just like a wholesome environment that we'd certainly missed on those Sunday nights. We hadn't had many of those. Yeah, I mean, it's the sport, how it can turn around just as quickly in a couple hours on a Sunday. And, you know, it's obviously put us back into the fight, which obviously is good. It felt like it was starting to slowly get away from us. But a big weekend has got us right back there. So happy and try to take it down to the wire. No, it's all good. In terms of… I'm not in terms of keen on resolving it, it's more just… it's not… I wouldn't say it's like that, like there's not a problem. It's more just taking the time to figure out ultimately, what's the best thing going to be for me next year. So yeah, there's not like a rush or I don't feel like pressure or anything like that to go and quickly sign something and be done with it. It is something that I definitely want to take the right amount of time with and figure it out because it's not as simple as just… as I said the first contract that comes in front of me, sign it, and yeah, I'm back on the grid. So yeah, from a rush, I'm not rushed about making a decision. I think it's going to probably the more that we kind of just keep going with the rest of the season, the more it will become clearer, I think, what's going to be best for me. Yeah, I think I answered it. I don't know. But there's nothing that’s - let's say you guys don't know, in terms of that. Like there's nothing that I'm not telling you. I think there'll be full transparency from that point of view and I think when I know what I'm doing, then everyone will know, they'll hear it. I mean, the good results help. They help, they make everything better, in terms of an enjoyment. It's always more fun racing at the front of the grid. But it's not… I don't think it's necessarily a question of if I still want to do it. I still do want to do it. I think that is how - do I say - like, unconditional for now, like in terms of where I'm at. But it's just the right circumstances, I guess. So yeah, the result felt good. I don't think it changes my course for the next 12 months or whatever it's going to be but yeah, it's cool. I think that's why I mean, I want to be up the front. Yeah, I think the significance with Austin is I was born there. It's always been like very close to my heart, you know, your birth places. It's pretty real, you know, it never leaves you. Anyone from Perth listening is going to really not like me for that comment. But no, it's just been fun like from going there from the start, I was so – what's the word I'm looking for, like a big word – filled with joy when it got renewed and extended. I think they announced that last year, wasn't it? But it's just the growth of the sport in the States. Obviously, it's really cool and I enjoy that I. I think America do sports better than anyone, the way they build an event around the sport itself is really cool. So I think for us, as F1, to have like an ever-growing presence there is really cool, but just going back to Austin, anyone that's been knows it's just a fun place. It's one where you're out all the time and enjoying it and it's just a very fun week. I have no idea if I answered your question, but thumbs up for Austin. I'm still trying to figure out if I answered the last question. Bathurst? I follow it in terms of I'll definitely watch, I'll watch highlights and try to track a little bit who's looking quick and stuff like that. But yeah, I'm not sure who's looking good, who's going to be the favourite, necessarily, this weekend but it is a cool race. My folks are actually going out, so they will be there. I think it's their first time, so I'm keen to speak to them over the course of the weekend and hear how the experience is going. But it is really cool. As a kid, watching it, you'd put the whole day aside and watch the Bathurst 1000 and it was always an event, so fond memories of that race. And hopefully it's a good one this year.",Japan,thursday,McLaren
Zhou Guanyu,"I think everything. Firstly, of course, the food is great and I always like to be here. And then, I think the fans is always a special one. And yeah, this track has a lot of high-speed corners. So, my favourite track is of course Silverstone, so maybe it's a little bit similar layout, who knows? We'll be trying that tomorrow. But overall, yeah, really looking forward to being here. I think it will be my first time, you know, visiting Suzuka circuit. Yeah, we're going to have the new front wing for both cars, so it's nice to have that and especially I think for here it’s very important, because let's say during the second half the season after break, we haven't been running too much upgrades compared to our main rivals in the midfield battle. So I think we lost a little bit of speed in terms of that and performance, so it's great to have that and hopefully they are working as expected so should pass much stronger and in this battle because I think yeah, Singapore is a good race. We were able to carry quite a bit of momentum while we left on in Monza to be competitive but unfortunately when the race was turning out to be damp conditions it kind of put us back and especially for my race was very compromised with lap one and also what happened during the race. Yeah, for sure, last season for me while I was doing the F2 championship I was waiting for the confirmation quite late and that's definitely a lot of pressure so this season looking to get it all done, all signed for my future, to have a clear [view of] what's coming next and it's great because from my side it just gets rid of a lot of pressure on my shoulders. There's one thing less to think of in the remaining races so from my side it’s more like just to be looking at the race by race, trying to bring the team into the points and for next season of course the object, the target will be higher and also for my side always asking more and more and I want to do better. So nothing has been really decided yet what I want to do and what’s my achieved goal but I think just be keep working. This year has been, from my side, it's been a great season so far. Of course, I had quite a lot of different moments. There's ups and downs and tough moments, but overall, I think I’m happy just to be able to show what I am capable of so it's good to have that.",Japan,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Charles Leclerc,"I don't know. Personally – and I think all the drivers – we love the first sector. It's such an incredible challenge, such a high speed section and also corner after corner. If you miss one, then you miss the whole section. That's what makes it so exciting to me, driving-wise. Then obviously there are the fans too that are so passionate and they always come up with very creative ideas and it's always it's always a good moment to be here. We've got a very different car this year, a car that is much more solid on every track. Red Bull will be very strong here. It's a track where you run the car in a similar position to Spa, and I expect them to be very, very strong. So hopefully we learned well in Spa and we will be stronger than we were there. I think we've been pretty strong with starts all year long. Looking back at Singapore, I don't think we did anything bad. Looking back at the start, I think myself, Lewis and Fernando all had a bad start going down on the patch on the right hand side and that was a little bit unfortunate. So I'm confident that the starts will be fine this weekend. You just need to remember to stay on the brakes until the lights are out, otherwise you roll and it’s a stupid penalty but apart from that it doesn't change much. Well, as I've said, before Singapore, I think we need to use these last races… as you said, I think realistically Max is going to be a champion, if it's not this weekend it’s going to be very, very soon. But we need to focus on ourselves, try to execute well the Sunday because the performance is not what we lacked this year. If we look from the first race to now, we've always been strong and the performance was always good enough to actually fight for wins apart from some offs, but there aren't many. I think it's mostly about trying to put everything together coming the Sunday: strategy, tyre management and yeah, that's where we are focusing on at the moment. And this is the step that we'll have to do next year in order to fight for the championship. Yeah, same. Speaking about ourselves, of course if we have more to spend you will go faster on track so if there's any team found guilty in that they should be punished. Then what's the punishment? No, I'm not the one to decide. But for sure, it should be punished.",Japan,thursday,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, very tough out there and never really got into a rhythm in the wet and then, yeah, couldn’t challenge the top two guys because I was always struggling a bit more with the rear, with the car. So, in the end, in these conditions, when you don’t have that extra bit of confidence I had to settle a bit for P3. The good thing is I didn't’ do any mistakes, I could bring the car home and I could be quick towards the end of the race when I managed to build a bit of confidence – but yeah, good result for the team for the Constructors’ Championship. A shame that we couldn’t get the win. Yeah, it’s crazy how long it takes here to dry. I don’t know but we keep doing laps, and you keep looking at the track and the dry line never appears in some places, and it keeps sliding a lot. But it’s definitely something to keep in mind for the future because this track is pretty unique on that. Yeah, it was unfortunately quite lonely for me because I just didn't have the pace. Today on the intermediate tyre, I lost a lot on the road to Charles and Checo. I couldn't keep up with him. I was struggling quite a lot on these tyres. I think I lost quite a bit the front and I was having a lot of moments, a lot of front locks, and every moment here costs you confidence and costs you the ability to recover that pace. Yeah, at one point I had to settle a bit and recover that confidence because I couldn't keep up and once the confidence recovered in the slick and towards the last 10-15 laps. I managed to be quick but it was just way too late. It was a good start. I think as good as it gets in the wet to be honest because I felt like me and Checo pulled away together and yeah, I could get Lewis and then he obviously tried to get me around the outside, but you're not going to get me around the outside so easily, no, because it's a bit my corner at that point and glad that we didn't have any issues on the car or at least it didn't feel like it and we could keep the position and then it was all about managing the gap to him because it was clear for me that in order to catch the guys in front I had to take too many risks. Yes, yes, it’s good news to see that the race was well executed on both sides. There still things I'm convinced that we need to keep improving and do better. But the team is taking massive steps forward. And we're learning from every situation. And as Charles said, you know, these last five races, or these last six counting with this one, they are going to be great preparation for us in order to be better at the front next year, because it's clear that the car is there, the drivers we’re there, we just need to keep improving the execution and whenever we have the opportunities, nail them. No, no especially on the wet, I don't feel like the track is physical at all, it's usually warm in the car but this is not a problem because the physicality of it is much lower, it was just a matter of pure, pure pace and confidence. I think here confidence is key and when you have a couple of moments, it snowballs and then you have to take a bit more margin and then you start losing extra pace compared to other tracks because  next time around, you might be in the wall and you might look like an idiot, no? So it's a confidence thing that I will work on, I will have a good look with my engineers to see what I could have done better,  what we can do in these sort of conditions because as you said, is my one of my strongest points as a driver. And I think it's going to be only a one off. No, I think I cannot be happy because I wish I could have put some pressure together with Charles and Checo and we could have been both up there to play a bit with Checo but today I simply didn't have the pace and it's something that I need to look at. That's why I'm not happy at all, because it's normally the conditions where I normally am quite quick and normally execute good races. At some point I had to settle a bit because it was not worth taking any risks because I was P3 with ten seconds behind and ten seconds in front and at that point you have to bring also the P3 for the team, no, instead of pushing a bit too much and making a mistake. So yeah, something to look at but of course I am not happy and I will look at this race with good analysis and come back stronger in Suzuka.",Singapore,post-race,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I pushed all the way. I mean, the bad start put us on the back foot and after that it was a really difficult race after that. I had a little bit of wheelspin and lost the performance there. Difficult! Difficult – now a good night’s sleep and we'll get ready for Japan. No, no, every race has a different feeling. But the frustration is there, obviously. I mean, the pace was really good today. Unfortunately, we had a bad start and from that moment onwards we were a little bit on the backfoot. I tried to put quite a lot of pressure on Checo. But yeah, you overheat the tyres pretty quickly, and then you drop a little bit. So it was very difficult to stay always on the gearbox of Checo. But the performance was there. I also think that the choices we've made today were the right ones. And as I've said before this weekend, no, I want to use these last few races for us to get better on the execution of the race, especially, and I feel like it's a step forward this weekend. We need to do other steps forward. But it's a good step in the right direction. And on that I'm happy. But of course frustrated with the second place today. Well, I don't really know yet, whether it's me who did mistake in the way I do things or if it's something else, we'll have to analyse it. The only thing I felt is that I had a little bit a bit of wheelspin, and lost it and I saw Checo had an amazing start. So yeah, that's the way it went. But it's like this. At the beginning, yes, but I pushed quite a lot. And then in the last 10 laps, I think he started to pull away again. But overall, I think the performance was also good on the inters, it’s just that obviously it was not super wet, so the tyre temperatures will go pretty high and then I will lose quite a bit of grip whenever I was behind him. But then after Safety Car, we will always be pretty strong. But I think there's also things that we can analyse from this race because Red Bull seems to be very, very good after six, seven laps. We are very, very good in the first six, seven laps. And we'll look into that. I was quite surprised because as soon as I lost the DRS I think it was exactly at the time when Checo’s tyres started to work properly and unfortunately then I lost it a little bit. But yeah, before that everything was really on the limit, with the dirty air in conditions like this the slightest mistake you pay big time. So I did few mistakes, I was just trying to be as close as possible because I basically had to make the overtaking on the straight. I couldn't really go on the braking zone and brake later because I didn't really know how was the track on the inside and I didn't want to take that risk. I had one lap where I was really close and I actually thought about going in the inside and braking later but for me, it was not worth it so I was just waiting for the right opportunity. That unfortunately didn't arrive at the end. No, you push until the end. I knew that obviously Checo was under investigation,  my engineer had told me that so I was pushing and then as soon as he told me okay, Checo is 5.1 seconds in front then it was just all about bringing the car to the end. The conditions were really, really tricky and as Carlos said, it's just very, very tricky to drive the car and as Checo said also, mistakes can be very easy to do. So as soon as I knew that the five seconds gap was done, I just brought the car home. Well I wasn't close enough unfortunately, whenever he had those lookups. I don't think it was especially down to how ready were his tyres. I think he did few mistakes at the beginning, which is again, normal in those conditions but yeah, I wasn't close enough to actually attempt an overtake unfortunately. Again, I think track position in Singapore is really, really important and to be honest, I felt like we had a really good pace today. But having said that, it's our responsibility to do a good start and today Red Bull have been better than us on that. But I don't think it's a tendency for us though. I think Carlos did a great start today so we'll look on my side and try to make it better.",Singapore,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was certainly, I think, my best. My best performance. I controlled the race, although the warm-up was very difficult. The last few laps was so intense. I really… I didn’t feel it that much in the car but when I got out of it, I felt it. You know, I pushed. I gave everything for the win today. No, I have no idea what’s going on. They just told me I was under investigation, so increase the gap, and it’s what we did. Yeah. I think it’s nicer for Max to get it in Japan, and for the team. Would be very special for Honda. So, yeah, all in all a fantastic day. It felt great. It was such a good start, first of all, which really, was great, you know, to really do the first… I basically felt that I had the race on the first section, on the Inters, under control. I could really do what Charles was doing, and open-up the gap. If was important to make sure we had good tyre life. I honestly was expecting the track to dry-up earlier than it did. I think if George wasn't out there, there will be a lot more people going earlier. But at the same time, I mean, it was such a tricky race. I think the keys to the race today was to control the pace on the Inter, have good pace when we need it, and the second one was to survive on the slicks in the beginning, because we were with extremely poor conditions. I think sometimes people, when they’re looking at you, underestimate how hard it is, and how easy it is for us to make a mistake. We basically were going to few places where it was properly damp, properly wet and it was super, super tricky, to make a mistake. I had a lot of moments, so first of all, I'm really happy I finished the race. But secondly, to win this race. It's super special. I think how intense it was, you know? To keep Charles behind, especially after the restart, when the warm-up was super hard and we were going basically… half the track was on the dry side but the other half was good enough for Inters – and we were on the slick. So not to make a mistake, and control Charles, who was really strong in the early phases. But then, I think the pace I had in the last few laps was really strong because to basically be able to have that was really, really strong. Well, I think basically… I'm pretty confident there's nothing with it, because there was a bit of miscommunication with Bernd. On the places where I could keep up with him, he was super slow; on the places where I could not keep up with him, he was fast. So it was a bit of miscommunication there. But yeah, I think these conditions are not normal. So, it's fully understandable that the conditions that we were in, that we were facing, especially final sector, were super tricky. So yeah, I do expect now, no further action in that as the stewards were pleased with my explanation and they understood it. Yeah, I'm super happy. This win is really special for me, because I've had a bit of a rough patch in the last few races. And I mean, obviously, the media in Formula 1 makes it extremely, a lot bigger, maybe because I'm just Mexican and if I'm not two races in a row in the podium, then I'm having a worst season ever and Red Bull should drop me and all that sort of stuff that you get to see. And yeah, it’s just nice to get that win and yeah, it’s not a reminder to anyone of how good I am. But it's just always good to be able to put together this sort of performances. And yeah, just keep going, you know, we kept working really hard. Yeah, I think it’s just what I said before, you know, when you’ve just lost all your temperature behind the Safety Car, and you're going with a slick tyre through a wet patch it’s really difficult, you know. You are just a passenger. And people really don't understand how hard it was for us out there today in those conditions. We did struggle a bit with driveability, so it's something we have to work on. There were a few occasions where the engine was doing something we were not expecting. So yeah, a few things to understand from there.",Singapore,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"I didn't hear the end. But yeah, definitely an amazing crowd. And it's great to see so many people attending the event. It's been a very, very tricky qualifying – Q1, Q2 with the inters, then in Q3, we didn't really know what to do. We went for the soft at the very last minute. And it paid off. I mean, it was really, really tricky. I did a mistake on my last lap, so I thought we wouldn't get pole, but it was just an off. So really, really happy. Yeah, I'm very happy with today's result, especially considering the Friday that we've had. We had a very limited amount of laps yesterday, for some issues, but we recovered well. We don't have much data for the race run. But, yeah, if we do the perfect execution, I'm sure we can win. It was really, really special. I mean, every qualifying on street tracks are super on the limit. And even more when it's damp like that, there are some parts of the track that are wet, so you lose the rear. But overall I managed to do quite a clean lap. And it worked well. No, this one, for the conditions, especially, obviously, Q1 and Q2 with the intermediates and we were really quick. And then you restart a bit everything from zero in Q3 when you finally go on slicks. But it was very, very tricky out there. So yeah, this one was more difficult. No, it wasn't. There was the last sector that was quite tricky, because there were quite a lot of damp parts. Also, Turn 13 was quite tricky. So it was not the same everywhere. So you had to adapt and also go with the track improvements. But yeah, my… Not my last lap, but the one just before was really good and was the lap for pole. And my last lap, unfortunately I did a mistake. It wouldn't have changed anything. But maybe if Max had finished the lap, we probably would have lost pole for this mistake. But overall, it's been a positive Saturday. Yeah, we were discussing it and then in the very last moment I saw that everybody basically was going out on softs, so I had a doubt and I went back to my original choice, which was to start with the soft. Overall, I think the feeling with the car has been great all weekend long. So yes, we are missing a little bit of data for the race tomorrow but that doesn't concern me too much. We just need to try and do everything perfect. And I'm pretty sure the result will be there. Well, strategy’s going to be very important. I think we are in a bit of a different situation compared to 2019 with the strategy, but it should make it more exciting – but undercut will definitely be a thing tomorrow. I think when you get married it’s on the left? No, no, nothing to do with this. No, no, I wasn't. I always take them off and put them on again once it’s done. Yeah, I think the second last lap - is that the way you call it? Yeah - was good, especially for the track conditions at that time. It was all about building up for that last lap. Unfortunately, in the last lap, I locked up in…  I did a first mistake in turn 13, which cost me quite a bit of time, in turn 16, I went straight. And that was it, basically. But yeah, apart from that, I think we've been very competitive the whole qualifying session, which is great to see, especially in conditions like this. And again, the car feels good so it's been a positive qualifying session. Just a shame. I couldn't put everything together on the last lap. Well, obviously I was frustrated that day, I remember it very, very well. Looking back it was probably the right choice for the team because it helped us to do a one-two which probably wouldn't have been possible without that. Having said that, if it happens again tomorrow I will probably be as frustrated as 2019 because I'm here to win and the only thing I want to do is to win tomorrow so I'll try my best and let's see what we'll do. No, I'm not. I think our performances have been very, very strong. Also in the rain, in FP3 and in Q1, Q2. So I think in terms of performance, we are good. As I was saying, before coming to this weekend, our focus for the last part of the race is to improve on the Sunday execution so we'll put all our effort to have a two hour clean Sunday and if we do then I'm pretty sure the performance will be there. Not really. Not really. It is important for me to win as many races as possible until the end of the season, then, yeah, again, realistically, I think it's a matter of time before Max gets his title. So yeah, we'll just focus on ourselves, try to use these last races in the best way possible, maximise our package. This is important to me. The rest is… I don't care.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"To that start. I think there’s a good opportunity tomorrow already from the start to attack Charles and go for the win. It's quite disappointing to miss out on pole by two hundredths. But at the end of the day this is a great team result. My team did a fantastic job – the right calls out there and yeah, pretty happy and a solid job. Yeah, I mean, it was so tricky to learn the conditions today, and tomorrow, again, it can be wet at any time. So it will be so important and crucial not to make any mistake and just progress with the race. That will be critical for us. Yeah, I think once… in such a long lap once you are two hundredths away from pole, you definitely lost in a few areas, but conditions were super tricky today. Yeah, I had a big moment into Turn 13. We've been struggling a lot with the driveability and I had a massive moment under braking, which I'm happy just to complete the lap because I lost quite a bit of lap time. But at the same time, I could have lost more. So yeah, it's a bit disappointing to be so close to pole. But on the other hand, it's a good result and I think we are in a good position to fight from there. Yeah, well, basically, we're going blind tomorrow. We don't have much information on the long run. So yeah, it will be interesting. I think it's a place where deg seems to be really high and obviously the conditions – we are expecting a bit of rain just before the race, so there are still a lot of unknowns. But yeah, certainly we don't have much information so we will find out tomorrow. Yeah, certainly it's nice to be back on the pace. It's been a bit of a struggle, the last few races. So I'm pleased. Especially after the day we had yesterday, where it looked like another poor start with no information, so we basically had a really poor Friday. So yeah, I'm pleased that that we're back to where we belong. Yeah, I think the deg will be high, so there will be a point as soon as there is a window, I believe people will start to pit. It's never nice to be so close to pole because it always brings you back to your lap and especially in such a long lap, you know that you could have done better here or there. But I guess it's the same for everyone. With these tricky conditions, I think we all put in a tremendous effort to put the laps with it and, yeah, at the end of the day, Charles did a better job than us today and his team, and I think starting P2 we still can fight for the race.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, firstly, hi everyone in Singapore. I was pushing so hard, it was so, so close. I was trying so hard. These guys are always so quick. But I really thought maybe just with a perfect lap, it was really hard to get that, we could be fighting for first place. But I just didn't have the grip on the last lap. But nonetheless, I'm grateful to be on a second row and I'm grateful to the team for continuing to push and you know, we just keep our heads down and hopefully tomorrow will be a better day. Yeah, we didn't know how close we would be this weekend. We knew that the car would be stronger than it was in Monza. But we didn't know how close it would be but yeah, to lose out by that bit, yeah, it's okay. We just get up and fight again tomorrow. This is the highest I've qualified? I didn’t realise! Oh, it was incredibly close. And a really exciting session in general. The car felt a lot better today. We did a lot of great work overnight, back at the factory, but also here and a really clean qualifying session. And obviously, competing for front row constantly. So, I think at the end, it was so difficult to get that lap perfect. And I was hoping for some sort of lap like 2018 but the car definitely doesn't want to drive like that one, so you know, I gave it everything. And to be so close between a top three, I think is still great. So, let's hope we can do something in the race tomorrow. It's very hard to overtake here, but maybe we can have a better strategy than these guys. Well, everyone had a wet session in P3, so I couldn't say that I had confidence. After P2, it looked like we were half-a-second behind these guys. And the car didn't feel good in P3, quite a big gap to these guys and all of a sudden, in those damp conditions we were right with them. So that was a bit of a surprise. And in that moment, I was like ‘okay, it's on’. Maybe this is our moment, maybe finally we have a chance to fight for the front row, fight for pole. So, I was giving it my all but I think for all of us, just very tricky conditions. For them, it was Turn 13; for me it was Turn 16, was a bit of a handful, lost a bit of time there, but I still have to be grateful to be on the front row (sic). And yeah, we'll see what we can do from here. It feels incredibly rewarding, I think, for everyone in the team. We've really started with a real handful, difficult deck of cards that we've created for ourselves and reshuffling, and lots and lots of work. Everyone staying really positive, or as positive as possible and everyone just being incredibly diligent and never giving up. So, it's been an inspiring year for me, witnessing what my team do and being a part of that and yeah, I so badly want to… naturally the will and desire to get a good result for them, to pay them back for all their great work is part of it. Also, my fans have been the most incredible this year, on and off track. And we couldn't have survived the year without them. So, I also want it for them. But I think we've got a great turnout here this weekend. And I hope that tomorrow we can give them a good show. Same. Did you get married? I was not trying to make a statement. No. Basically we had this… obviously, I've had this… my jewellery and my nose stud for years. And obviously, we had that whole commotion at the beginning of the year. At the time it was, like soldered in. So it didn't come lose. They gave me at the time, for many races, they gave me, not therapeutic use, but like an exemption, until I could find a solution. And then went and got it taken out and tried to find solution, put it in and put it out. It got infected because of that. And I was just continuing on with this infection. And I had a blood blister and I was going on about it. So just had quite a sore on my nose. Then I went back and saw the… this is all stuff I've told them before qualifying. And then went back and had to have the… disgustingly, but the blood blister fixed because there was like pus and blood and stuff. And then put this in and the last two weeks it’s started to heal and they've asked that I keep it in. So it's crazy that we're obviously having to talk about something so small. I take everything else out. And yeah, at this point, I don't really care to be honest. I'm not really giving it much attention, to be honest. It's all whispers at the moment, I don't know enough about it to be able to make a sensible comment. I'm not thinking particularly anything. I'm proud of my team for the diligence that they've done to run to the rules. And I honestly, I have full confidence in Mohammed in the way that he's conducted himself to this point and in terms of being strict and being clear with the rules. The rules are rules and for those sort of things, which can lead to real alterations in terms of car performance, those sorts of things, we definitely have to take it seriously. But as I said, I don't know if it's true or not so we'll see. I can't speak for George. I don't know what happened with him in the session but again, I don't know why, the car was we're just working. You arrive one weekend and it doesn't work, you have no idea why and then other weekends it does and then one session it works and it just depends what mood the car’s in, I guess. But today, it was good that we're able to get temperature in the tyres and that enabled us to have the confidence to push and fight with these guys. So it was definitely tricky, though. Definitely wasn't anywhere near easy to keep up with their sort of pace. They're always so quick, these guys. I really don't know. I really don't know, man. And I've got a letter from my doctor. I've tried my best and I was just saying to Charles, you know, we've got the… One of the excuses I was given a long time ago was about heat and if you're in a fire and it's metal that conducts heat, but our suit is covered in… You know, we've got… Our belts, our zip is metal, our buckle around, our helmet is metal, we've got the wires that we have [they] have metal in there. So I don’t know, it's a little bit silly. Hopefully, though, they will be sensible and, you know, and the stewards should be there to keep us safe most importantly, but this is not a safety issue. Thanks. Turn 16 I had a bit of an oversteer moment, I went a bit wide in 16. Then the rest of their sector just wasn't that great. So a bit of time for sure was lost last there, which is obviously frustrating.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Alex Albon,"Good, thank you. Yeah, it feels good to be back. Yeah, I came here, obviously. I feel ready. I feel as fit as I can be. And we had a good week of training, or two weeks almost, to get back to where we are today. So, you know, we'll see how it goes. Obviously, we are realistic. And we know that we're coming to the most difficult race of the year, so we do have to be mindful of that. But I feel good. I've been karting. It's felt okay, so, yeah… No pain, no pain. Yeah, well, firstly, I was supposed to be asleep for a few days. And I woke up pretty much 30 minutes before the start of the race. So I could watch it. But as you said, it was it was frustrating to watch, the heart rate went up a little bit, and they were keeping an eye on me and they told me I had to switch it off at some point. But, you know, it's only because we had such a good car on Friday, at least, and when I woke up on Saturday, there was kind of that decision of should you risk it or not, in terms of driving. But we did the right thing. And you know, Nyck did a really good job obviously. We know that Monza was going to be a good one. But he brought home some points, which obviously in the bigger scheme of things is very good for the team. I don't believe so. But, you know, we never know. I think we've surprised ourselves a little bit this year with some circuits. So we'll give it a go. This circuit’s a little bit more down towards you know, let's say, downforce and there's a few corners here. So not quite like Monza, but we'll give it a go. Yeah, so firstly, I would say it was more kind of bed recovery to begin with. It's quite a tricky one because you're basically waiting for your lungs to recover. And at the same time, your body can't move as well as it normally can. So you can't just jump back into normal training, you have to slowly build into it. So it was kind of starting Monday last week when we really started to push it and see what we can do. I treated it like a nine-to-five job, training and recovery. Of course, recovery is really important. So yeah, basically throwing everything at it. And day by day I was getting better and better. And then obviously, we got to a point where the recovery was going really well. I don't think we truthfully had in mind, Singapore on the cards, but just with the speed of the recovery, it was definitely a possible thing. And as I said, we sat long and hard to think about it. You know, shall we do it or not? And I feel like I am ready. So, you know, of course, we'll have to wait until FP1 and tomorrow to see where it’s at, because driving around here is a bit of a different beast. But yes. And then in terms of, I guess, setbacks? It's a small one really. I've missed out on a race. I've been very lucky. I've had very good doctors around me, who were in Italy, to get me back into a good place. So I feel very fortunate. And yeah, I only missed out on a race. So it's not a big deal. I'd say it's more Singapore. I think it's the humidity. I think everyone's touched upon it. It is the hardest race of the year, that's for sure. I'm not sure how the others feel about it, but I feel like these cars are quite different, maybe not quicker, but they are physical in their own ways. They are so stiff. It is a different toll on your body. So, you know, in terms of actually the surgery side, I'm not worried about that at all. I know that's fully recovered. It's more just the after effects of being in intensive care, basically, and the toll that has on your body. But like I said, I wouldn't be here if I if I didn't think I could be able to race. Luckily, I was quite drugged up. So I don't remember much of it. I just remember obviously, going into surgery, and it it's a relatively simple procedure, I think it only takes a couple of hours to be operated on. But obviously you don’t understand time when you're sedated. But obviously, it was more of the impact on the people around me. So when I did wake up, I thought everything was… that was the procedure finished. And it was only then they said, ‘Well, you actually have gone through a little bit more than that’. So yeah, I think in the end, I was supposed to be in, I guess you would call it an induced sedation, for two to three days, but in the end my lungs cleared out within 12 hours, so I was already up pretty much shortly after. And as I said, it wasn't such a big thing for me, it was more seeing… You know, my family came to the race and all that kind of thing. And obviously they were a little bit in shock. So yeah, that was about it. I'd say mainly, we're looking at long runs, I think obviously, the short runs, anyone… It’s quite a comfortable thing to be able to drive these cars. But by FP2 especially you do get a really good idea of how it's going to feel on your body for the race. So like I said, I'm not planning to not race. I'm planning to be there and truthfully I feel pretty confident in my body but of course nothing quite compares it to the actual toll of driving these cars. So yeah, that's really it, you know. I think as a driver, you'll know straightaway what your body can do. I'd say, you know, I'm not too focused on it, to be honest with you. I feel like in terms of the leader role, I'm already feeling like we're working well together. And the dynamic is not going to change next year. Just keep on going as we are. And then whoever's across the other side of the garage, it is whoever it is, you know. You've can only focus on yourself. And like I said, even for me now, it's more focused on race by race, and that will be the same going into next year. Yeah, most probably he would also want us to wait ‘till he wins it if we comment about it, but no, it's obviously very, very impressive and I think also you have to give credit to Red Bull as well. I think they've been on been upgrading their car quite a lot through the year and they seem to have made a step and I don’t want to say that they're pulling away from the others, but it seems like they're clearly doing a very good job.",Singapore,thursday,Williams
Lando Norris,"Yeah, well, I think. I've not done too much, just exploring little bits here and there. Yeah, that's it, not too much else. So just having a little look around going to some different restaurants and nice places for dinner and lunch and everything but that’s all. No, nothing serious. Not ideal, but I should be fine for driving so… I'm very excited. For me, one of the coolest tracks on the calendar. At the same time, one of the most difficult to put together, so rewarding I think come qualifying, especially. You’ll probably talk about Lewis' lap a few years ago, but like, completing a lap here and putting everything together and crossing the line it's definitely one of the most rewarding places. Similar to Monaco in some ways, to nail everything and get that feeling inside the inside the car, so I loved it. It was a decent weekend that I had here back in 2019, so my first season, so yeah, I've missed it. It's just warm and sweaty but it's an enjoyable place to come back to and definitely a fun racetrack. It's different. I think there's more say, more slow-speed corners, less kind of medium to high-speed, which I think Monaco has a little bit more of. Of course you’ve got the final corner but that's about it. Monaco, I think is… I feel like you've got to take a few more risks here and there. And judging things is a little bit more difficult for my feeling in Monaco. Singapore is a bit more stop and go consistently. So it's a different challenge. I guess there's a lot of walls and if you get too close on the inside or outside you can easily make mistakes but yeah, a different challenge, more corners at the same time, but still tough. Not a lot of room for error, but very enjoyable. Yeah, similar. Well done to him. He's obviously done an incredible job. The team have given him a very good car in order to do so. But yeah, I think everyone kind of expected it as well, especially after last year. You see the battles that they have and how tough it is to produce a good car and to go out and produce these results every single weekend, especially when he starts last and still wins quite easily. It's even good to watch when you're when in the car yourself. Well done to all of them, for after the weekend.",Singapore,thursday,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, it's good to be back. Obviously, 2019 feels like a lifetime ago for everyone. So it's great to be back in this beautiful city. And the track is epic to drive. It's a very, very bumpy ride, 23 corners. I think that night, that lap back in… is it 2018? Yeah. I don't remember every single part of it. I've not re-watched it, but it was definitely one of the best laps of my career. So the hope is always that you can one day get to experience something similar. But the feeling of that day was something very unique. I would definitely say that it was a track that we had struggled out quite a lot. And I think it's probably due to some sort of… I don't think it was aero-based, I think it was more probably ride quality, that we just hadn't been as good as some of the others had been. We'll discover if that's a true philosophy this weekend, or a true theory this weekend. But yeah, I think they've resurfaced some parts of the circuit, so hope hopefully it's not as bouncy as before. We hope that the car works better here. But as I said, it really depends how bumpy it is. And the bumps often set the car off and upset the car in a lot of instances. We do know it's going to be bumpy. Maybe the car will be fine. Maybe it won't. So I have no expectations at all, just going to try and have the best weekend with whatever we're faced with. Oh, 100%. We've learnt a huge amount about the car, which is natural for everyone, but it's definitely a huge help knowing where the working window is, what the working range is. And so we're able to predict pretty much where we're going, whether it will work in one place compared to another. And also the limitations of the car. We know where those limitations are and how to… We just have to try and work around them. So yeah, I think we were very fortunate, we're in a much better place I think, than we've ever been. So I hope that we're not far away. No, there's not really much of an update. At the moment we're still working through the script. And so yeah, I've been out in LA. It wasn't this this trip, but the one before, visiting Jerry's office, which was pretty epic, and sitting with Brad (Pitt) and Joe (Kosinski) and just going through the plot and the plan, It was a pretty epic kind of experience. And then this time, I was just hanging with Jerry. Yeah, we were on set of another movie that was being filmed, which was Eddie Murphy's movie, which was very, very cool. Huge fan of Eddie Murphy, so I got the chance to meet him. And yeah, getting to work and spending time with these people. You're just learning more about the industry and the challenges and how they go about making great movies that we've all grown to love throughout our lives. Yeah, I got to hang with some of the guys that do John Wick, just filming John Wick 4 as well. So just having lots of conversations and trying to learn as much as I can from all these great and talented people. I think the industry is, I think it's literally the… We arrive at a movie theatre and with no comprehension of how much work goes on in the background, how much preparation there is, how big a team there is in the background. They have similar issues with diversity, for example, in terms of behind the camera. I think what I'm most impressed by is seeing some of the organisations for example, like Disney, the real steps… They're really pushing for diversity. They've got a lot of female leadership throughout the different companies, which is great to see, and you’ve already seen on TV today, for example the new Ariel movie that's coming out. I don't know if any of you saw the video of the young kids that are watching and that she's like… she looks… she's the same colour as me. So there's a lot of work that's been done in the industry and there's so much to learn from these people that have been there, the greats. Still, yet to meet Spielberg… one day. From my point of view, I'm not really thinking much about it. Yeah, definitely, I feel for the fans because that's for everyone and even for us, last year, going right down to the wire, that was intense for everybody and so it's never great when the season finishes early, even when I've experienced having it finish early, in places like Mexico. For you as the one individual it’s great, but for the actual sport is not spectacular. So I'm really grateful to have had it like 2008, right down to the last 17 seconds, and obviously last year pretty much the same thing. So yeah, let's hope for the future that it's a bit better. For me, I'm really still enjoying the… We’ve still got six races, I'm still enjoying the challenge and proud of the strength and the growth within our team, in terms of the relationships, in terms of our focus, just seeing how hard everyone works in a team is, for me, the most inspiring thing. They've gone from the racetrack the next… you know, fly over Sunday night, they're in in the office on Monday, trying to come up with solutions, trying to crack the code and that's really impressive because it's just relentless, the season. I know everyone – I'm sure all of you as well – is looking forward to the break, so I hope everyone's planning ahead to maximise and make it efficient. Long time ago – do you remember back then in your life? What were you doing back then? Playing chess? Yeah, so what was the question? What was I feeling at the time? It definitely changed a lot in my life, I think, because I've obviously had that kind of dry spell, I would say more so because I’d taken the step and the leap of faith, moving to another team. That went against most of the advice that I had had from people around me, people that you would consider mentors, who all said to stay where I was, stay put. And the kind of the experience that I had in terms of… It was actually after this race, people seemed to think that it was during this race that I made the decision to move. It wasn't and actually this race had no effect on that. When the gearbox failed here in 2012 that had no effect on my decision, because those things happen. It was more… I think the week after, just sitting in Thailand, just managed to be in a very peaceful place and it really came to me that I was going to take this leap. And so to have taken that step and obviously all the backlash makes you question whether or not you really have made the right decision and I'm so proud and grateful to all the members within the team of how they welcomed me into the team and gave me the position to be able to fight for a world title. And so with all the doubts over the years, and the questions that would play in your mind, whether or not it would ever happen again, of which you always overcome, because you have to continue to believe, to finally then got back into that position, it was a very, very special year, and also for the team who had also been on the receiving end of kind of the negativity that they're not going to… perhaps they're not good enough or whatever it may be. So it was it was a huge, huge moment and that really kind of catapulted us into the next years of success and development and what a journey it’s been.",Singapore,thursday,Mercedes
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, exactly. So I went to the best training centre basically in France, MMA factory, it's called. I was there with Mick actually, who got to do a bit of sparring. But yeah, I mean, I love the sport, there are some great values and obviously has become legal to fight now, in France, in MMA and the UFC has come to Paris recently. So it was a huge event. And there are some great French athletes and for me, it was important also to bring a friend of mine giving him the opportunity, you know, to meet the best coaches in the world and, you know, to place him there was very important for me, so, you know, now it's up to him to get on there and fight with the best. Yeah, first of all, it's great to be back here and had such a warm welcome since I arrived, a lot of cool presents, cool drawings. You know, we visited a mall this morning for a car launch, for our car launch, the road car. And yeah, there were so many, you know, supporters cheering for us. And that's definitely boosting us for the weekend. But, yeah, I mean, it's a challenging track, really challenging. There's a lot of corners, as we said. It's hard to pull it together, especially with these cars, which are very stiff, you know. There are some curves which are quite sharp, quite hard on the body. So it's going to be an interesting one, but I feel ready. Yeah, I mean, fantastic job by the team to keep developing the car like we've done since the beginning of the year. We've made huge steps each time something was coming. So I look forward to see what it’s going to give us. You know, it's quite a big upgrade. But again, you know, it's important for us to have a clean weekend and hopefully use it the best we can. Yeah, very, very impressive season, especially I think the way… you know when Max was starting in the back and just flying through the field I think this has been quite impressive in terms of just like first lap knowing where to place the car and all that. I think he's been on top of his game this year so once he wins the title congratulations.",Singapore,thursday,Alpine
Mick Schumacher,"I wasn't the friend he was just mentioning. I’m not going to UFC! No. But he showed me some moves, which was interesting. So now I can defend myself. Yeah, I mean, I can only refer to what everybody else is saying, as I've never raced here myself. So I guess that the humidity is one of the points that probably everybody talks about, but also the track itself as you know. I've done a few simulator sessions on this track and watched a load of videos on this place, but really excited to go out there and make my own kind of experiences of this place. That’s for Japan. Well, without going in too much, I think what he's done was… well, it's quite impressive. He's had a tough start to the season but then turned it around pretty well with Red Bull and definitely it seems to work out for them.",Singapore,thursday,Haas
Valtteri Bottas,"As always hard to predict. I do hope so. We don't have any proper upgrades here but small tweaks here and there. It's a very, very different type of circuit to Monza. Now it's back to pretty much maximum downforce so it's hard to predict but I hope so because I haven't really scored in a while, obviously, due to many DNFs and penalties as well. But yeah, I really hope to get back to good form and especially in qualifying, you know, we need to qualify well here if we want some points. I think we learned a lot from Monaco and from Baku as well. We've learned huge amounts since so I'm expecting better than in those weekends. I think it's good news because following him alongside as a teammate, I really can say that he deserves the spot in the team and in Formula 1. He's really mature for his age and experience and he's been learning a lot throughout the year and his pace has been increasing in qualifying and the race throughout the year and he's done very few mistakes. So yeah, I think it's good news and I'm sure he keeps evolving and keeps improving in the future. How few mistakes he's done, because it's not easy to jump into F1 and for sure, he's got lots of outside pressure as well, being the first Chinese driver and everything but he's dealt with everything in a really good way. For now! I think, speaking of saunas, I think good comparison is actually it's like a mild, humid sauna. Because that's how it does feel in the car and obviously we're wearing the fireproofs with the underlayer, which are not the most breathable things and also the airflow in the car is actuall,y in the cockpit, is not really much, if any, so for sure that temperature already and how much you lose fluids, that's a big thing. But on top of that, the track is like intense, you know, there's not much time to rest and somebody mentioned before, it's bumpy as well and that drains your body even more. So just the whole race distance, which is up to two hours, towards the end you definitely feel fatigued. It's hard work. That's the best I can describe it. I'm pretty much with Carlos. I feel like it’s same, same. It is a learning process always with the new type of tyres and every weekend we keep learning more so yeah, it's a bit variable but I think the same.",Singapore,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, especially 2014 was a great, great race, coming from the back. I had front wing damage, managed to recover and get into the points. It was a great, great race and yeah, a really good run of results here which I look forward to… I've never been on the podium here so I really hope on Sunday, I can get to know it. I think physically it's one of the biggest challenges of the season, if not the biggest. And also, I think from the level of driving, so many corners and during the race it's so important just to keep the car out of the walls. I think Monza was also close and I do expect the Ferrari to be very strong here, they've been very strong in all the street courses so I do expect them to be particularly strong around this place. I think… yeah, also Mercedes. They've certainly been there in the last few races. With Mercedes, I think they either are very strong or they are a little bit weaker. But if they're strong, they will be in the mix for sure. There is a point in the race where it just keeps getting hotter and hotter. The more laps you do, the worse it gets. There is a time where you’re actually praying for a Safety Car, a bit of cool down because it's really demanding, the last 20 laps or so. It's mentally really tough. And, as I say, it just keeps getting worse and worse. I think after lap 15, it's already pretty warm. And it just gets worse from there. I find this one tougher because of the amount of cornering you have. You know, I think in Malaysia, it gets really warm – I remember one year there, 2016, was super-hot – but still you have some straights where at least you can relax your body. And here, even if you’re on the straight, you’re bouncing around and there is not much time before you can brake, so I find Singapore the toughest. I think Miami, we all got caught out with how demanding it was, we were not expecting – but once we got there with the weather, I think we were all surprised how how demanding it was. But I think yeah, Singapore is the toughest this year. Not really, I think Carlos covered it well. But yeah, we were put in the situation by the circuits basically, so it's something that has to be reviewed. And hopefully, we can make it better, because simply, there is so much space we can have and that is not enough. If something goes wrong at the pit-stop from another team, then there is just no room for it to be avoidable. I don't think it changes from my side. I think we have to do our own thing. Certainly I think it's a matter of time before Max becomes a champion. So, from our side, it's important to focus on our side and try to deliver the maximum results we possibly can and finish our season on a high these next six races. I think for me, the only concern is the warm-up. Sometimes when you're behind the Safety Car with these low blanket temperatures that we are we running. I think already for next year, they're trying to go even lower, which I feel like they're putting the driver at risk. Because there are some situations, some scenarios, where it can become quite dangerous, you know, cold track temperatures and Safety Cars and so on. It can be a bit of a risk for some drivers. So I think that's the only real concern I have with this tyres at the moment",Singapore,thursday,Red Bull
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, I went home for a bit, yeah, I went to Canada which was nice, catch up with some friends and stuff. Yeah. Yeah, it's a great, great track, really challenging. Physically, it's always a tough one but also just technically, it's a lot of corners. Not much room for error and just a very, very technical track so it's good to be back and looking forward to it. Yeah, I think we should be more competitive than we were in Monza. I think Monza was probably… definitely our worst weekend of the year. We've been a bit better on the higher downforce tracks so yeah, hoping we can step it up this weekend. Yeah, I mean, not much more to add. It's, you know, cognitively very challenging: 23-24 corners, whatever it is, the race generally goes over two hours. It's really hot. So yeah, it's a challenge for sure. Yeah, I think we've had a couple of difficult years since 2020. Just circumstances and yeah, you know, there's, I think we know the reasons why. I think we're in a rebuilding phase, I think there's a lot of talented people that have already been in the team for a long time. And, you know, there's a lot of talented people that are joining the team. And I think that process takes a little bit of time. Yeah, and, you know, I'm definitely confident, you know, looking at the future, the direction we're heading. But it just, like I said, takes a bit of time. And regarding Fernando, I think it's really exciting. He's, you know, obviously a really talented driver, has a lot of experience. So, yeah, I'm definitely looking forward to working alongside him. Yeah, I think the tyres are more like low working range. So just harder pushing on the out laps generally. I don't think it's more difficult, I just think it's different. You know, it's different, the front tyre seems a lot weaker, so it just behaves quite differently. And it just takes some getting used to, but I think yeah, we're just going to get better every race with understanding the tyres.",Singapore,thursday,Aston Martin
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, I must say that was a very, very unique experience. My brothers have always been a massive support for me because since I started, they’ve always been behind me through the good and bad times. And I have a big family: four brothers, and three of them raced in karting so they kind of know the basics of driving. We always go karting together, but they never had any formula or single seater experience and at the start of the year it was like, can we get one or two times a year the chance to get all together, which is not enough for me so I found another reason. I was like, I’ve got to find a cool, cool idea to get the whole family together and yeah, I came up with that activity. And it's just amazing to see how competitive we are in the family. Already after the first session, they already had all the driver excuses sorted with the tail wind and the cold tyres, and the brakes were not ready etc. It was just hilarious, just to be part of it and just a very cool, family time and I really enjoyed it. Well, actually so there were my four brothers and my best friend. Unfortunately, my best friend beat all my four brothers by five tenths. Three of them were pretty impressive and one of them was more like on a Sunday ride, but no, they were all pretty impressive. And just a couple of spins here and there, a couple of lockups. They liked it so much that they are going again next Wednesday without me for another track day. So they really got into it. I will say, well, slightly different to Lance. I think we've been slightly more competitive in low downforce tracks, so Spa was good, Monza was good but all the tracks with high downforce, we seem to struggle a bit more. So hopefully these upgrades we have this weekend can change a bit that picture. We know the McLarens are usually pretty fast in these conditions. Alpine sometimes are really fast, these guys have done as well. So I don't really have any expectations. I just hope that the upgrade brings us more speed and I know if that's the case, then we will have our chances to fight for points. Well, he's been a bit grumpy, not so happy, like all of us, with how the season is going but I think it's just important to stay positive and, you know, still be constructive until the end of the year because it's obviously insignificant for some people when you're fighting for seventh place in the team championship, but you're talking still about a lot of money for next season. No, that's clearly the target, at least to get Haas and you know, Alfa 19 points, considering I think we have only 33 points after 16 races. That's a lot to ask, but nothing is impossible. We've seen it in the past, we just need one really strong result and it will be possible. So definitely Haas, we’re going to get them and then yeah, we'll see coming to Abu Dhabi what we're fighting for. I would expect… Obviously everybody knows the ongoing conversation and discussion but on my side, I think, hopefully in the next two, three weeks, hopefully we should have a clear answer on my future. But yeah, so far, nothing has changed and when there will be something confirmed on my future, I'm sure you guys will know about it. Yeah, just agree with the guys. I mean, it's definitely the hardest one of the season but it's actually difficult to compare it with anything else, because you know, these conditions, we face it only once or twice a year. I mean, having such humidity, already when I see how many sweaty people there are in the paddock just walking around. You can imagine how we how we feel inside the race car with the all the fireproofs, balaclava, race suits… So, I will say one of the biggest challenge I find on my side is we lose so much fluid. We lose up to 2.5kg – or 2.5l because it's mainly fluids from our body – so does the impact it has on our focus and concentration. There is the physical demand but there's also the challenge on the focus where you got to stay super alert because you're driving full speed between the walls, need to be extremely precise where you put the car and that's usually when it gets tough where you got to be still really at the limit of the car, playing with centimetres. Having lost quite a quite a few pounds or litres inside your body. So yeah, that's definitely the biggest challenge of the year. Look at this physique! Like, that's impressive! I remember that actually! I will say on our side, I will say it has been easier. I think the fact that.. So, the blankets are lower, it makes it quite straightforward. Most of the tracks we’re going to be pushing harder in the out lap compared to last year, where sometimes we ended up going extremely slow on the out lap and not working on the side of the tyre. And I feel clearly last year there was a lot more focus in terms of procedure and a lot more varieties of out laps through the season compared to this year. And yeah, struggled more last year with getting the front tyres ready coming into Turn 1, getting front locks. So I will say on that side, with the car that we have, it's been easier. Not completely easy, you still get it wrong Sometimes, but at least it's a more straightforward picture in our approach to out laps.",Singapore,thursday,AlphaTauri
Carlos Sainz,"I'm not sure what's the secret, I just know that it’s a great track, it’s a great place to come and race in. Yeah, also the weather, like we saw in 2017, can sometimes play a bit of a part. I saw some rain forecast here and there for the weekend. It’s bumpy, it’s tough, it’s busy. I think both mentally and physically is the toughest race of the season. So yeah, let's see how it feels on these stiff cars. Also, that is going to be another new challenge. I mean, if they think we are going to be competitive, imagine what we think how they're going to be if they won the last five or six races! I don't know. So yeah, I think we can bring the fight definitely, especially in qualifying. And it's a track where  in the race, if you're ahead then you can you can stand a bigger chance of winning the race, no? So what we did in Monza or Spa when we were starting ahead of them, so yeah, we're gonna give it our best shot, try nailing the qualifying and see what we can do in the race. We are concerned about getting back to winning, more than Mercedes. Honestly, if we know we get back to winning before the end of the season, then the battle with Mercedes should be sorted. I think we have both cars always qualifying in the top three, top four. So yeah, we need to get that race pace back, like we did in Monza: we had a much better race pace and like this we don't get out-raced on Sunday from the Merc. I think we just need to get focusing on trying to be the Red Bull whenever we can, and, and that should sort out the championship battle. It's easy for me, I've never struggled here! No, I remember when I was here in 2015-2016, warning Pierre and Charles, ‘did you train for Singapore?’ and they came back like ‘why?’ So you will see why. Since then, I think it’s no secret that this place, it’s a bit of an oven for all of us. I find what Pierre said very interesting. To keep mentally sharp is the most difficult because the heat, you'll leave me in the car for another half an hour, driving at a certain speed I could survive but if you want those last three-tenths of performance or focus. It's really mentally challenging to keep them because of how draining it is. And the vibrations of the car is difficult to keep the eye-line. And it's anti clockwise, so also the neck is sometimes suffering. You know, when I’m training in pre-season, January and February, I'm thinking about Singapore. I'm not thinking about the first race or, the others. For me it’s if you survive Singapore, then you're fit for anything else in in Formula 1. Personally, I would like six consistent races, a bit of gathering momentum before next year. Because this year, for me, has been characterised by never getting more than two or three consecutive good races, always have a reliability issue, bad pit-stop, a strategy issue that comes into play. When you're about to get in a good run of races, you know, that is so important in Formula 1 to gather a bit of momentum and get the confidence for the team and for myself building. So, we come from Monza, which was a pretty strong race for me and a good comeback. Also, fighting for pole position, even with a penalty. So yeah, hopefully from now on a bit more of that and just more podium finishes, and, more importantly, a win. That I think would be ideal to break the Red Bull record and try to keep ourselves winning and keeping having that good momentum into next year. Yeah, for me is not the pit crews or the F1 teams really that need to make changes, it's the FIA and Formula 1 organisation, they need to make sure this…  They need to find a solution to these tight pit-lanes because, I said it once and I say it again, one day there's going to be an accident and one day there's going to be a human involved that’s hurt because of how tight everything is when there's a Safety Car and we're all pitting at the same time. Like in Budapest a year ago when we pitted in the formation lap. In Zandvoort when the Safety Car came out, it was chaos and we need to find a solution, because I feel like we are putting someone's own health at risk you know? We need to… circuits get homologated and if, in order to get homologated, we need a wider pit lane and a longer pit lane to have spacing between cars, we need to make sure that happens. But I know logistically and technically is not easy for the circuits but I was in a pretty scary situation in Zandvoort and it could happen anytime soon. So yeah, it's something that is a matter that we need to raise between FIA, Formula 1, who usually F1 teams can help to come up with solutions. So let's see. I think it is more difficult, but only because we have less years of experience with them, I think we will get to a point where we will understand them better, but it's only the first year. Every time we go to a track, it's the first time we are with those tyres at that track. So, we are always hit with surprises for each track, what is the right window for these compounds of this year. But I'm convinced that with the experience that we have this year, whenever we come back next year, if Pirelli doesn't change massively, the tyre compounds and the construction, then it will be a lot easier to hit the targets. I think it's just a matter of experience with this new set of tyres.",Singapore,thursday,Ferrari
Sebastian Vettel,"Well, I think every teammate you have is different. Everyone has different driving styles, everyone wants something different from the car and works with the team in a different way. So I have no clue. I've never worked with him before. I've never been teammates with him. So, yeah, I'm sure he will be different. But like I said, every teammate is unique in their own way.",Singapore,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, we had a great race. On every compound, we were quickest. And the deg was very good, so we had a really good race car. I was just controlling the gap at the end, but of course then the Safety Car came out. Unfortunately, we didn't get a restart. But overall, we had again a really good day. Yes, the start was very good. I had a clean chicane. And then I could quickly, you know, get back into my rhythm and get into second. And yeah, we just… It was really good on the tyres and was really enjoyable to drive today, even though it was quite tough out there. But yeah, a great day for us. Yeah, took a bit of time to be on a great podium like this but finally we won it. Umm, yeah, we had a great view. It's a… It's a nice area, you know, to stand on. Well, the atmosphere for me, it was not amazing. But it is what it is. I think so, yeah. I mean, today was very hot and we could really look after our tyres. Of course, it helped a lot that I had a great first lap, and I could clear most of the cars before they got into, let's say, a DRS train. And, yeah, from there onwards, basically, both tyres sets felt great and I could extend the first one a bit. And even on the Mediums, everything worked out really well. Well, I mean, you never know what is going to happen before Turn 1, right. But yeah, it worked out really well for me. Yeah, they told me opposite Charles, so it could have gone either way, I guess. Yeah, I mean, of course, it's amazing what we are experiencing within the team. I think, you know, we are having an amazing year. And it's important to enjoy it as well. I think we've had a lot of different challenges on different kinds of tracks and now the car really seems to work at every track. And yeah, we are extremely pleased. Yeah, my final year in karting. But it’s very different in terms of feelings. At the time, your goal is Formula 1, so of course you're enjoying what you're achieving but you also think there's such a long way still left before you get to Formula 1. So it's a bit of a different wave of excitement and what you feel. But that final year in go-karting was nice, too. You didn't see him, right? Of course! Yeah – but from what I understood, was that the car was stuck in gear and that's why it took so long . Because, of course, when the car's parked there, there is no gap where you can push the car into, compared to some other places. And that's why the crane had to come. And that's why I guess they just run out of time. So, I guess it was very unfortunate. Normally, I think everyone wants to finish under green flag. But yeah, unfortunately, we were just short of laps. But I mean, I had a new Soft as well so I was not too worried. I mean, even if it was one lap shootout. I saw him battling in front of me when he was defending tenth at the time. And, yeah, for Nyck to jump in and deliver this performance is definitely… you know, it's not easy at all. I think he did a great job from the things I saw, also in terms of defending. He just kept his cool,  didn't make mistakes and I'm very happy for him to score the points. It's impressive, of course, in your first race, Yeah, a bit unexpected, right? We talked about it last night. I know him very well. He's a great friend of mine. I think I just explained what happened with the car being stuck in gear just took too long and you run out of laps, and then they still had to get rid of a few cars in between which then… you need them to catch up. We ran out of laps, they needed to extend the race but that's not possible. First of all, enjoy it and don't think about it too much, don't stress about it too much. I remember my first one… it happens so quickly everything but I think more probably if you just tell yourself we'll see what happens instead of really stressing out. I need a good start. I need a good first lap. You shouldn't think about that and I think he handled everything really well of course. But yeah, it's nice. We know each other really well so it was just a quick little motivation speech. When it happens, of course, everyone speaks to me about it, with the booing and stuff. But at the end of the day, I'm here to try and win the race which done. Some people, of course, they can’t appreciate that but that's of course because they're very passionate fan of a different team. And this is what it is. It's not going to spoil my day. I'm just enjoying the moment. I explained before: because the car was very overweight, it was just the wrong place of the car as well overweight so that's why it was just understeering a lot  more and prone to front locking. So I don't think it will be a problem in Singapore but maybe we encounter different kind of things. We haven't been there in a while, it's normally quite a bumpy track, so we just need to work on the setup, see how these cars react to the bumps and try to go as fast as possible.",Italy,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, the end was frustrating. I wish we could have ended up racing, but unfortunately then we were second at that place, no, because of what happened before. So, it's a shame. Overall, I gave it all today. I wish I could have won in front of the amazing tifosi we have here, but I just couldn’t today. To be honest, we didn't know what they were going to do behind, so we took that choice. Well, obviously we finished P2, so I'm not extremely happy with the race but we'll work on that. I don't know. I think the pace was quite strong today. We'll have to look into it but I think we were quite strong but, yeah, it just wasn't enough. It's always incredible. Then, as you said, starting from pole, I wanted to get that win. And we didn't. So it's a bit… yeah… not the best day, but the podium makes it a lot better. Honestly, I think the first choice was to stop under the Virtual Safety Car. I think we all had the doubt. I think if I wouldn't have done it, Max would have done it. It was a bit unfortunate, because in the middle of the pit lane, we had the Virtual Safety Car ending, so we didn't get all the benefits of stopping at that moment. And from that moment onward, we were a little bit on the back foot – but yeah, it's like this. No, I had a bit of a strange behaviour out of Turn 5 on the bump there and so we were just trying to figure it out and try to not get this small problem. It wasn't costing a lot of time but it wasn't so great to drive. Yes, exactly. After Spa, I think we were quite worried. We were very, very far in qualifying but also in race pace, compared to Red Bull. I think this weekend we've been working massively, especially FP1, FP2, trying to test different directions for this car and it was better. Yesterday we were fighting for pole, which was a surprise Today the pace was also much, much better. We cannot forget either that our car is maybe not the best for this type of track – but I think it was a positive weekend overall. I don’t know – but in the last race it was pretty tight with you too! I didn’t see him, with these new cars it’s difficult! Yeah, obviously I really wanted for this race to start again. But yeah, I mean, from the car, I didn't understand because the last time we passed through, the track was clean. So, I really thought that we will restart again. But it didn't happen. So maybe there are things in the background that I didn't know that didn't make the restart possible. Well, I think we need to look first at how much we lost. I think it will have been very, very difficult anyway.  We probably would have had a bit more margin to Max behind and maybe we will have just give a shot to finish the race on a medium, which was not a possibility because Max was too close with these fresh tyres so we knew we just had to stop before he caught us, so yeah, it was like that. I think nobody likes booing and I think it shouldn't happen. That's it. But then for the flares, personally I think it's okay when it's used maybe before the formation lap or laps to the grid or something. But then sometimes during the race, it can be a bit confusing for us. But it's the way it is.  After the chequered flag there was a little bit but to me this was not too disturbing.",Italy,post-race,Ferrari
George Russell,"Yeah, thank you. I think I said on the radio to the team, it doesn't matter if we're fast or slow, we keep getting these podiums. Unfortunately, this weekend we definitely weren't where we wanted to be as a team but nevertheless we can look back on these three races – two podiums and a P4. We've got to be satisfied with that. I mean, we had to do something different if we wanted to fight with Max and Charles, but unfortunately they were just too quick for us today. I'm pleased that we tried something, that's what we have to do in the position we are at the moment. Absolutely. It’s an incredibly sad time around the world and for the British people, but what a life and a life that should be celebrated. I think how Max and Red Bull performed were kind-of in-line with our expectations, especially ahead of the weekend. But I think Ferrari, and Charles especially, surprised us a bit with how strong they performed. I thought we maybe had half a chance to battle with Charles today, but he showed some really strong pace. And it was just quite a long and lonely race to be honest. Our car certainly wasn't performing at its best around this circuit. I think we have a good idea why that is, and sort-of happy that these low downforce, high-speed circuits are behind us now. Yeah! Got pretty tight! What was that quote, was it Montoya said in Imola, 2004? “If you couldn’t see me there on the outside…” Yeah, it was all good. Charles had the inside line, and he had the right to push me a bit wide. So, that was the most exciting part of my race, to be honest. Probably not, no, to be honest. But I think, to be fair to the whole of our team, we weren't really planning on using the Hard and we didn't think it was a fantastic tyre. But we just felt like we had to do something different to Max and Charles. If we stayed on the Medium, if we did Soft-Medium as they planned, we were going to finish behind them. So, it was a risk worth taking. But being on a Medium, it wouldn't have transformed the race either. No, not at all, to be honest. I think we have that pretty well covered. More so than we've seen here, there's no doubt about it. I think, on paper, Singapore should suit our car – but when we look back at the street circuits of Monaco and Azerbaijan, our car doesn't fare too well over the bumps. So, we're not too sure how it will fall out. But we need to keep on pushing, keep on improving the car and I'm pleased that we've got a clear direction we need to go now. It’s just racing, I think. It’s obviously not always easy when the car stops in an awkward place. We always want to end a race under green flag but you know, what can you do? It's just how the game goes. And I don't know what the race picture looked like but I don't think it would have changed the result, either way. What is clear though, is these one-stop races, minimal tyre deg, they don't seem to offer that much of an exciting race – but I don't know, I haven't obviously seen what the race was like behind us. Yeah, he obviously did an excellent job and yeah, impressive. Throughout all of our karting career - the three of us race against him - knew him well, and he was always one of the very best and there's no doubt he's deserve another place in Formula 1. So that's just how the sport is. Sometimes, you know, there’s 20 drivers, not everybody gets an opportunity but certainly now he's proved everything he has to. Yeah, the same.  You can't extend the race. Following Abu Dhabi, we had some discussions about races ending under the safety car. I think we looked at every single race since ’98 and it happened 10 times. Maybe  that's wrong, don't quote me on that but maybe it's worth looking at. But you can't extend the race without enough so it’s just how it is. I think probably tougher for him to be honest than it was for me because I was obviously a full time race driver then and equally as well for him jumping from Aston Martin on Friday into a Williams; it's a different car,  the seating position is different. I remember when I was doing testing with Mercedes, Force India at the time and driving F2 it took quite a few laps just to get used to the different feeling of how those cars reacted. As I said, there's not a lot more to say;  to score points on your debut in a Williams, it's pretty spectacular no doubt.",Italy,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I’ll start in English, I'll finish in Italian, as always. But yeah, it's amazing. I mean, it wasn't an easy qualifying session. I knew that there was quite a bit of potential in the car but I didn't put everything together. I knew that in this last lap in Q3 I had to put everything together and I managed to do it, so very happy with the lap, very happy with the performance. It has been a great weekend until now. The feeling with a car is amazing. And I really hope that we can do just like in 2019 tomorrow. I just took much more risk! It was the last lap and I knew I had to find quite a lot of performance there and I just went for it and it worked out. It feels really, really good. We still need to finalise this tomorrow, otherwise it's pointless to do the pole on Saturday, but it is a very good surprise today, considering where we come from, especially in Spa. We were not expecting to fight for pole here. So it's a very good surprise at home. Yeah, there's a special motivation for this weekend and it’s great that we managed to do a good job today. I mean, in FP1 and FP2 we tested a lot of things across cars, with Carlos, a lot of different things and we found different directions that were interesting. We were really struggling a lot in Spa and, yeah, we found some pace. So it's good. It shows that we worked in the right direction and I hope that tomorrow we can show that in the race also. There's always something more, no? But the lap, I'm extremely happy with. In the first run of Q3, I didn’t do a great lap, but then managed to put everything together on the second lap. So yeah, there's always a bit more, but I'm very, very happy with that one. Well, a good start, obviously, as always, and then we'll see. I think the race pace is strong, the feeling was really, really good. So, whatever happens in the first lap, I think we still have the pace to win this race, so we'll try to put everything together, no mistakes during the race and I think we can have a good Sunday. I think more the experience that I gained from 2019 to now will be more helpful than the experience in 2019. I was a very, very different driver, struggling a lot in races at the time and now I'm in a much better place. So yeah, in 2019 I was not so confident going into the race. This year,  it's better and honestly the feeling was really good on the high fuel. So it's not going to be easy because for sure Max will be extremely quick and will be coming back but I'm sure that we can make this work. The lap was on the limit and I had some snaps here and there but overall, I'm very happy with the car balance and yeah, also with this downforce level I felt like the car is very predictable this weekend and just very happy with the feeling that I get from the car. So it's a good time for tomorrow, Well, I think overall, after each mistake we learned from them and we try to be better as a team. It's not because we are here in Monza that it's more important than other races to not doing any mistakes. We need to become a team that does no mistakes wherever we go. So yeah, it is a special weekend for us but the target for us doesn't change. We just need to have a clean race and a good race. So yeah, we'll be targeting that, and let's see.",Italy,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was close. But of course, we chose to go for a bit more downforce around here and I think over one lap it's maybe not the best. But I think for tomorrow it can be quite strong – and also knowing that we have to start a bit back, you know. But I think, all in all, it was still a good lap. I’ve enjoyed the whole weekend so far and I think it will be an interesting battle tomorrow. Yeah, just you know, trying to stay out of trouble, of course, in the beginning and then just work my way forward. Yeah, I think the lap was pretty decent. Just the first sector we seem to be a little bit slow. So probably better straight-line speed, bit of the first chicane, not finding the right grip, but I think overall the rest of that felt pretty strong. Yeah, we chose, of course, the downforce level a bit higher, compared to some other cars but it felt alright and, of course, you know around here qualifying to race can always feel a bit different and my race runs, they felt really good, so very happy with that pace. So, I'm actually really looking forward to the race tomorrow. I should normally be better for tyre deg, and hopefully we can show that tomorrow. With what I've seen from the long runs, it looks good from our side. I just need to have a clean Lap One, clear the cars in between us quite quickly, and then I think we still have a good chance, yeah. I think it's P7. Unless I'm stupid. But I think it's P7. No, seventh. You need to read the rules. I think (compared) to some other cars, we still have very good top speed. I think it's just Ferraris’ a little bit faster than us on the straights so I'm still expecting to get through the field and hopefully once I get close to Charles, it will be a bit more of a battle but then we have to rely on just a bit more downforce through  the corners.",Italy,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, no, it was honestly a very good quali session. I was feeling very well and I was pushing flat out through Q1, Q2, and Q3. The only issue is that in Q3 I didn't have a tow and this probably cost me those two or three tenths, you know, in the battle for pole position. But, you know, I'm starting last anyway tomorrow, so it's not like it changes my life. But yeah, very good lap. I had to take a lot of risks to compensate for the lack of tow. I was quicker in every corner but slower in every straight. So in the end I could not improve much. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to lie. It hurts to be starting at the back tomorrow, especially with how competitive the car is this weekend. How good I'm feeling on the car, especially after this quali. And to know that I'd be starting at the back… I mean, I will do my best and I will try to put on a good show and make it back through the field because the pace is there, but I wish I could be there at the front with Charles in order to try and do a 1-2 tomorrow for the tifosi. It was a good run. I had a bit of a messy out-lap because I didn’t manage to find a good tow and I had to slow down a bit before the last corner to see if Lando was going through and giving me a tow – but he was clever enough not to do it. It’s a shame though, because my lap there, the 20.4, I had to without the tow.  And around here it’s a bit costly. It was a lap on the limit: everything that I was losing on the straights, I had to pick it back up on the corners. I still managed to improve my Q3, first run lap by quite a bit. So, yeah, it means that in the corners, I must have pushed quite hard, no? But a bit of a shame not to have the tow to content for pole there. I think the overall feeling of the car since we put the car down in FP1, it was just a lot better than in Spa, the balance was a lot more together. So, it means that all the hard work done over these last couple of weeks is paying off. We've gone back to Maranello and put a lot of effort in trying to understand where can we do better and why maybe last two races haven't been going as planned. It doesn't mean that tomorrow we will be a lot more competitive, but it at least means that for today, we've put ourselves on pole and P3 at a track that we didn't expect. So, I'm happy for that and hopefully we can do a good recovery tomorrow. I don't know! I'm going to push obviously, flat out from the beginning, try to make as many positions at the start, and just get to the front as quick as possible. Because then, if there's a Safety Car or anything, then anything can happen around Monza. I think it’s going to be a very mixed race, there’s a lot of cars out of position. So, there's going to be a lot of battles during the whole race. It's going to be quite a hectic one, especially those first 20 laps, I think. But then everything should settle down. Where can I get to? I wish top five like in France would be a good result. But given how quick the Mercedes are lately, is going to be a bit more tricky. For sure. I mean, the feeling that we have as drivers here is… it cannot be compared to anything else. Since the moment we leave the hotel, ‘til the moment we go back to a hotel, there's just a massive push and a massive cheer for us everywhere we go to. There's a particular excitement about Ferrari, about us here. It's a very special feeling that is very difficult to describe. I always struggled to describe it, but this, for sure, it's given us an extra tenth this weekend that we hope we can use to our advantage tomorrow. Yeah, I think it's no secret that the last - I don't want to put that number - but I would say five, seven races have been a lot closer over one lap pace, and I've been battling for a lot more pole positions and a lot better qualifying recently. Race pace is still a bit of an unknown for me going into tomorrow because we couldn't go as many long runs as I would have wished. And also recently, race pace is a bit of a thing that I want to improve or keep improving, but at least the improvement that I've done with the car together with my engineers trying to get myself a bit more comfortable, trying to change a bit the driving towards what Charles was doing, and that was exploiting the car to a limit, has also been working well and I'm fighting a lot more and I'm in a much better place. But yeah, let's see tomorrow and the next races. My target is to finish the season strongly, to try and put myself in a good position going into next year.",Italy,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sebastian Vettel,"Well, I like Monza, I love the track. Obviously, there's a lot of memories. I don't… you know I don't wake… I didn't wake up this morning, I won't wake up on Sunday thinking this is the last time in Monza. So it's not how I approached the races but yeah, I'm looking forward to the weekend. It's usually a great atmosphere.  Obviously, having driven for Ferrari in the past, there's a lot of support for Ferrari, a lot of support for Formula 1 so I think we can all look forward to a great weekend. And like I said, for me it has a bit of an extra meaning because I celebrated my first win here. I think it's Monza's 100th anniversary this weekend, so yeah, should be cool. Well, it was a long time ago. But I think your first win always remain something special so to answer your question, probably pretty high but then it's quite a luxury to be able to choose from so many. And for sure, right now, I can't compare all of them but I would say the first one is very special. Also the circumstances, you know; it was a bit of a miracle and fairy tale, pulling it off with a pole and then the race win. So yeah, very special. Yeah, I think overall we’ve made a little bit of progress in the… obviously now the last months but yeah, I think it is very tight, we are in the midfield and it's very tight being at the back of the midfield or just in the middle with a couple of other teams. So it definitely helped us to make small steps forward because we were able here and there to fight for points and that is the target as well for this weekend. Now, here, it's a different track; everybody's running as little downforce as they can so we'll see where it takes us. Got bored and I thought it was something different. Yeah, I've never had the problem with coming out of the hotel but maybe it's Charles' good looks that make him so popular!  No, I think it's an extreme pleasure, it's an honour and I think from what I had experienced in all these years, is just… they're happy for you to drive the red car and push you on. I've had races and bad races; they seem both times equally excited. For sure they love you to be on the podium and meet you there and love Ferrari to do well but even if you don't… it's not like they start to hate you, there's still a lot of love and support. So it's a great feeling as a driver to experience. I think you when you race for Ferrari in Monza, in Italy then you will be confronted with rumours, but like Fernando said rumours are rumours. I haven't heard that particular rumour but yeah, I think it's probably something you have to deal with when you are racing for Ferrari in Italy. But equally in two weeks’ time we will be somewhere else and you have to deal with it less. Yeah, rumours are there but as I said, I don't know anything right now. No, I haven't spoken to him. So, yeah, I don't know. I heard that he… I know him for a long time now and he's a very clever and intelligent guy. So I don't know. Next time I see him I’ll probably talk to him. But I don't know what the interview was or what the question was to him. I know from my own experience, if you only take bits, then… So, it's not probably not… It's pointless to say anything now because it will only go back, so happier to sort it out with him, if there is anything to sort out or any misunderstanding or anything that he wonders or I don't know. Well, I think it was 2020. But yeah, I mean, obviously, you know, I made the decision to join Aston Martin before I think it was really in discussion that Alex is going to leave. So it was never really close. But of course, I know, Christian, I know Helmut. So for sure. I had a, you know, sort of brief chat with them, but never really anything serious. And I also know and knew that if it was, would have been an option or series, we would have at least talked about it. But it never came to that point. So obviously, a couple of months later, you could look back and say if, and what if, and so on. But I'm happy with the choice I made. And obviously, you know, expected that we will be more competitive last year and this year, but we were not. And I'm very happy with the way the team has progressed and [how] we are working together. So obviously it's not the dream sort of coming true, racing in the positions we are racing, but you know, it's been a challenge and I think I've accepted it and tried to make the most of it. I don't know at the moment, I'm not considering anything, because, you know, I'm stepping away. So, time will tell what will be something that is possible to do, if there is an offer of any such nature or not, and then I will I will see how I feel like, you know, at the moment. I'm quite happy to spend more time on other things and look forward to seeing the kids more and stuff like that. And then time will tell whether I get bored within three months or three years. I don't know. So we will see. Same.",Italy,thursday,Aston Martin
Kevin Magnussen,"Well, I think the car had good performance. Mick qualified P8 which was a good result. That's kind of our…  where we wish to be, in contention for points and stuff like that. So I think I messed up in qualifying and then didn't get out of Q1 although the car had the pace, I just made a mistake and got a bit unlucky with traffic and then I was out so I got my lap deleted even, and had to start 18th. And then in the race I tried…  you’ve got to take risks on the first lap. I got a few positions but then made another mistake in turn two and went off the track and was last so it was a bit of a wasted weekend like that, just  didn't get anything out of it. For this one, probably a little lower. We don't have this super low downforce configuration that you would use here and then in Baku, for example, we also were struggling a bit but in Baku, for example, in the race, we were still a little bit racy. So I thought we could score points there; I had an engine failure so I didn't finish the race but I was running inside the points and that was pretty unexpected with the package we ran there and so naturally I hope we can do that again here but with what we're running, not our favourite track. Pretty obvious;  of course we need fast drivers and drivers that are consistent, can score points, can help drive the team forward but I think right now we have me and Mick and it's not going too badly, I think so I don't really have any strong opinions either way. It's up to Guenther and of course the management to sort that one out. I'm not here to speculate or be involved in that. Again, I'm not here to really take part in that. I don't really have an opinion on that. I think Mick is doing a good job and that's all I can say. Nothing to add really?",Italy,thursday,Haas
Charles Leclerc,"Well, this one is particularly different because for once I'm not red but in yellow. It's a special colour for this weekend to celebrate the 75 years of Ferrari and it's nice and as always the Monza week is just crazy busy for us but it's always an incredible feeling. We had some events yesterday in Milan, so many people, so much support and it's just great. They make you feel at home so  yeah, it's great and hopefully we'll have a good weekend. I like it. I like it. It’s a bit strange now to see me wear yellow this morning with the Ferrari logo but it's cool. I think for one race it's really good. I think it was in 2014 for my first year in single seaters. And I think - but I've got a very bad memory so that might be wrong - but I think this was my first victory in single seaters. So yeah, I always really liked Monza I think it's going to be a bit of a difficult weekend, on paper at least it is going to be a difficult weekend. We expect Red Bull to be stronger. It's not… the track characteristics don't exactly fit our car but again, we've had some good and bad surprises this year so hopefully this one is one of the good ones and that we overperformed compared to what we expect. For me, it's pure pleasure. Of course you can feel the expectations. As I was saying, whenever you are doing the events in Milan, especially, you can see that everybody in the city is behind you, is behind Ferrari and have high expectations but it's part of it. And I take it more as a motivation, more than an added pressure but it's incredible. Even to get out of the hotel it's  pretty difficult to come to the track. I guess it's similar for the drivers but when you are Ferrari there's this little bit more but that just feels really, really nice. Yeah, there are always rumours around a Formula 1 team and especially with Ferrari but I think that what is most important in those moments is not to get distracted with whatever is being said around.  We are very united as a team and I think we need to keep on going like this. We've shown that we've been great from last year to this year doing this type of performance and we need to keep working in that direction. Obviously taking off all of these outside rumours. I didn’t hear that one in particular, but obviously we just have to focus on our own job. I think, comparing to Red Bull especially because it's a bit more consistent throughout the whole year, we are slower down the straights. Their main strength this year are the straight line speeds, we seem to be a bit quicker in the corners. But in tracks like here it's not enough to gain back the advantage that they have on the straights. So compared to Red Bull, I think this will be the case this weekend. Compared to Mercedes, it's a little bit more difficult, it's been a bit up and down. Sometimes they are very, very quick. Sometimes they struggle a bit more, so a bit more difficult to predict. I don't know, I think for the qualifying game, it probably will be the same, because even if it's less worth it, it's still worth it. And people will go for… I mean, drivers will always go for that little last bit in qualifying. So I think it will always be trickier in quali than for the race. I think with these cars we can follow a bit closer in the medium- and high-speed but the tow is obviously worth a little bit less also in the straights. Having said that, I think it will be hugely dependent on whether there's a train of cars with the DRS. In that situation, it will be very, very tricky to overtake. If not, then I think it should be fairly easy. This is very difficult to know. I mean, I don't know exactly what they have under the covers, but they have a very efficient car for sure. Again, we've been normally stronger on high downforce tracks that have been stronger on low downforce tracks. How much of this is coming from the engine or the package? I'm not sure to be honest.",Italy,thursday,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, as you said,  I think we are in a good run now. We found some consistency even though these 10 last races were not completely out of trouble for us. One of those was Barcelona;  we changed the engine, we started last.  One of those was Austria;  the car didn't start on the sprint race and we started last on Sunday so we still need to improve a few things to have completely clean weekends and if we do so probably we will be in the points in the future races I think we are in the same place as we have been all year long. I think we are right behind the top three teams so our natural position, let's say, is seventh, seventh and eighth so we need some help always, from the cars in front.  Sometimes there are penalties involved like in Spa and we start third on the grid. Here there are some other penalties that will come with Carlos and Lewis, I heard, so we could have a better starting position but lately in the race we eventually ended up in our natural (position). Let's see. I think we don't have any specific Monza downforce, let's say, or rear wing so let's see how we can perform here.  The car was very good in Baku and Spa so I don't see any reason why we should not be competitive but I think it's going to come some other races that we will be also fast: maybe Suzuka, Austin so I'm looking forward to all the races,  basically. Yeah, I know the number because every weekend we keep repeating it, but I'm not into this so much. I'm happy to be in Formula 1 for so many years and with the two more coming, or whatever, how long I will be in Formula 1 I will reach 400 for sure so that's a big number. And yeah, it shows my passion for the sport and my discipline to perform at the high level. If you are not performing, the team will not give you 400 Grands Prix  for sure. Yeah, same comments. It's an extra motivation but never a pressure, your performance is not affected by this and if anything they give you extra, so I think it's one of the best moments of the year for sure. At least in my case, I never paid too much attention to rumours so all these things when you are in Ferrari…  When you're in Formula 1 in general you have to perform, if not things will change. It’s the same for drivers, mechanics, designers, bosses.  There's a huge pressure.  This is not a charity event. This is professional sports. I do enjoy it for sure. We would love to fight for the championship or for podiums, there’s always wins but we don't have that possibility yet. But yeah, I'm happy with the performance this year. As I said at the beginning of the year, I think we lost 40-50 good points at the beginning of the year with reliability issues. And with those points, the situation in the championship will be very different, also with McLaren in the fight in the Constructors, so I'm happy and proud with the performance and I think together with 2012, probably they have been my best two seasons, even higher than the championship ones that we have a dominant car on those years. So 2012, 2022, next one will be 2032! Exactly the same, I mean, it’s less than previous years, but it’s still worth a little bit. So it's better not to be the first car, but maybe we are not as stressed as in the past in the last corner, so we should be sure, hopefully. Is that fun? Hopefully. No, I mean, I think it's going to be a great opportunity for him to feel these modern cars, which probably he will be, you know, amazed to feel, and the hybrid power of the engines. And yeah, I met him in the elevator in Zandvoort and he said, ‘I need some tips for next week’, so if I have five minutes, I will take a coffee with him and brief him on whatever he needs to ask. But I think it's going to be straightforward. The cars now are easier to drive in a way. We have more comfort in the car than 15 years ago. The engines they don't need to rev you know, in the last 1000 RPM, now you can drive in any gear out of the corners. So I think it's a bit easier.",Italy,thursday,Alpine
Nicholas Latifi,"The power unit issue in qualifying, yeah we did get on top of it and it wasn't an issue any more in the race. As to the general lack of pace on the weekend still; yeah, some question marks there to be honest. Not a crazy amount of time to go through it in between the two races, obviously.  This weekend is completely different, let's say,  the man from the driver and the car so just kind of looking to focus on this weekend and we have a bigger break after Monza, but before Singapore we'll do a roundup of the past few races. I expect to be very quick in the straight, we saw that in Spa, that was the case. So I think on paper, the car should perform at a higher level here relative to Zandvoort. But at the same time, just being quick in the straight line isn't everything, you still do need to be quick in the corners. In Spa, for example, I think we were quickest in the straight line but then we were also slowest in the second sector which is where all the corners are so it does balance out. The car is quick in the straights because we are lacking downforce so obviously, thankfully, you don't need too much of that around here in Monza so I am hoping that's going to be a relative step forward in performance. But at the same time last year, we were one of the quickest in the straight lines here and we struggled to get out of Q1 with both cars. So again, it's not all about straight line speed, here you do need a car that still gives you the confidence to attack the braking zones and play on the edge with the car in those high speed corners. So it's not all about top speed. I think what we've seen this year is that the tow is worth less than last year, but it's still worth something. I’ve seen that in Spa, we’ve seen that at other tracks. So it's definitely still going to be, I think, an advantage if you can get a good one. As for the way the runs will unfold, I think yeah, Q1 in particular is probably always going to be quite tricky. And yeah, naturally, no one's going to want to be the first car because again, the tow is still worth something. So yeah, I expect it to still be not as straightforward as it is at most other tracks.",Italy,thursday,Williams
Daniel Ricciardo,"I’m going to cover this. This is ridiculous. I have Lando’s face on my neck. Anyway, we did a little thing this morning with a team and gosh, anyway… So I yeah, he looks sunburnt. He's got a few on him as well. So anyway, you'll see later I'm sure. But it is cool, I mean, obviously last year was so special. A big moment. It's a year on, you know, those big moments and memories still seem so much at the forefront of your mind and it feels very recent, everything is still very vivid when I think back on it now. But I think Monza is a place that I've always enjoyed, you know, and results aside, it's a fun track – low downforce, high speed, best pizza in the world, all these all these things that make it fun and nice. And yeah, mum and dad are here this weekend. It's their second race, I think second or maybe third since COVID. So nice to have them here. And yeah, it's good to be back. No, it's still there. Everything's still there. Look, you know, I don't want to say, yeah, we're going to repeat it this year, but obviously just coming into a circuit with those good feelings and good memories and stuff, it's cool. And as I said, like, take the win away, I've always just come to this track and enjoyed my time here. And it's a circuit that I have fun on. I saw they have resurfaced a few corners, but I think the track is still the same. The character of the track is still the same. So looking forward to going out here and getting my teeth stuck in. Don't know. I don't know yet. I mean, look, obviously this year it's hard for me to be like, ‘yeah, we're going to finish on the podium this year’. I would just be saying that to say it. I think we'll be alright. But who knows. So,. to be determined. TBD. I'm really assessing everything. In short, I don't have anything teed up yet. Like, I don't have anything confirmed. And I think when I do, I'll be the first to tell you. There’s no reason for me to hold back any information now. There's no secrets. It's kind of all open and out there. I'm sure over time, the right thing, whatever that ends up being. will make sense. And I think as well, you know, it's not just about what's right for next year, it's what's right for my future, you know. It goes beyond 2023. So it's complex, but when I know you will, We're happy with the decision for sure. Yeah, I agree. Honestly, I just don't want to waste your time. There's not much more to say but I'm happy with it. No comment. Just kidding! The truth is I'm keeping every option open for, as I said, not only next year, but for the future. I still don't know what next year looks like. As Lewis said earlier, I do want to be on the grid, I do want to race. You know, I touched on a few weeks ago that, although this has been like, certainly a challenging time in my career, it hasn't taken the love of the sport away from me and that desire to still be here and still compete. So yeah, obviously many talks or thoughts about next year and beyond that. But as I said, I'm still not sure what that looks like. I asked if I could do less simulator. Just kidding. No, it was clear when all this was decided that anything related to this year, and getting the most out of the rest of the year remains the same. So, if there's any talks about next year's car, then yes, I'm not involved in that. But I also wouldn't expect to be involved in that. But as far as, yeah I'm still simulating, still in all the briefings, the meetings and all the engineering stuff. So yeah, 2022 remained unchanged.",Italy,thursday,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"I think he should be racing, personally. I think he's far too talented to... And he's earned the right to be amongst us all, racing. But of course, if he's a part of our team that would be great. But I mean, the third role is not really, I think, what's best for him. I was managing him, he’d be racing. I mean, it's one of the originals, the classics, the historic circuits. It's the fastest circuit that we have on the calendar. It’s unique in its layout. It’s so much different to all the other circuits that we go to. And then the crowd is incredible here. So, you've got that whole sea of red most often, particularly at the end of the races, but it's great for overtaking and the thrill of driving here, because you're on low downforce and you've kind of floating on the surface of the tyres, is pretty epic. So I'm really grateful for the wins that I've had. I remember my first race here, in 2007 and the pass on Kimi, and, you know, it's not an easy circuit, and it throws lots of spanners in the works. As good as I can feel. Of course, you'd always feel better if you came off a win. But still, we've been making so much progress as a team. We've closed the gap more… At least we’re closing the gap more and more, weekend after weekend. And, of course, we don't know how the car is going to be here this weekend, whether or not it will be as good as it was in the last race, we'll find out. But yeah, I mean, my third engine that I had brand new in Spa is still being worked on, so I can't use it right now, so I have to take a fourth. So that's my doing. And we're still hopeful we can use that later on. But yeah, so I've got to kind of recover the best I can from the back. I don't think it'll be worse. That's a positive way of looking at it. It can't be worse than Spa, I don't think. No, I think it will be a lot better here. Honestly, it had zero importance to me. So it's… I'm grateful that each year, we have had, since 2007, an opportunity to win. I do believe that we're going to have a chance this year, still got some races to go. And that's definitely a real big goal for us as a team, to get back to the front and be fighting for the lead., I've not really thought of where our car… I have no idea where our car is going to be great. So, you know, it was a surprise when we got in the car last week, and the car felt so much better than it… like completely different to the previous weekend. But I'm hoping more often than not, it feels like Budapest and the last race for the rest of the races. I'm not focused on the record but of course, I'm trying to get that win this year. But the record is not important to me. Just because I don't really care about records in general, so… I think at least second. We obviously got…  we had good pace; we were closing on our on our one-stop strategy. We were obviously really unfortunate with the VSC. And that seems to have happened a lot this year. Basically, when you're doing slow laps, you're in one strategy, and when you go to start lap, you're in a different strategy and I was slightly late to it, but it wouldn't have made a difference. They’ve calculated the distance. I was into it, on the bank on the straight and either way he was coming past, so… Well, I mean, it's not an easy role for anyone, I think it takes time to get into a role and, and build all the relationships, and again, also to implement change. But I think the most important thing for right now is the drivers. We're trying to build that connection with the drivers, all of us, the GPDA, we're all united, and we want to help make the racing better. We want to help the FIA, and Mohammed has been really open with that. So yep, we're just going to continue to work on that communication. I'm in touch with him quite a lot. We actually speak quite a bit. And, and he's very, very driven for… he's competitive. He used to race himself, so he has a competitor sort-of mindset. And he's also very keen on diversity, and really pushing for future change. So he wants to collaborate with us all on that. So I'm quite happy with it I mean, it's always complicated. But I would say… look, we've been very strong in the past, we've won world titles, our communication continues to improve. We're holding more meetings, and breakout group conversations about…  and I'm trying to just help give as much feedback as I can about what I'm feeling in the car and what are those limitations where I could gain time. These will be things that they won't be able to see in the data, that the driver is able to bring to it. So, working closely with George also on that. But there is potential in the cars: We've got downforce, it's just in some places it we're not able to utilise it. And ride quality, of course, is an area that we can always be better. So I'm comfortable the direction that we're going and have 1,000% confidence in the guys back at the factory, who are stringing together all these pieces of the puzzle, and have no doubt that we will be back in a fighting position next year. The drag? I can't answer that. Honestly. I think that's more for the aero… I'm not an aerodynamicist. As I said, we do tend to have a bit of a draggy car, I think, this year. I can't really answer much more to it. I'm always asking the question and I think we're all trying to understand it. And yeah, try to make sure we rectify that for next year. Do I have the same feeling? Oh, for sure, it's a challenge. For me, it's just winning another World Championship. It's like, every one, I've approached it as my first, and the feeling of winning the World Championship, it's so unique and special in its own way. But of course, the idea that no driver in history has ever gone past seven, of course, you want to try and accomplish that. But what I guess, as you get older, you realise the journey is the most important part and the ride that you do with all the people and all the people that you bring with you, and all the people that you try to elevate… there's an opportunity to elevate lots of people, not only in your team, but with the work that we're doing, with Mission 44, there's a much bigger picture to it. But from a personal point of view, yeah, winning another world title continues to be a goal. I'll be so proud to be able to do that for this team. So, I mean, look, for years, we'll be going around, up and down with stories of retirement and stopping and for me, I feel healthier than I've ever felt, as I focus a lot on that, I'm feeling fit. I love what I'm doing – and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon – sorry Buddy – but I'm very… my goal was always to be with Mercedes, y’know, I signed with them in 1997. I love that we have the long partnership we have, I feel like we are embarking on a lot of really positive things, not only in the sport, but outside. And I think there's a lot of work, a lot to accomplish together. So I want to be a part of that. I think I'll always be with Mercedes ‘til the day I die. And I feel like I can race for quite a bit longer. So, I'll be potentially steering towards that.",Italy,thursday,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was very impressive. Once we jumped on the sailboat, it was super, super impressive to see how they're able to jump side by side. It was really, really enjoyable and a great experience and a lot of respect for what they do. You know, looking from the outside, you don't tend to think that they're that impressive. Yeah, certainly, in terms of learning on the wind, understanding directions on how to optimise your power, your energies, when to put the energies into it, when to push, when not to. So, I think there's definitely a lot of similarities with our sports. It's a great podium to be in, you know, the tifosi really may make it very special. So being on the podium here, it's certainly one of the most special ones in the whole calendar. So yeah, it will be really nice to get there this weekend. I will hope that we have the similar pace to what we have shown in Spa, that will be good. But certainly, I believe that this track, it’s a little bit different to Belgium, certainly the weather will be, so it will be interesting to see how we are able to perform. For example, Mercedes was very strong last weekend, especially with the tyre deg, so yeah, it will be an interesting one this Sunday. Yeah, because we were sitting really, really low. Lower than any anyone out there! And also, I think we got quite an efficient car in that regard. We’ve seen in Spa, and hopefully again in Monza, that we tend to like more the lower downforce wings. So the car seems to perform better when we run with the smaller rear wing. So hopefully, that can be a good thing again, here,. But, as I say, it's going to be very different conditions. So, we are also very curious to see how we are able to cope on these different conditions. Yeah, I think it took a bit too many incidents to remove them. Already a few years ago, we saw how dangerous they can be. But I mean, luckily, nothing bad has happened. But again, it's a great thing to get rid of them, because they can create a massive shunt.",Italy,thursday,Red Bull
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I mean, there's several issues, of course after summer break it’s been extremely tough for the team, so yes, Spa we were having both cars taking the engine penalties. So obviously, we're were in with little chance for the race. But then yeah, last weekend, it was let's say probably the biggest struggle race, so far this season, in terms of this couldn't get the tyres to be working in the range. And it was very tight in Zandvoort, of course: two cars, of course, barely made it into Q2, but overall, we were finding more and more pace. Hopefully… it wasn't so bad in Spa in the low downforce track, so in Monza is again, a very important race for us, like a home race for the team, and hopefully better speed. Yeah, I mean points is of course, still there and as you know, as we saw, especially in tracks like here: low downforce, a lot of overtaking opportunities hopefully, so provides quite a lot of chances. And, yeah, it's quite true to say that we're not having the advantage we had earlier of the season, where I think we was very good on the weight, saving a lot of that, and now people are catching up, and we're being maybe not as fast as others, in terms of reductions. But we're still there, like last weekend, we saw on-tenth could be up to three positions or more. So, in that midfield battle, it’s all about putting everything together in the in the car. Yeah, we're talking about it. And there's no hurry, myself and the team are very happy for each other, the job we've done so far. It wasn't an easy season, let's say, for the rookie campaign. But for my side, I'm quite happy working with everyone in the team. And yeah, we're talking about it. Nothing has been confirmed but hopefully I get more information soon, and I get it all done. So now, I’m just focused on delivering a great race and hopefully get the team back in the points. All right. Best Yeah, to be honest, I was quite surprised at the beginning of the year, because obviously, being in Formula 1 for the first year, and to see how much power the driver actually can affect – which I think is very positive things to take – because most of us are agreed into the same thing, depends on what tracks and what needs to be changing. So of course, the Race Director, under fire, trying their best to even do the change, for example: I think in thing Miami or something,  just over the night. So, it was great to see that. Of course, the sausage kerbs is making racing quite difficult when you're racing side-by-side, not just for us also for the feeder series, you know, there's been a few incidents in Monza in the past, so I think it’s definitely a good way to go.",Italy,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, unfortunately, it was harder than expected. I mean, we got a good start, a good restart after a Safety Car, but the pace was just not there. We had a lot of overheating on the tyres. We were sliding around a lot and yeah, for some reason our package wasn't quite there this weekend, but in the end we finished on a podium and yeah, we will take it. No. The first two laps were strong, but then we immediately went into high degradation and then I realised that that we were degrading more than what we should. Red Bull, Max and Checo, they were a league of their own today and unfortunately we couldn't put a stronger fight and we had to survive. We will have to learn why at this track we were not so competitive. Yeah, Zandvoort should be a better track for us. Monza should be advantage Red Bull there. But we will try and win it in Zandvoort. No, I don't think… I think we left nothing on the table today. We were just not strong enough compared to them. They were on another planet this weekend. They were just strong in Quali, strong in the race, better in tyre management, stronger on the straights, stronger in the corners – some of them. And we were just not quick enough, unfortunately, this weekend.  After the strong start that I got, the strong restart of the Safety Car, the gap that I had after the first couple of laps, I felt that I was on for a good opportunity. But very quickly, I realised that I went into overheating with a tyres. I was sliding around a lot and it was not going to happen. Yes, a bit. I think we would lie, if we wouldn't say that. We are surprised because the gap was certainly much bigger, or the biggest we've seen all season across the two teams. And it's certainly something that we didn't expect. Which means we need to go back and analyse why, at this sort of track, we are so weak. And, yeah, we still need to analyse, take some conclusions and try to come up with a better low downforce package for Monza in case we are not so strong there also. I was hopeful that the six-to-eight tenths that we saw in Quali were going to come down in the race with a hotter track. It was maybe more being optimistic and hopeful about my prospects for the race. But unfortunately, if anything, it made the gap even bigger, and we were just sliding even more. We had even less grip and we went backwards more quickly than I expected, no? But yeah, as I said, we need to take P3 because this weekend, there was not much more to do, and we saved a decent result. No, it was marginal, especially at some point when he boxed with a three or four-lap fresher tyre, which around here is a big delta. On pace, I thought it was going to get very tight at the end but I did a good job at the beginning of the Hard stint to manage the tyre, to have some tyre left for the last five laps, and push. And actually, I managed to match, I think it was Checo’s and George’s pace at the end. It was a struggle, the whole race with the tyres with the pace – but as I said, I don't think there was much more in it. Honestly, nothing. I think it’s a consequence of truck characteristics and our package is not suiting this, this kind of track. We will see after Zandvoort. I think we need to go to Zandvoort, a high downforce track and see how we perform to take any conclusions but my feeling - and it's just a feeling - is that we had a bit of an off weekend here with the way maybe the car was performing and the ratio of efficiency around here.  And Red Bull had a great weekend, no, and  this makes the gap particularly big and I need to wait and see a few more races to analyse that. Same. I think it’s one of the best tracks in the calendar.  I think they've also done a very good job with the changes they've done on track. I think putting gravel, getting rid of some tarmac run-offs,  making Eau Rouge safer, I think it's all changes that are in the right direction and I think we need to congratulate the circuit for that. And it makes it for a better show, and we look forward to come back in the future and hopefully it can stay in the calendar long. We certainly need to take conclusions from this weekend and analyse why the lower downforce package was not as strong as the lower downforce package of Red Bull. I think it's also an inherent characteristic of each car. I think clearly in high downforce tracks we've been performing better than at the lower ones and it's a tendency that we've seen all year so I wouldn't be surprised if Red Bull is a bit quicker in Monza, but we certainly want to be a lot closer and put on a fight, no, like it's been in every track so far this year. Even Baku was where there was lower downforce, we've managed to outqualify them and be ahead in the race until we faced some issues so I think we can learn from this weekend.  We have two weeks to analyse with the Zandvoort weekend in between where I'm hopeful that our package will be performing a lot better.",Belgium,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I really hoped for more. Today was a good opportunity but Max was just flying. He was on another planet and he was untouchable. Especially the first stint was quite poor in terms of degradation, but still it’s a very strong result for the team and I think we managed to get a lot of points today, which is important. Yeah, looking forward. Yeah, there was a bit of chaos on lap one. I had a really poor start and I lost a few positions. I managed to get them all back in Turn 5. Yeah, it was very hectic that lap one and a lot of contacts. Yeah, it didn't start well, today. It was a very bad start, losing a lot of places. Luckily I managed to stay out of trouble and managed to get George by Turn 5. And then there was a this incident between Fernando and Lewis, so back to P2. Then the Safety Car, so it brought us back into our original position. And yeah, I couldn't get soon enough through Carlos. I was managing the tyre, starting on the Medium, it was probably a bit harder than expected on the deg, on the initial pace. And then from then on… Still, it's a great team result. Yeah. I think there was something with the clutch. As soon as I dropped, I just went straight into wheelspin and here it's very penalising, the tarmac is really rough at the start. I think normally here if you get a bad start it's probably one of the worst places to get it because the tarmac is so rough at the start. Yeah, well, I think they got the car was certainly the fastest today. And especially Max was very impressive. The whole weekend, especially come the race, he was just on another level today. So that's great, great to have, you know, but I think it's very track specific. I think when we are back to Zandvoort we will have the Ferraris and Mercedes back into contention. I was focused on getting George! And yeah, once I got by, then I saw, I think, Lewis in the air. And I was just focused, again, not to get hit by Fernando who was coming back on track. So yeah, to be honest, difficult to read it. Well, certainly the car has become quicker from the beginning of the season. But yeah, certainly I'm not as comfortable as I was in the beginning of the season. So, it's something that I need to work on, on my side to make sure we are able to get the maximum out of the car. Because sometimes you are… things become more natural for you to get the most out of your car. And sometimes you have to work really hard and go very deep in the analysis, to make sure you are able to extract the maximum. So, it seems that we are in that window at the moment. And I really hope that from this weekend, we run the cars slightly different, so we are able to spot some differences that can come bring some performance on our site. Yeah, there’s still eight races to go, so anything can really happen. We will try to maximise. It's very important for us, the Constructors’ as well. So, I think, right now yeah, we are in a great position, but things can change fairly quickly. So, as a team, we want to maximise everything we possibly can, every weekend. Yeah, I wish to think differently but I think it was not for the drivers that they've kept the place in the calendar so it's great to have to have Spa, I think. It's a unique place that we all enjoy coming.  The fans, the pure fans really enjoy coming here.",Belgium,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"I was a quite a hectic first lap to try and stay out of trouble. So many things were happening in front of me. But once we settled in after the Safety Car, the car was really on rails. Picked the right places to pass people and we could look after our tyres. That's how we made our way forward. And after that, once were in the lead, it was all about managing everything. But this whole weekend has been incredible. Of course. It's been a weekend I couldn't imagine before. But I think we want more of them. So we keep on working hard. Yeah, let's see what we can do there. I mean, of course I'm going to enjoy today and then we'll see next week where we can do. I think if you look at the whole weekend, yes. The car has been incredible from FP1. I don't think we expected it to be like this. But you know, sometimes it's nice when things positively surprise you. And yeah, it's been really enjoyable to drive the car around here this year. And yeah, of course, we knew we had our difficulties for the race when you start P14. But yeah, we stayed out of trouble on lap one, which wasn't easy. It was very hectic in front of me. But once everything calmed down with the Safety Car, it was literally just overtaking one car every lap. And once I was back into P3, and I saw that my tyres were actually holding on quite nicely with the Soft compound, I knew that there was a good possibility we could win the race. I think our car is very efficient. And then this track I think suits it perfectly, maybe. So I know that some tracks which are coming up might be a little bit more difficult and I expect again a good battle with Ferrari, it was just that yeah, this track seemed to be perfect for the car. To be honest, I didn't even think about it yesterday. I just wanted to have a good race and I knew that as soon as I was out of trouble after lap one that we could have a good race. But I never really think about what lap I'm going to lead because it's impossible to imagine. Yeah, I don't expect it to be like this. Just because of the track layout, more downforce on the car to get round, less straights as well. So definitely will be closer than here. The first lap… you know, the thing is that I knew, of course, with the car we had, you don't want to risk too much. So, then it's even harder to stay out of trouble. And people were going off in the gravel, coming back on the track. And of course, they are defending their sport. And yeah, I was literally just trying to stay out of it. But you also don't want to lose too much time. But yeah, then of course with Lewis driving there… well I don't know the car was broken, I think he was holding up everything. And then everyone of course tries to benefit from that. So then people are going too wide and I went on the inside, but then of course Lewis pulled off, which is correct to do but then I had to move to the left. It was super-hectic, and so much dirt as well, like I pulled off my tear-off because I barely could see anything just because of the previous sector, like everyone just going on the grass, on the gravel, but we survived without damage. It’s not only today, I think I'm always good on tyres. Maybe people don't look at it. But yeah, just understanding, experience, trying to set up the car in the best way possible. And sometimes the car reacts better to it and sometimes not. I think when you look at, for example, Austria, we weren't that great, but I think we learned from that. And we tried to apply that. Yeah, if the car sometimes is that good, everything becomes easier. I think every year you gain experience – but I think you cannot compare years. The cars are completely different, to drive, to race. So yeah, I do think also at this stage of the year, we are a lot more competitive than we were last year. So then naturally, I think that helps a lot in terms of getting the race wins. You know, last year I think around this time, Mercedes was stronger. Of course, we still had a few wins around this time, but I think they were not always on pure pace of the car we had, but as a team we always executed things well. And, like I said you cannot compare the years. To be honest, I already prepared Zandvoort. I am of course enjoying today but then I go home and I don't really think about F1 too much. And then I jump on the plane on Thursday morning, I think, and then I'll think about Zandvoort, and then I'll drive Zandvoort and try to do the best I can.  But yeah, for the moment, I did all my work already to prepare in the best way possible on the simulator, what we think is right and everything felt quite decent. But again, we put the car on the track on Friday and we'll find out. I hope it influenced it but yeah, it's my favourite track on the calendar. It's amazing, especially when the car’s really hooked up like yesterday in qualifying, it was really enjoyable to drive. So yeah, from my side, I hope of course we will never stop coming here but of course, at the end of the day, it's not up to me, but I'm very happy that it's here and  that it’s happening next year. Well, I think in general, it's just nice to win. I think it's then of course even nicer and the way we won it,  and it's even better to win it on a track like Spa which is my favourite track. And yeah, I haven't, of course, driven it a lot in the past, but I've been a lot around the go kart track and around. And it's not far away from where I grew up so yeah, it's nice to be here and also to bring family members to the track and stuff throughout the weekend. It's always nice that everyone can be involved so I'm of course very happy with this weekend. Yeah, after the safety car restart I would say.  The first bit was just too hectic and especially when you… like I said before, with the car we had you don't want to get damage or whatever because that will be really painful. But then yeah, it was it was nice, I really enjoyed it, passing cars of course, some of them are quite a lot slower than us so it was quite easy to get them but you still need to get them as quickly as possible. So that was definitely the nice part of it. And then of course when you get to the lead about just trying to manage your tyres in the best way possible, you know, being focused on that. I won’t be around. I don't see myself driving until I'm 40, in Formula 1 at least. I want to also do other things. But I still have a few more years in Formula 1 for sure. Yeah, well, Carlos told me it was a tear-off. I didn't know. I hope it's not mine. But there was a lot of stuff,  honestly people… they were all pulling stuff out and it's just super unlucky, to be honest, that that happens. You're always scared that it happens, especially when you’re in the pack because… especially on a track like this, you are taking them off very quickly, that is your worst nightmare, that these things happen but yeah, unfortunately they do happen.",Belgium,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was an amazing qualifying but I think already the whole weekend we've been on it. The car has been working really well and just basically trying to fine tune it and it all came together in qualifying. Of course, I had to be a bit careful with the amount of tyres I was using. Also looking for tomorrow, you know, starting in the back, but yeah, very happy with my lap and it's great to be here. It's an amazing track, amazing fans around and yeah, I hope you had a good day. We need to move forward. I think especially with a car like this, it would be a shame not to be on the podium. Yeah, car was good all weekend. And that's, of course, very nice start like that. Of course, you're making changes to the car, even before qualifying, and I think they worked even better. Very pleased. Of course, you never know what the margin is going to be but the feeling in the car was very good all weekend. Straights… corners! It's been good! It felt really good in the car. I mean, it depends also bit on the track layout. You know, sometimes it's a bit easier to nail a lap than other tracks where, if you have a tiny lock-up big, big lap-time losses and stuff. But yeah, I would say it's definitely one of the best ones. Well, I think with the pace we have in the car, I want to move forward and I want to be at least on the podium. Yeah, survive, of course, lap one, that's the most important, but then after that I need to pass a few cars, before, of course, you get into a competitive position. But it's a bit like Hungary as well. Of course, it's a bit further back now but the basics are the same. Yeah, you don't want to hit that. It's not a rally car we are in so you have to stay off that. I think so. You could see already in the F3 race that normally in the old spec of the track, people would just run wide and then come back because it lets you. Of course now you can't so now everyone will be a bit more cautious.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"It was OK. I mean, happy to be starting on pole, obviously not so happy to see the gap to Max this weekend and the gap that Red Bull has on us. We need to see why Red Bull is so fast around this track and why we are trailing them but to start from pole is a good place to start and we will try and win from there tomorrow. Yeah, my Q3, run one was cleaner. The out lap was a bit of a mess, playing with the tow, seeing who wanted to lead and in the end I had to lead and I had no tow and I had to take the lead there. But in the end it was a bit of a mess and the first lap was good enough for P2, which I knew was going to give me the pole. But yeah, still a big puzzle, you know, to see this big gap to Max and to see the big gap to Red Bull, which makes me wonder what's going to happen tomorrow in the race because I think our race pace is a bit better than our quali pace but there's definitely something to find. In terms of overall feeling it was okay. We don't have any big balance issues. Of course, the whole weekend, we just have a pace deficit to Red Bull and Max. It's a bit puzzling because we we've been on the pace all year. You know, we've been fighting for pole all year, but for some reason at this track, this weekend, I don't know if it's temperatures, the efficiency of their car or whatever it is putting them with a healthy – very healthy – margin ahead that is making our life a bit more difficult. But even like that, we executed a good Quali as a team and we managed to put ourselves on pole for tomorrow and we will try and win from there. Not much quicker. Already Q3 run one was a pretty clean lap. Obviously, with a tow from Charles, I missed a bit my braking into Turn 5-6-7 and lost a bit there. But there was no more than a tenth in it. So, when you see the gap to Max, it makes you wonder where that… how much was it, I don’t even know, seven-tenths or eight-tenths? It has been there all weekend because FP3, FP2, he was just always more than half a second ahead of us in every compound, in every situation. So, some homework to do there. And if not, I do believe that in race trim, we can be a bit more competitive. Not entirely, no – especially with the pace Max has. I think, as soon as there's either a Safety Car that can help him close the gap, or even with the pace that he has, that if you translate it into 44 laps, it’s… he can come back, and we've seen him do it before. I mean, that will not be my focus, obviously, the first and second stint it will be a straight battle with with Checo and the Mercedes, if they have the race pace, and we will try and pull away for sure but I wouldn't discard the two guys at the back making it through. Yeah, I think so, yeah. If I would have done his lap that he did today I would be also confident that I…  and that as soon as something happens at the front, or there’s a safety car to close the gap that he can make it.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, certainly. I mean, P2 is not the worst place to be around here. I think if I'm able to get a good run to Carlos then it can be different I can be on the other side of the road, so looking forward for tomorrow, I think there will be a great race ahead of us. Yeah, it will be very important, you know, to get a good start and try to do our own race from the beginning and I think that will be the key for tomorrow. Yeah, it was going well. Q3 wasn't as straightforward. On my first lap, I ended up being the lead car, basically, and without any circulation around here you can lose a bit. Still, the lap wasn't very, very clean so there was more to come and then on my second lap we ran out of time. There was a lot of traffic ahead.  Yeah, I just ended up too close to the cars ahead and I had no grip so I ended up going straight into turn five. Yeah, we definitely have at least a good idea on where to put the car for tomorrow. It was very useful, the long run with it today, we learnt a lot. And hopefully tomorrow we are able to translate that into race pace. Yeah, I think certainly you don't want to be leading into Eau Rouge if there's a car behind, really close by. But yeah, hopefully we can make the most out of it, get a good start and get the lead from Carlos early on. No, definitely I think there is a good opportunity for tomorrow, starting P2, especially around here, around this place it's always a great opportunity. And so I will go for it. I really hope very early on, I'm able to do my own race,  that will be key for my hopes tomorrow.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, mine was pretty simple to be honest. Went straight back to work for some magazines for the Chinese people, because I didn't really have time to do that. And then some shootings the first week and then actually I stayed in UK because my family actually flew in the Silverstone weekend, the first time the whole family was here and we stayed put pretty much all the time in UK. And actually, I went you to the beach in UK because it was very nice and sunny there, 30 degrees. Yeah, we had fun with the family and now obviously back to work. To be honest, I think it was better than I expected in terms of the speed.  We were able to reach reasonably quick up to the speed also matching or catching up the gap with Valtteri from beginning of the year first race to now onwards and it's been good in that. And obviously, there's weakness I have to improve and also, I feel like the first half are being quite extremely unlucky in some cases with quite a lot of  DNFs. I think the most DNF on the grid. So I feel like we deserve more points so hopefully everything will be reasonably much smoother for the coming races. And yeah, we'll be working together with the start. I think it's quite clear for our team,  struggling first lap and to get that fixed and should be having more opportunity fighting with opponents.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Fernando Alonso,"Well, yeah, it was for two or three days, then  it changed, there was more news coming. But yeah, I had this possibility, the phone call from Aston after Sebastian announced that he was stopping at the end of the year. So yeah, at that point we sit down and we go to this agreement. I think the project is very attractive. Obviously there is a lot of investment going on in the last few years, a lot of new people came to the team, very talented engineers, designers, new facilities in Silverstone. So… I don't know, I felt that it was a nice project for the future. They were extremely happy to join forces and to have this possibility to grow up together. We felt that it was the right thing to do. Let's see. I think for sure there are some risks on every decision you make in Formula 1. No one has the crystal ball to guess the future. At the same time in Formula 1 or in any sport, you win or you don't. Doesn't matter to be fourth or ninth or 13th.  You are first or you are not winning. And I think… all the Formula 1 teams and drivers we are here to be in that top spot and yeah, I felt that within the possibilities that I had on the table for next year, I think this one was the right one and as I said, the project has some ingredients for the future that in Formula 1 normally are synonymous of success: when you invest and you have the best people so let's see if we can shortcut that time as much as possible and make Aston Martin very fast, next year already, I hope to keep this consistency; as you said eight consecutive times in the points. Some of them could have been even better. I remember in Austria, for example, in the sprint race, the car didn't start on the sprint race, I had to start last. Barcelona: we changed the engine, we started last. So even with those difficulties, we kept scoring points. So yeah, I hope to have a good weekend here, a clean weekend. The car is strong now. We've been improving a lot in the last few months and yeah, I hope top five or top six is possible here. And also I talked  with my engineers, mechanics and these remaining nine races, we want to finish on a high and a podium will be a dream for us and who knows when that possibility will come? Hopefully this weekend will be the first one. Yeah, well, you ask too many details, which then is up to us to disclose everything. But yeah, I have no problems to say that everything started when Sebastian announced the retirement. I think Aston was waiting for that decision. They were happy with Sebastian to continue one more year. At the end, Seb decided to stop and they started calling some drivers that they were interested in. I was one of those and I was still available and yeah, we started talking on that weekend, briefly, about the conditions that I was expecting, about what they were expecting from me as well. Yeah, we meet quite quickly on our expectations and fulfil all our wishes. And yeah, on Monday morning we signed and we decided to announce it quite quickly before any leaks. And yeah, that's more or less the timeline of everything. Yeah, yeah, that was my intention and I was not hiding that as well. Every press conference that I did so far this year, I was quite clear that I was happy with the progress that we're making as a team. It has been an incredible journey for me to come back into the sport with Alpine which I consider my team, my family. We won so many things together and that will be part of our history, not only the Renault Group history, but also Fernando history, what we do together and I was happy but yeah, for one reason or another, we were not moving forward from a couple of months already and yeah, it seems that it was a logical move to me because Aston was very willing to have me and trust on my abilities on the track and off track as well, to develop the project. And, in my case also, it felt that after all the negotiations and the months, having the seat available for a younger driver and talented driver like Oscar, it was the right thing to do and a win-win situation seemed for everybody. You never know. It was not that a specific talk about the future with them, and we were moving around in different things and we were not maybe agreeing on the principles. And it's not only what you agree in terms of the duration of the contract, it’s just also the trust that you feel and how you feel wanted in a place, you know, and if it was just a temporary thing or is just facts and a time watch that they are happy with. And it was always a strange feeling and yeah, as I said, I felt we felt that it was the right decision to move to Aston because they seemed to really want me and appreciate every performance that I was put in the last two years. Yeah, I'm happy with this question because, yeah, it's true, Otmar probably didn't know anything but I informed Laurent Rossi, president Luca De Meo, my mechanics, my engineers before any announcement, so all the people that were involved in the negotiations, they had been informed before any announcement on Aston Martin. Omar was not involved in the negotiations and yes, probably Laurent or Luca didn't call him before the announcement and he was surprised by that. But yeah, all the people that I've been negotiating with, they were informed before any announcement and about my move to Aston and as I said, even my mechanics and my engineers, I took my time to inform them before any announcement. It’s difficult to comment.  Obviously, like every one that is seated here probably we were surprised and I was but I think it's not up to me to comment on this and more to the team because I don't know exactly how is the situation but I think everyone was surprised. No, not at all. And I read that in the first days. And honestly, it was by quite sad, and annoying to read that, you know, conspiracy, because, I mean, I make this decision, I explain why. Because, you know, from some months that I've been chatting with the team about extending the contract, that nothing officially arrive, and nothing officially happened and Aston called me after Sebastian retired. If Sebastian probably continue, this will not happen, they move to Aston. So, I mean, they were very clear and very easy decisions from my side. And what happened after and what is happening, as I said, with Oscar, whatever, is completely, you know, not my thing. I will be completely aside. Oscar is an incredible talent for any team and for Alpine. I've been working with him for now two years and I wish him the best, and also the best for Alpine, because it’s going to be my team this year but they’re going to be my team always on my heart, as I said before, because we achieved things that were unthinkable when we started the relationship, and I went back to the sport also thanks to Alpine, so I only wish the best for them. And those comments that I read, they were sad to read. Bar of any of these negotiations, you know, I've been doing my things always and Flavio’s coming to some races, but as you may know, with other deals that he has with Stefano and Formula 1 and Paddock Club and things, but not related to me. Yeah, I agree with Lewis. We have more access to everything now, compared to the past. I think we always follow Formula 1, and even when we were kids, and we were racing in go-karts, we still you know watching television and Ayrton Senna and all our idols. But it was very difficult to get more info about Formula 1, you just had to have the right country to watch Formula 1. In Spain, for example, we didn't have any coverage. So we have to find RTL or some satellite to follow Formula 1. There were not social media so you were not updated on anything that happened. And there were not activations by the team, the sponsors, the promoter now with Liberty Media, the great job that Stefano is doing. So, I mean, everyone can more-or-less follow Formula 1 now because there is a lot of access and is much more open. So, this is bringing more and more fans into the sport and this is very welcome.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"Yes, And I needed it. The first part of the season has been full of highs or lows so loads of emotions and there's lots of accumulation of emotions which leads to being tired so I was quite happy to go on holidays and I use these three weeks in the best way possible with my family, my friends. And yeah, it was just great. Well, I think we'll take it one by one as a team. But for sure we need to try and maximise every opportunity that we have ahead and I still believe in the championship of course.  It's going to be a very difficult challenge but I will believe in it until the very end. Yeah, well, we just need to do that. It's maybe easier to say than to do it but I'll give my best. It is a very special truck for me obviously. I think for every driver the first victories is very special. I got it here in very strange conditions obviously, with what happened on the Saturday with Anthoine but it's a track I really enjoy driving all the time and hopefully, more of a great result this weekend. The picture was actually something we did in 2019 that we couldn't do in 2020 and 2021, because of Covid reasons, but it's something that we just do with absolutely all the factory, all the people involved with the Formula 1 department, which is very nice, because you can finally see faces and speak with them directly. And thank them also for all the support they've given us, and the work they've done in 2020 and 2021 while we're going through these tough times with the performance of the car, and now we are fighting for wins again. But speaking about Hungary, obviously, we looked at it. And yeah, we'll grow from that as a team, I'm sure. And again, in 2020 and 2021, we’ve been working very unified as a team. And I think that helped us to be at the level where we are at in terms of performance today. And this is exactly the same thing that we are trying to do now to get better. Well, I think it's, it's whoever puts it a perfect weekend together because in between Red Bull and ourselves there's very little: maybe sometimes we're a tiny bit stronger, sometimes they are a tiny bit stronger. Now there's also Mercedes that is coming into the fight, which is nice, but at the end, I think the one that wins eventually is the one that just puts a great weekend together. And yeah, so that will define the differences between the two teams, I think Well, I mean, I can only speak personally. I think it was in 2020 when I renewed for that long-term contract. In my situation, it was a dream. I mean, I've always dreamed of being with Ferrari. And yeah, it was an amazing opportunity and obviously, I signed it straight away and I'm very happy that I've taken that choice. And I believe also, from the team's point of view, I think it's good to have a long term vision on what you are doing with the team, the development, there's no rush. I mean, obviously, there's a rush to try and bring the pieces as early as possible, the parts as early as possible. But on the other hand, you also have that long-term vision where you know, you're going to work with the team in one year or two, and that whatever you are working on with the team, you will also be able to experience it. And yeah, I think that was very beneficial for myself and also the team.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Ferrari
Kevin Magnussen,"Well, yeah, I had an opportunity to go on one of the SailGP boats, which was a really cool experience with the Danish team, I got to meet the sailors there.  I'm a passionate sailor myself so going on one of these boats is almost like the… that and the America's Cup is the top in terms of sailing so yeah, they're much like Formula 1 cars on the water so I really enjoyed it. We put the upgrade on and could see that the numbers we were getting on track were correlating to wind tunnel and that's like the first bucks you want to take and then of course, there's some work to do to get it to perform at its maximum and get the full potential out of it. But at least, sometimes and in the past with the team, we've put upgrades on and we've taken a step back and have had a tough time with it so it was nice to see that at least it was correlating and then we didn't take a step back. It was kind of maybe not so much better right in Hungary but there's potential. The good thing is I know Dom, my new  race engineer, I know him quite well, because he was Romain’s race engineer during our time, so I haven’t worked directly with him, but kind of, you know, know him very well. And he kind of knows me, too so it's going to be a pretty smooth transition, I think. So I'm looking forward to that and yeah, the rest of the year.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Haas
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, good afternoon everyone. It's nice to see everybody. We’ve definitely… I'm pretty sure all of us have missed being at the race circuit. This year… when I started this year, I'm quite bad at some planning things, I'm always very last minute and one of my New Year's resolutions was to plan ahead. So, for the for the August break, I already planned it in February and it's the place that I have… it’s the continent that I've wanted to go and visit. Whilst I've been there before, it's the place I wanted to go more than anywhere. And I got to obviously travel in lots of different places.  It was incredible how welcoming everyone was and it was a very grounding experience to see the incredible landscape and the different countries that we went to. And it was a very humbling experience just seeing people live with literally nothing. Just in like a house made of sticks, you know, literally twigs, and no shoes, no socks, and going about their daily lives, you know, not with social media, and not with the stuff that we all we all have in the Western world and then it didn’t seem like they took anything for granted which was really quite beautiful to see. I do,  definitely, I think. Of course we've been improving, we've had this consistency that's come up of the recent races and great progress that the team was just making, everyone pulling together, continuing to push. And the car is becoming more of a racing car which is not particularly what it was the beginning of the year, more like a normal racing car in the sense of its characteristics so that's positive. And the last race was obviously the best showing that we've had so far. And that, for us, was a huge boost of just that we can close that gap. So it's naturally going to continue to be tough, we will keep our heads down. The other guys are doing an amazing job but I do believe that we can close the gap. I think there's still plenty to achieve here personally, maybe not like that many records as such, but still a lot of ground to cover with the team. And like the guys here I still deeply in love with the sport and particularly like the direction and things that we're doing within the sport, the work that conversations that I get to have with Stefano. But of course, there's lots more outside that's continuing to grow as well. So it’s exciting times I think. The future’s bright, I like to think. I mean, the business is growing. So yes, it is good for the sport. I think it's down to the great work that that Liberty is doing with the sport. The access, of course we know that Netflix has had a big effect but social media as well, I think the young youth is on TikTok, all that sort of stuff. So just a lot more eyeballs are on it. Kids love cars and it is the coolest sport there is. So, it was only a matter of time, at some point that it was going to go this direction. And I think it's great. I see fans from all ages that come and visit me, or send me letters from literally just from babies and their little baby Mercedes outfits to, you know, to five-year olds to 106 year olds. There's a still a good older generation that's still super in love with the sport. Obviously they watched it their whole lives. And so yeah, I think it's awesome. Just from my personal experience, I think there's pros and cons always in all different scenarios. I remember when I signed at McLaren, I signed a loan deal. And I think that was good at the time. When you do short deals… it takes time to bond with a team, it takes time to build relationships, it's not something that you can do in half a year or a year. I’m incredibly grateful for my journey with my team because we're still continuously improving and growing closer and, and starting to actually create some change. But to each their own, whatever works. I look down, and see what other drivers are doing. It doesn't matter what I think, whether I think it's right or wrong, it's what they feel is right. And at the end of the day, just the opportunity to re-sign with the team is an amazing scenario. It's really unfortunate for Daniel, but I really, really hope that… I still think he has he deserves a place here in the sport. So I really hope there's somewhere great for him, because he's still got lots to achieve.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Mercedes
Daniel Ricciardo,"Yeah, obviously, it's not, the result we wanted, in terms of when I joined the team. The outcome, this wasn’t desired. As a collective though, we just didn’t really get it right. We put in a lot of effort and tried to understand, things with the car and obviously myself gelling with it and getting the maximum out of it, but there was just too many weekends, where it was obviously just a bit of a struggle. So that was pretty much how that kind of decision came about. Well, it's obviously not the nicest feeling, but I can hold my head high in terms of applying myself and trying to make it work, like trying to put everything in. Sometimes you just have to accept that, okay, I try it and it didn't necessarily work out. But, from that point of view, I don't look back in terms of ‘man, I was slacking off, and that's why, like, I earned this’,  or whatever. It’s just one of those things. I'm proud of the way we tried to make it happen and persist through it, but some things maybe you just say that they're not meant to be. I still love the sport and I think through all of this – I guess call it adversity – I haven't lost that confidence in myself. For sure, we've had some tough weekends and you can't help but show emotion sometimes but I still love it and I still want to do it competitively. I want to do it in the right place. I never said I want to just be a driver to make up the numbers. You know, if I'm here I want to be here for a purpose. So, I don't know what that means yet for the future. But of course, if it's the right opportunity, then this is where I want to be. If it made sense? Yes. If it makes sense. It's the only racing I'm interested in at this stage of my career. F1, it's what I love and it's where I see myself if I'm doing any racing. But as I said, if, let's say, the stars don't align, and it doesn't make perfect sense next year, and if it means taking that time off to kind of reset or re-evaluate, then if that's the right thing to do, then I'm willing to. Honestly, it's one of those ones where, after all this, there's kind of a bit of a weight off the shoulders, and it's just to go out there and just race, go have fun. I always feel like I've got a point to prove. But there's also, you know, although the team has made this decision, there is still… the team is behind me to make me get the most out of the last nine races and to finish on a high. So there's a lot of people that support me and want me to do well. And I'm not one to just drive around and enjoy it. Like I want to drive around as competitively, as fast as possible. So there's no slacking off. There's none of that. It's just go out, have fun, and try and get another Monza moment. I think like picking myself up is, I don't want to say it's easy, but it's something I feel I'm very capable of doing. This is certainly a big moment in time for my career. But even if things aren't maybe always highlighted you're always going through challenges, or you always have to pick yourself up you know. I remember actually here in 2008, when I was racing in the Formula Renault Junior category, it was like a Saturday night before the race on Sunday, and I got like a real pep talk. I was just in one of those moments in my career at the time and I still hadn't yet made it but I knew that I really had to pull my head in kind of thing and start making it happen. So you always go through these… I mean, no one has a perfect career. So I think I've learned to deal with it over time. For sure, now this is another challenge, another hurdle, but I simply see it as, if I want to pick myself up, I will. As I said that, that fire, that belief is still in me. So it's really just a choice that, you know, if I want to make that choice, I can. And obviously, I don't have every option on the grid or anything, you know, and it's not like I can race wherever I want but in terms of just from a self-worth point of view, absolutely. As I touched on, it's a decision they’ve made, but it doesn't change the way I'm going to go racing. I only know how to race one way. And, you know, I went in to see… Because I hadn't really seen the team, I had simulator during the week, so I saw a few engineers, but I hadn't seen you know, the wider team and I saw the mechanics and that this morning and you know, there's a lot of hugs and a lot of people obviously want me to do well and are going to support me until the end. So that's that. As I say, I owe it to myself, but also to the ones who support and want me to do well. There's no better feeling than success in this sport and being up on the podium and that, so I know if I apply myself then maybe we will find a way to do it in the last nine races. I honestly still don't know what the future holds for Oscar. But yeah, I mean, from the terms of that, it's just business. And obviously Mark’s just doing his job for Oscar. So I don't take any of that personal. Assuming Oscar… I think he is kind of guaranteed a spot on the grid next year somewhere. So I will support him, and I will support a fellow Aussie and yeah, I don't I don't take it personal. And you had a second part of the question. Have I heard from him? No. I don't think there's been a reason for him to reach out. I said, I'm sure they're going through their stuff as well. So yeah, I’ve obviously been trying to sort my stuff out. Yeah, it wasn't dropped. It wasn't just a random call one day that ‘hey, this is what we're doing’. We’d been in dialogue for really the last few months. And it wasn't always, it wasn't like ‘don't top five this race and you're done’. But it was more, you know, what can we do? How can we as a collective, try to keep making this work? And, obviously, I'd try to give feedback on obviously the things I would struggle with on the car, and there was a lot of, I guess, dialogue, but also that was, you know, I understood that was also a point of concern, because the results I was getting were not up to, I guess, the level that we all thought they could have been. So we did talk, yeah, I certainly want to say months about it, and ways to try and rectify the issues, but then also, potentially, like, ‘Okay, what next? What now?’ And we kind of just came to, unfortunately, a bit of a dead end, where we felt like we'd exhausted most things that were at least in reach at the time. And that's when obviously, they made the decision. I've never been a massive fan of the big run-offs and that, of tarmac. So it's just like, you have to build up to a limit, as opposed to go over the limit and work back. So I think having the gravel there is good in some places. I've seen it's a lot closer to the track exit on quite a few corners. So yeah, as I said, kind of building up. And obviously, if you go off, then you go off. So I think it just changes a little bit the approach, I don't think it changes that necessarily like the style or the character of the track, but probably the approach. Well, I'm not going to tell them not to support me! But yeah, look, as I touched on earlier with a previous question, it's obviously… People will feel, I guess, emotional towards the decision. But it's business, in terms of… As I said, Mark’s looking out for Oscar, he's got a job to do for him. So you know, that's where this is… It’s a sport, but business at the same time, so you have to kind of put yourself first, if you will. And that's that. It's not certainly not the outcome I wanted, you know, and as I said, when I joined the team, I had a much different idea of how it would go. But it's the reality of the situation. And obviously, that's where Zak and the team felt like it was going so that was that. But yeah, I don't know. Happy to have the support, but I don't want to condone any negative feelings towards others.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,McLaren
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, as you say, I've been in that situation before. And sometimes, for people sitting back in the computers, in social media, it's very easy to judge thingsbut for us, this is our life, this is what we want to do and we still want to be in the sport. But I think it's always good to sit back sometimes, you know, and just enjoy the time. Because whatever comes next, you will be great. I mean, Daniel, it's in a privileged position as well, the career he's had up to now. And I'm sure he will find the right opportunity for him. Yeah, we hopefully are competitive, and it would be nice to be in the mix for the win. It's looking a bit wet for the next few days. So yeah, a few opportunities are there. I think certainly into Turn One it’s good. You know, we've always had discussions, people going off, getting advantage, and people just pushing each other off. So it will be important that we all behave a bit more through Turn One. And I think the other, Eau Rouge,  it's mainly a safety concern, which hopefully, it's better. You know, it doesn't send the cars back to the tr=ack. Yeah, I think definitely it would be good to see if it works, if it makes the issues better that we are currently facing with track limits. And if we are able to adopt it in basically all the tracks, you know, and just get rid of it. It will be quite interesting, because I think certainly here, it's a big change in that regard.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Red Bull
Nicholas Latifi,"No, I didn't bump into anyone this year. It was a very nice break, fortunately. I got a bit of everything in, which was quite nice. Straight after Budapest, I did a day on the sim, and then went back to Canada right away to spend some time with my family and with my girlfriend, then we went over to Greece for our own little holiday. And then we ended off with a trip to Poland to see her family. So we fit everything in and yeah, I feel relaxed and refreshed. We weren’t on the same island I think! I think you were in Mykonos? I was in Crete. Different islands. He was on the party island, I was on the relaxing Island. I'm optimistic it should be more competitive than we were last time out in Budapest. I mean, we've seen these tracks that require the maximum downforce, we've tended to struggle at. The past races when you've needed that set-up. This track is obviously not the case. Checo said there could be a bit of wet weather playing a part and when it has rained, we have the tendency to at-least outperform the dry performance of the car. So yeah, I mean, there's hopefully going to be some opportunities and yeah, just as for me, this track is always a nice one to get back into it after the summer break. For me. It's one of the more enjoyable tracks on the calendar. So we're looking forward to getting going. Yeah, so from my side, still nothing really new to comment on or to announce. I mean, I know what the objective is from my side. The team wants performance, I know, and obviously, that's clear. I mean, at the end of the day, it's going to be the performance that's going to decide everything. So yeah, it's just for me, trying to, tackle these next few races and get the most out of myself and the car, I feel, from the past few races before the summer break, it's been on a much, much better path than it was looking at the beginning of the season. So, it's just… my goal is kind of continuing where I felt that I left off in prior to the summer break, and showing what I can. It sounds simple. It's obviously not simple – but, that's what the goal is. Yeah, I think it's a step in the right direction. I mean, when you look at, specifically, a turn like Turn 1, which even before there was the gravel put in this year, it wasn't really a track limits corner, because there was the big sausage kerb, but I think what us drivers would like is, especially corners that you do have the motivation to play with the limits of the white line a bit. It's probably what we want to see more because it just sets the hard limit, then, you know, no questions asked about track limits. So, I think it's gone in the right direction. I mean, to be honest, with the exception of that corner, I mean, did walk around the track this morning, I don't think it’s going to make much of a difference. Everywhere else, the layout of the track and everything, the kerbs, it's really minor changes, obviously, some new tarmac in places, but yeah, I think it's a good step.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Williams
Pierre Gasly,"Definitely! Yeah, that’s quite a good number, I must say. My taxi driver coming to Spa asked me for how long I was planning to stay in the sport. And I told him another 10 years, hopefully. So, I don't know how to feel about this 100th grand prix. But clearly a good number to achieve. I'm not going to go through the these past few years, we obviously know the highlight of it, and hopefully the next 100 will be even more successful than this. Well, I think this year, it's quite fair to say, it's been harder than we would have liked and harder than expected. Last time out in Budapest, we came close to the points, starting from the pit lane. So hopefully, this weekend, we can be in the mix for the top 10. But we know we need to get everything perfectly right to be in the fight. So that's going to be the main target. Similar common to the guys. I must say I'm quite…. I like it a lot more to have the gravel, like the straight after the curves, because I do think if you do a mistake and go off track, at least you pay a real price for it, rather than having a big piece of tarmac where you can rejoin the track. I think just a new approach of racing, you know, also for the race start, coming into Turn 1, 20 cars coming there, it just changes slightly, your approach and the stuff you can try. No, it's definitely better, Turn 1.  I walked the track this morning. Turn 1, Turn 9, Turn 12 as well. So yeah, we may see more Safety Cars. I don't know, maybe we’ll see a bit more actions or a bit more yellow flags. I don't know but at least it really forces you to be more disciplined and have a slightly different approach compared to the past. So yeah. in favour of that.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,AlphaTauri
Sebastian Vettel,"Not really. I don't know. Maybe? It's just me, but I find it difficult to… I always tend to look forward to the next thing and I don't spend that much time looking back. So it has been less like… You know the people around me expected it to be, saying that, you know, I received… which was great, I received an overwhelming, to be fair, so many congratulations and support after the announcement in Hungary. I find it difficult to reflect all these years, in just a short time. So maybe it will hit me at some point later on. But yeah, I just enjoyed the break. The fact that the decision or the fact that I was carrying this decision around with me for such a long time in a way that it's out felt quite liberating. So I could just enjoy the break and the time I had and also looking very much forward to the races that I have left. So yeah. But it didn't feel like a different break. You know, it's not like this is the last summer break. I think it's difficult for any athlete, man or woman, to know what life is going to be like after you sort of step away from what you've done your whole life. But then again, I feel time will tell. Yeah, I mean, I'm generally very competitive in most things. Even though I feel like I've calmed down off track in some of the things, maybe racing to the cashier is not anymore as much of a challenge as it used to be years ago, but yeah, definitely when I'm in the car, I want to extract the best and most from, so I feel I'm very much looking forward to these races because I feel free in my head in terms of what's going to happen and yeah, hopefully we'll be able to enjoy it. Yes and no. I was told on the Sunday? The Saturday or Sunday of Hungary. And then to be honest, I didn't follow any news in the break, just because it felt like a good strategy not to follow. I mean, I'm interested in what's going on, you know, with the regs and with the cars and all of these things but I thought it was it was a good choice to not follow any Formula 1 news. So I had a couple of phone calls in the break, and, you know, people from the outside, sort of friends and stuff that I got to see, they filled me in of what's going on. I heard it was quite turbulent. But I actually don't know what the current state is. Obviously, I was very… Maybe I have too much empathy for a Formula 1 driver, but very saddened by hearing what's going to happen to Daniel. I think it's a very, very difficult situation to be in. I think he's still one of the best drivers. I raced against him. I had the pleasure to race against him and the not so pleasurable side of getting beaten by him years ago, and I still think he has very, very much to offer. I don't know the details, but I guess McLaren failed to extract the potential that he has. And it's sad to see that he's been put in a difficult position. But I wish him, obviously, all the best and I'm sure that ultimately the talent he has, and the qualities he has, will shine through. Well, there's Mick obviously, we shouldn't forget him. But yeah, I think it goes… You know, there's no guarantee that you have German drivers or a driver of a specific nationality on the grid. I think it goes in cycles and we had, at some point, nearly half the grid German drivers, like seven or eight or six, I don't remember. And now, next year, it might be down to one, maybe two? I don't know, we'll see what happens. But yeah, I remember that a lot of people from the French media were asking, there's no French drivers, where are the French drivers? Now we have a couple of French drivers. And yeah, so I think naturally it goes in cycles. But what's going on in Germany? I don't know, maybe Germans are very realistic and, you know, motor sport has gotten more and more expensive. I think if I had to start, if I was seven again today, I'm not sure I would make it, just because you need to have the financial backing at a very, very early age. It has turned into an elite sport. And, hopefully, you know, we're taking the right actions, especially through go-karts to make it more affordable. There has been too many too much money around and too much money being thrown at the manufacturers and different dealers and teams. So it's hard to blame them, they need to make their living and survive as well. But yeah, maybe that's a little bit the trouble, that overall motor sport has become… I don't know how to change that, but too professional. And with professionalism there's also the financial aspect. I mean, look at Formula 1. Now we have the budget cap to try and counter that but there was no limit before we entered that era, where we are in today, and teams were spending more money than they had and that's for all the teams. Obviously, the ones that have more spend even more. It's not an easy one to fix. And hopefully we will continue to have Mick definitely and then hopefully some other Germans coming up. No, I want to finish the job that I set out doing. I don't know. Time will tell. You know, I think obviously, I'm entering a different stage of my life very different. But yeah, time will tell. I mean, I have so much experience, I have so many lessons that I learned about the sport, not just about driving, but more bigger picture about the sport. It would be very easy to pick up certain roles and share that expertise. But then again, it depends what exactly and I guess if you pick up something, then you want to do it right. I think that would be my drive, at least, behind it. So I don't know. It depends on the role. And it depends on the seriousness. I'm not thinking of being an expert running around and telling these guys what they're doing wrong. I don't see myself doing that. Well, I know Stefano and I think it was, I haven't read exactly, but it was a very unlucky choice of words. Because it's statements like that, that I guess women are, probably all girls, are probably confronted with when they grow up and sharing their dreams, I don't know sitting at breakfast, saying that I want to become a racing driver. And then, you know, the father might have just read exactly that statement and makes it clear to her that, ‘but you do like other things, why not focus on other things’, and then maybe they do focus on other things and drop racing or the idea of it. It's important that we don't say these things, because you know, there's sparks everywhere. I don't see a reason why we can't have a woman on the grid. I think the challenges we are facing, they can be faced by women. So, I do the opposite. I encourage every girl at the breakfast lunch or dinner table to speak up and prove Stefano, in this regard, wrong and all these people wrong. Let's say that, you know, certain things can't be done by you, because you are a girl or a woman, I think this this sort of stereotype thinking is slowly disappearing, but has to disappear completely. Yeah, I mean, I would love to fight for the win but I think being realistic, with the package that we have, we are far away from that. But yeah, I'm very motivated and very much looking forward, like I said earlier. I feel free to enjoy these races. I'm looking forward to work with the team trying to extract everything we can, obviously develop the car as much as we can till the end of the year. I won't benefit from most of the development next year or of any development for next year but still I see that I can do you know the job the way that I've always done it and I want to finish it that way and I also see that we can have great results. I don't know it might be a fifth place. It might be a very, very lucky podium. You never know what's happening. I think for here, it's mostly redemption, because last year we didn't have a race, which was very bad for the people that came and turned up. I think it's one of the best tracks in the world. After Suzuka, maybe the second best track. But yeah, I'm very much looking forward to racing here. I think I agree with everything that's been said.",Belgian Grand Prix,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Not really. I was, of course, hoping that I could get close to a podium, but very tricky conditions out there. But I think we had a really good strategy. You know, we were really reactive and always pitting at the right time. I think we had some good out laps. And then at the end, even with the 360˚, we won the race. Yeah. So I was struggling a bit with the shifts and the clutch. And we had to change a few things around that to not basically burn the clutch. And that cost a bit of performance. And I think that caught me out, out of that corner. But luckily, I could do a 360˚, so I lost one spot. Yeah, it was very good, with a lot of… I was battling a lot of guys, so it was a lot of fun out there. Yeah, he was struggling on the Hard tyre. So we had a good run out of the… (Sees replay of his own spin) Heating up the rear tyres, let’s say it like that. It was a crazy race and of course, very happy that we won it. I mean, that's what a normal Dutchy would do, right. So maybe I should get back to it. Yeah, I think nobody really expected this. But yeah, we said to each other that we have to remain calm before the race. And I think we did that. And we made all the right calls in the race. It was a bit hectic for me in the first lap, getting a bit boxed in and staying out of trouble. But after that, we had a few overtakes and then, yeah, we pitted it at the right time. We put the right tyres on the car. I think that was the most important thing today, to have the grip. And, yeah, slowly we were just moving forward. Then, I think that final stop was very good, at the time we planned it. And then I basically saw that Charles was struggling a lot on the Hard tyre, so that was my moment to try and attack him. I got him and then I spun, did a 360˚, lost the position again. Yeah, it was a bit unlucky, of course. But then we just kept our heads down and got him back again, pulled a gap and basically managed that to the end, because it started to drizzle as well. And no more risk to take and just bring it home. Well, after that final stop, and I saw that it was Charles there and then Checo in the middle and I could see he was really struggling for warm up and I was like, this is my chance to go for it. I think we were competitive. But I think also Ferrari chose the wrong tyres in their final stint before they then pitted again. Because before that I think they were quite strong as well. And yeah, it was just being on the right tyre, you know. I think also the call we had in the beginning, to be on the soft, was a bit safer, you know, to stay out of trouble and have a bit of grip. So yeah, I think it's still, you know, it's about little details again. And, yeah, we just keep on working, keep on trying to improve the car, because I think there are still a few more areas where we can work on to do better. But again, of course, after the break, we have a few races that are a bit different to this track as well. So it will be interesting to see how competitive we're going to be there. Yeah, we were planning to start on the Hard tyre, but then I went to the grid on the Soft tyres, and I was already struggling for grip, so I was like ‘no way we're going to start at the Hards’. So, it's also credit to the team, because we of course planned the strategy around that, with the Hard tyre, and then we were like okay, we were switching it to a Soft, we had a lot of confidence in just changing it around, then that's what we did. I'm very happy that we did, because, yeah, the Hard tyre was really, really tough. And you could see that with Charles and Carlos ,they were sliding around a lot. So, that was after we made up our minds with the Soft, that was never, I think, I consideration I find it difficult to say if this is the most competitive race we’ve had. I think a lot of it was also about just choosing the right tyres at the right time. Of course, we know that our car is, in general, is quick, but I think throughout the race, Ferrari was also very fast, just they made the wrong call with the Hard tyre. So, there's still a lot of things we can look into, what we can do better. And yeah, I think the race itself was of course very good. I mean starting tenth, winning the race on a track like this is of course very, very good. But yeah, there are a lot of things we will analyse even and look into what we could have done better. I mean, there are always a few areas where we could have done better. But overall, of course, I'm very happy with today. It's incredibly important if you want to fight for a Championship. You know, you can't afford many mistakes. It's of course, very hard, to always be on the good side, let's say it like that. But I think we have a lot of good guys in the team and girls. Today, I think Hannah [Schmitz], our strategist, was insanely calm. Yeah, she's very good. I don't know. We’ll of course try to win as many as we can in the remaining races we have. But of course, more importantly, we have to keep the lead in the Championship. That's, of course, what we have to try and secure. Yeah, our strategy was out of the window after the laps to the grid! So, we had to change it around and make a new one. But I don't think that's very hard for the team. You know, they're very flexible, and they know what they're doing. So yeah, it was a bit different. And also, it was anyway, it was a bit difficult to predict, going into the race. We didn't know that it was going to be spitting for most of the race you know? Makes it all a bit more tricky on the tyres. Yeah, they told me on the radio that there might be a bit of rain coming and then of course, with the tyres dropping, and you know, temperatures in general, that always makes it a bit more tricky. And then we got the VSC as well, so you lose even more tyre time so that last lap was yeah, it was driven really slowly, just to make sure that you wouldn't spin Not really. I think as a team we still want to win more races and that's what we'll definitely try to do after the break. No, I warmed up my rear tyres a bit more than I would have liked but then I could see that Charles was still struggling on these Hard tyres so I just tried to close up again and go for it again. No, it's good that they are competitive because then they can steal more points off Ferrari. So I'm very happy. They’re doing very well. Yeah, that's of course not acceptable. I mean, these individuals… No, I definitely don't agree with that because that's just disgusting. But overall, I think the majority of the fans which also were cheering a lot, I think throughout the race and also on the podium for every driver, I think that's how it should be. And yeah, those videos, or video, of burning merch I think that's disgusting. Well,I think everyone always tries to do their best and sometimes that's of course a bit harder to achieve but yeah, I find that difficult to comment because nobody does things on purpose and everyone always wants of course to try and get the best result out of it. And from my side as well, I always try to get the best result out of it and the team as well.  Sometimes you do that better than other weekends. And we also dropped quite a few points as well from our side by having issues but yeah, I find that difficult to say that they helped me because at the end of the day you always have to perform yourself and as a team. Once you’re in the lead, then you have these things and you don't have anyone in front then you hear these weather reports which is not great. Like I explained before, tyre temperatures are dropping and then of course, you have some guys behind you on a fresher set, softer set as well. So then it's not amazing, but my gap luckily was big enough of course to manage. And my spin? I don't know, I just went on throttle  and I completely lost the rear. But I think from lap five or six… basically once I started to get close to Lewis and Lando. I started to have issues with the clutch and the upshifts. So we had to do quite a few changes around that to try and minimise the slip. And that was always having a bit of like wheel slip on the throttle. So I don't know; it just caught me out completely out of that corner. It was a bit better to follow but still very hard to  pass and I think you definitely needed a bit of tyre advantage or like people struggling on tyres or choosing the wrong tyre, the harder compound and it would drizzle is on the track. I think all of that played a role in the opportunities of overtaking more than compared to let's say, it would have been a sunny day. And I think then it would still be quite a bit of a struggle to pass.",Hungary,post-race,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I honestly don't know. I was definitely struggling at the beginning of the race and wasn't sure whether I'd be able to catch the guys up. But bit by bit I got a bit more comfortable with the balance. I had a really good start as well. I really want to acknowledge my team who have continued to push and never give up through this tough year that we've had so far. For us to be on the podium, both cars to be on the podium twice, is pretty special for us. And really unlucky for George today. You know, the other guys still have a bit of an edge but we're clearly closing the gap. And this is just an amazing way to go into the break knowing that we have this performance. Hopefully, we'll bring some more into the second part of the season and start fighting with the guys up front. I definitely think being a little bit cooler, it seemed to work a little bit better for us. I can't tell you exactly why, but grateful for it. I was hoping it was going to rain at the end so I could challenge Max, but we ran out of laps. With a bit of a better qualifying, if the DRS was OK yesterday, we would have been in the running for the win. But either way, two seconds in a row I’m really, really happy. So huge thank you to the fans for all the amazing support. Enjoy your summer. Bless you guys. That's probably just banging against the side of the cockpit. I don't really… I’ve never seen that before. My arms are OK, so… Of course. Yeah, just training, refocusing, re-centred and making sure we come back strong in the second half. It's hugely satisfying. It's a great feeling for us, given the year we've had, and obviously to see the progress that we've started to make. Last week, just getting the second place last week was huge for us already, and this is already, now two races in a row that George and I have shared a podium, which is fantastic for the team, points-wise. To both finish ahead of the Ferraris is huge for us, given the pace that they've had. And, for me, obviously, starting the race in seventh and getting up here is a great recovery. And I think given the troubles we had through the weekend, that shows that we've got really great pace. I would say probably that second stint. Going longer in that second stint, giving me the option to then go to the softer tyre at the end. That offset that I enabled myself to get.  I think probably the race was lost probably with the first stint, with that Medium tyre, but then towards the second and the third part of the race was pretty epic. We would definitely have been closer to Max, I would have thought. But who knows? Maybe I wouldn't have been able to go the same distance on those tyres. And who knows? But if we had started, where I think we probably should have started, without the problem yesterday, I think then we would have been in a much better place to race Max today, yeah. I hope so. That's what we're working towards. I think today there was potential for…  I think this weekend, there was a potential for a win. You saw George on pole. I think if we had both been up there, I think we probably could have worked a bit better together as a team. One of us would have had to support each other strategy-wise. But I think if we are able to take this pace into the second half of the season for sure we can start to fight with the guys. This is the first time we've been able to fight and battle with a Ferrari. That's huge for us. I think the Red Bulls probably still are ahead. The fact that Max started 11th (sic) and spun and still was 10 seconds ahead says enough about their car but I think we still have made huge progress and huge steps. And so to have this consistency and two double podiums in these last two races gives us great hope and a huge push for the second half. It wasn't an ounce of wet part of the track just so you know.  It was completely dry, and it didn't rain enough unfortunately. Not really much after that. That's a good answer.",Hungary,post-race,Mercedes
George Russell,"Yeah, it was… When it started spitting at the beginning, and we were on the soft tyres, I thought we were on and we obviously made a really strong start. It was a good first stint. And then towards the end on the Mediums and the rain started to come down I really struggled and losing a bit of temperature. But again, amazing job by the team – pole position yesterday, double podium, we're definitely making progress. So really proud of the work everybody's done. Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot I’ll look over and that I could have done better. It was challenging to manage the tyres. Obviously, we pitted quite early on both stints. So you're trying to eke the tyre out until the end but trying to push as fast as possible at the same time. So a bit of a challenging position to be in but nevertheless pleased to come away with a podium. Yeah but I think you know it's been an incredibly intense start to the season and I think the break we'll do everybody good. We’ll come back in the second half of the season, reset, refocus and try and fight for some victories. Yeah, definitely. It was always going to be a tricky afternoon because there was rain in the air throughout. And usually, if you're on pole position, and it's spitting, you're pretty disappointed, but knowing I was on the soft tyre, I was kind of rubbing my hands together and made a really good start: the first four laps was really strong, pull the gap, three seconds, I think to Carlos. And then unfortunately, the rain sort-of stopped, the Medium tyres came into their own. But we still had a good first stint. And we pitted early, both occasions to try and cover Max, cover the Ferraris. Ultimately, Max was too fast for us today. But then, that put us in a very tricky place on that last stint when we were on the Mediums. I was already struggling a bit and my engineer said we had 25 laps ago, and the rain started falling, temperature was dropping. I thought, ‘it's going to be a tricky last few laps.’ But Lewis did an amazing job. And obviously had far superior pace at the end. Could be, I think, had a very strong middle stint. So, I think as a team, we've got a lot to be proud about. We did everything right. For both of us today to give us, as a team, the best opportunity to fight for victory. Unfortunately, it didn't go our way today. As a team, we did everything right. Yeah, I think it was a good weekend, obviously. Coming away with pole position was great. I think we had a really strong first stint on the soft tyre which, given how the conditions panned out, probably wasn't the best tyre for that stint. Obviously, you're always disappointed if you start from pole, to finish anything lower than first position, you'll be disappointed with. But when you look at everything objectively, I think that was probably a fair result. No. Yeah, I think the drizzle made it exciting and there were certain points in the race it probably made the tyres and cars go faster because the tyres may have been overheating slightly and the drizzle helped. But definitely, in that last stint when the Medium tyre was towards the end of its life and the rain was coming, it felt pretty, pretty frustrating. But on the flip side for me in those first four laps when I was on the soft, I think it definitely benefited me. It's just I wish it could have stayed for longer, less at the end and more at the beginning and I think it would have transformed the race. I think we need to just continue to keep an open mind. I don't think changing car concept is going to make us go any faster, maybe the contrary to be honest. Sometimes you just got to  stick to the process and keep on pushing. And that's difficult to do when you're off the pace and things don't seem to be going your way. But personally, I believe in every single person within our team and I think we're making huge progress for the time being and you know, we saw with the job we did yesterday, you saw with the pace that both of us showed today, I think at the start of the season we were finishing races a minute behind first position. The last two races we’ve been within 10 seconds so I think it's definitely going in the right direction. Thank you.",Hungary,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, mostly we are focusing on ourselves. So today, it's not been a great day. I've been struggling massively with the tyres and just had a lot of inconsistency to put the tyres in the right window with those conditions. And so I struggled to put a lap together, but we'll look into it. I'm pretty sure we've got the pace in the car to come back a bit more at the front tomorrow. So we'll focus on that and hopefully we have a better Sunday. Yeah, the pace is there. So we just need to understand what went on with the tyres today and I'm pretty sure that we can come back tomorrow. No, today I struggled massively, especially in Q3. Q1, Q2, I felt quite good. We were doing good steps in the right direction but then in Q3, I don't know what happened. The track changed a little bit, the sun came out, and suddenly the tyres were definitely not in the right window. So, I struggled a lot with inconsistency. I did the first lap in Q3, that was quite slow. And then the second lap that was more or less okay. But yeah, we paid a little bit the price of not having the tyres in the right window. But yeah, congratulations to George. It's a special one:  the first pole, and he did an amazing job. I mean, on my side, it was quite okay Q1 and Q2, but then Q3, for some reason. I Don't know what we did; we need to analyse because there was something that was feeling a bit weird. So yeah, we'll look into it because the feeling was just not good. Between one and three! We’ll see. I think the performance is there. We are quite quick, so hopefully we can gain some places tomorrow. Honestly, I mean, at the end, we need just to do the best job possible. So, focus on ourselves. I don't think there's anything needed there, or just obviously not taking any risk in between cars. But that's normal. So, I don't think anything special for tomorrow, no. Yeah, nothing to add.  I think we'll try and go for the win. And, and yeah, Max is starting tenth so it might take him a bit more laps to come back to the front but we'll just focus on ourselves and try to win the race. I think things will change quite a bit compared to what we've seen yesterday so we just need to be able to adapt as quickly as possible. On my side I struggled with tyres today but tomorrow the race is going to be a complete different thing. So yeah, quite a bit of work tonight to understand in which direction it’s going to go for tomorrow and to be as ready as possible.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, definitely. Feeling better and better every race and every qualifying session. Today I felt like I had a base to do a pole position. It went away from us there in the last sector with a few snaps through the lap. But congratulations to George because he must have done a pretty good lap there in the Merc. And yeah, we will race from P2 tomorrow. Yeah, I think we have the pace. Obviously the start and the tyre management will play a key role like always. The Mercedes race pace is a bit of an unknown and we will have to see how the race plays out tomorrow. And if we can get them on the start then better but I think it will be an exciting race. Yeah, it was good. I felt like today I had everything more-or-less under control through the whole Qualifying. We keep making steps in the right direction, which keeps getting me more comfortable and more together with the car, and today there were some good laps over there. But yeah, probably that Q3 Run 2 lap was nothing special. And it was not good enough for pole. So, a bit disappointed, because with a perfect lap for sure I could  have been up there. But I guess George did a very good lap today in the Merc and he deserves that one. So congrats. Well, clearly the track conditions, as they've switched, especially particularly on Soft tyres, maybe they haven't gone in our direction because yesterday we seem to have a pace advantage that we certainly didn't have today, even Q1, Q2. Going through those two sessions, we were not… we didn’t have the margin that we had in other races this year. And we had to make sure we put on a set of new tyres and do it at the right time because the midfield was certainly closer to us than where they were yesterday. And for us, we've been struggling to get the tyres into temperature over one lap here. We are certainly not particularly happy about today, the way the car and everything was handling, but with a perfect lap, I could have put it up there. So, that's why I'm a bit disappointed. Nothing to add. I guess get a good start first of all, and then nail the tyre management. I think it's going to be quite tricky. There was quite a lot of deg yesterday, on all tyres. I think the race is going to be a long race. 70 laps. Yeah, I think it's still a lot to play for. As I said, the race pace of the Merc is going to be an unknown and we don't know if they're going to be as quick as today or not. And I think we have to stay open-minded, do the best we can. But yeah, I felt very comfortable with the car all weekend so we should be quick tomorrow. I don't know if it's safe, I don't know what do you mean by safe, but I think tomorrow our target is to win the race not focus too much where Max is because we know that if we want to get points in the championship, the easiest way to do that is by winning so independent of where Max is we want to go for that win. Yeah, we need to see how with these conditions, this wind, how the car behaves in stabilised conditions, you know. Today's a soft tyre, you start dealing with it quite cold out of the box and the car is behaving one way or the other. But tomorrow when the tyres are up to temperature in a sustainable condition the car could change completely, and hopefully we're going to find a bit more pace than today and we can have a strong run in the first stint and go from there. I think the car has been quick all weekend so there's no reason why not to believe that tomorrow we should be strong.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Ferrari
George Russell,"Over the moon, absolutely buzzing. I mean, yesterday was probably our worst Friday of the season and everybody last night was working so hard. We didn't really know what direction to go in. And then that last lap, got round Turn 1, mega Turn 1, went round Turn 2, Turn 2 was mega. And the lap time just kept on coming and kept on coming. And I came across the line, looked at the screen and saw we went P1. And that was an incredible, incredible feeling. I don't know, to be honest. We need to look into it and understand where that came from today. There's a few ideas we have. At the end of the day, there's no points for qualifying. But we generally have good race pace, but the Ferraris looked very fast on Friday, but we're going to be absolutely going for it. But either way, that was a pretty special day, no doubt. For me, I’m not really thinking about myself to be honest, but for us as a team it’s massive. Yesterday was probably our toughest Friday of the whole season. We were all here until 11pm last night, scratching our heads and morale was pretty down. And we felt pretty lost. And to come back and grab pole position 24 hours later, it's just such a [good] feeling, because I know what we went through last night. And there are no points for qualifying but I guess getting this result for all of us is pretty, pretty huge. I think today, we just got it perfectly in the window on that last lap. I went round Turn 1 and I was a tenth and a half up. I went round Turn 2 and I was three tenths up and everything was just perfectly in the window. And when you're on one of those laps, and you're in the groove, in the rhythm, it just keeps on coming and keeps on coming. I think everybody struggled quite a lot with tyres. A lot of people struggled this morning in the wet with the tyres. And we've been going all over the place to try and get our heads around it. But fortunately, we sort of nailed it on that last run. Dare I say better than the Spa one, I don't know! I don't think the feeling of this pole and the feeling of that Spa lap, I don't think I'll ever have qualifyings that will ever come close to these two feelings. Because obviously this was my first. As a team we’ve struggled so much. At Williams we were so far behind so to get that second was massive. So you know, this is what racing is about. This is why I wake up every single day and I want to be world champion, because feeling like this is something you can't really dream of. It’s a total unknown. We've turned the car upside down since yesterday. Conditions are changing and it’s going to be much cooler tomorrow. Our high fuel pace was probably the worst it's ever been yesterday and Ferrari look pretty exceptional. But you know, we're behind the curve at the moment, but we'll be absolutely going for it. And, you know, victory is what we're going for. I think the nature of this circuit, when you get everything absolutely hooked up, nothing comes close, because it's so fast, so flowing, every corner leads on to the next. It’s so difficult to compare very different conditions, but pure driving probably the one today. They were more, probably, chats of overall philosophy. And if we're going in the right direction, as a team. We've been closing the gap but obviously yesterday was a disastrous day. We believe that there were many reasons as to why, and they all added up to making us well over a second off the pace. But that felt like we were being a bit generous. But then to have a day like today. Maybe P1 on pure pace – obviously Max had a bit of an issue – who knows, but we definitely turned it around. And we're probably back to where we kind-of hope to hope to be. No, you don't even think about it. You take each day at a time; you don't get carried away with yourself and you just focus. Step by step, getting off the line, good start, good first stint. Is it going to be a one, two or three stop? Charles said it's going to be between a one and a three. I don't think he was probably joking there. Based on Friday, could be a three but based on the conditions of tomorrow, it might be a one. So, we know we have, relatively speaking, a faster race car than we do a qualifying car. If that's going to be the case again this weekend, I'll be very shocked. I think we just absolutely nailed today 100 per cent and got every last millisecond out of it. Hopefully, we're not planning to defend and  we're just driving off into the sunset. But I know the guys around me and even Max, they're not going to make it easy. As I said, generally speaking, we feel like we have a faster race car. This is a good place where you need a good qualifying, no doubt, but it's still a circuit that if you have a faster race car, it counts for more than if you have a faster qualifying car. So if it's a two or a three stop race, you won't be able to defend, let's say, because the other cars can go early, they can go late and they'll find a way past. Personally I've never doubted it. I think it's clear we've had a difficult season as a team. Qualifying historically for me has been one of my strengths. This year I've struggled a little bit but Budapest is a circuit I've always loved, I've always been fast here and I always knew if the car and myself were working perfectly together there's no reason why we can't achieve great things. So yeah, tonight, good night's sleep, focus everything for tomorrow. But this is a huge day for us regardless. That stat being the first one to get the first victory for your team is meaningless. I think we're both here wanting to fight for World Championships and to do that you need pole positions and you need race victories. We need to work together. Today was a great day, but something like that I I'm not focused about, I just want to do the best job possible, as simple as that. Well, we made a big step forward so I'm not going to tell you about that. In Formula 1, it's (about) fine margins and there's so many fine margins and so many different aspects and when you get everything into that perfect window, the car can just fly.  Equally, if one thing is just out, it can compromise everything. So there's no guarantees, the changes we made overnight will translate into performance tomorrow, there's no guarantees it will translate into performance in the future races, but for sure, for today, for the conditions it did. So let's review again tomorrow. To be honest, I'm already thinking about tomorrow. I'm thinking about the run off the line, turn one, how can I try and keep a lead, and what I'm going to have to do to win the race. You know, getting a pole position is great, having a good Saturday is great but as I learned quite a lot last year, and as I've also learned a lot this year, Saturday doesn't mean a huge amount. Sunday is when the points and prizes are won but I'm just so happy for what it means to us as a team, the progress we've made, and obviously going into the summer break, having a Saturday like this and a qualifying like this was huge. So we'll do our best to have a great day tomorrow. But yeah, I think we can be happy that we've at least had one good Saturday from the first 12 or 13 races.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, he has achieved so much in this sport, that it's fully understandable for him to retire. I mean, I think he's had an amazing career. He's won a lot of races; he's won a lot of championships as well. And I think of course, he's a great ambassador for the sport. So, you know, to see him go is… it's something that you can see coming, everyone is getting older, at one point, everyone is retiring. And is of course, never nice when that moment arrives, especially, of course, for Seb’s fans. But these things happen. And I think it's important now that he's just going to enjoy his life with the family, because F1 is such a short period of time in your life that you work so hard to achieve all these things he has achieved and now it's time to enjoy. Yeah, I personally think it's going to be a little bit harder for us. Just purely one-lap performance, especially. I mean, I don't expect it to be terrible but I do think that Ferrari is going to be super strong here, like, of course, they have been the whole year. But I do think that this is a track where they might be, let's say, very strong. But we'll see. Also, the weather: I don't know what's going to happen, how much rain is falling. But all these things can come into play and can do many things to the result. I think if you know me, first of all, I will not be laying on the beach. And second of all, I don't really care about the points gap. Because for me, it's all about trying to be perfect every single weekend. And it's not something that once you have that gap that you start to relax or something. I mean, I still want to win more races. And that's what we'll try to do as a team. Well, I think there are always ideas you know, you want to try out in free practice. So that's what we'll try to do again. I mean, it's nothing drastic or something, it's just general set-up directions you want to look at, to be honest. First time, I guess end of 2013 or something, bit of testing in a Formula Renault car at the time. Yeah, it was here. It was good. I enjoyed it. Food was very nice, did a bit of sightseeing in Budapest. Good memories in general every single year when I come here. I'm always very happy to come back, I even come back sometimes do some private testing and stuff because I think it's an amazing track. And about potentially winning a race here, I mean, of course you tried to win every single Grand Prix. This one hasn't really been done yet. But we'll see what we can do. It’s just a very technical track and if you make a mistake in one corner, especially in Sector Two; then you're normally not well positioned for the next, so it's really like a good combination of corners in a row. I think following has been quite a bit better, so that's positive. But of course, the weight of the cars, they're extremely heavy, which I think it's not great, which I don’t really see a quick solution for. But overall the following and stuff has been a bit better. And I mean, it's difficult to expect really, how much better it would be but for me at least you have a better chance of racing, but then again, on some tracks is still very hard to follow. But that's also in combination with tyres overheating and stuff. So there are a few things to look at. I think in general, they all behave quite well, just a few individuals didn't. So I hope that's different this time. Less races. Twelve. No, I think, like, 16. Just pick all the good tracks. Leave all the others out. No. Just depends how you design your drums, basically, Some have it designed in a way where it comes up more into your face, which I have not experienced. So again, I think you can just limit the design options, you know, it has to go more outward or whatever, which I think we have anyway. If I see brake dust, it always goes out left or right, so it's OK. His hair. It grew back magically. I like that. I wish I had that.",Hungary,thursday,Red Bull
Lance Stroll,"Just touching on Max's saying, he's achieved so much in this sport. He's been a great team-mate. I've really enjoyed working alongside Seb for the last year and a half. We still have half a season to go, but no, it's been great. I've really enjoyed it. And he's achieved so much. And, you know, this was a chapter in his life that I think he's now moving on from, he has a family at home and other things to look forward to in life. So, I wish him all the best going forward. He’s definitely achieved so much. It’s been an incredible career for him and we wish him all the best going forward. He's been a great teammate. Well, definitely not the long debriefs! I think he's good at that but, kidding aside, he's just been a great team player and someone that that's been really easy to work alongside It’s just been fun. He’s a big talent, extremely professional and I think his technical understanding as well, for the car and all that is great. He’s been a great member of the team and someone that that I've really enjoyed working alongside. It's definitely been fun. Well, I think one of the main things is lighter cars. I think the weight of the cars has just become too heavy and I would like to see that be improved going forward in the coming years. There are many things for sure that we can change and do better but off the top of my head that's something that I think would be nice to improve to make the cars a little bit more enjoyable and nimble to drive. No, it’s been OK. His success on track and you know the fact that he's a great person off track. He is, you know, a real gentleman and he's done a lot for the sport and his success on track has been incredible over the years.",Hungary,thursday,Aston Martin
Carlos Sainz,"First of all, wish him all the best now, in the future that he has ahead that I'm sure he's going to enjoy a lot with kids and family. For me he was, since the beginning, since even before arriving to Formula 1, a great role model. I was privileged enough to be simulator driver when he was at his peak in Red Bull, winning the Championships. I could see how professional he was, and it gave me a very good insight into it how you need to behave, or how do you need to be, to be a successful Formula 1 driver like he was. I remember those years very well. He always had kind words for me, stop and have a chat with me, and give me some advice. He's a great role model as these guys have said already, and he's ambassador for the sport, but not only for sport but I think also for a younger generation that is coming through, and a type of career that you would look up to no? Always getting on well with all the teams, with everyone. Everyone in the paddock loves him, you know? You will not hear someone speaking bad about Seb. I think this year speaks about his personality. He's, alive as a human being, not only as a driver, and I think we will miss him. But I hope that we can see him back in the paddock also helping the sport to develop in certain areas that I think he's very vocal about recently. And I hope that he can keep giving us a hand in that in that side. Yeah, I think this year we fancy our chances in every circuit that we go to. Honestly, the competitiveness of the car is definitely not an issue this year. We are competitive everywhere we go to. Sometimes it's true that in race pace or in in some qualis, Red Bull seem to be a bit quicker. In others, we are quicker and it's a great fight. But yeah, I go into every weekend thinking we can win it. And this is no other one. So is the target is the same. We need it. But everyone needs a clean weekend, I think. We all strive for clean weekends, it’s just that in Formula 1, they are more difficult to get than what people think. And yes, we have a very competitive car. It's true that we have some weaknesses to address with reliability, and everything. But it's still a long year ahead. We have something like nine, 10 races, I don't know exactly, and I think if there's anything I've seen this year, it’s that anything can happen in every race. You know, it's been such an up and down year for everyone. Even if the top four seems to be consistent, then the outcome of the weekend is not always as you expect. There's still a lot to play for and a lot to go for. Well, I think it is clear for Ferrari what we need to do, which is to win those races, that Max wants to win and get it on board because obviously getting those 25 points makes quite a big difference in the point swing. I think yeah, there's still a lot of things that could happen up there at the front. I think there's always a great battle going on between the two teams, which I think it's going to  keep going until the end of the year. It is true that maybe at some point we need a bit of help from Red Bull in reliability or DNFs but even without those, statistically if it's open, its open, and you cannot give up. I think this is number one rule in sport: until it's impossible, you need to keep believing and you need to keep trying to win everything you can, and trying to keep yourself in the fight. Until a statistic is no longer in your in your power. Until then, we're going to  keep trying, we're going to  keep developing as a team, we're going to  keep improving because whatever we can learn this year, it can also be useful for the next few years. Oh, definitely!Yeah. Big fan of the beach and big fan of the sea, sport, but at the same time, some quality time with family, friends. Not Max, I will not see him I think – but I see him enough here. Who knows maybe we find each other in Ibiza or somewhere, Mallorca. Confident that we can fight for that win this weekend, and that we can perform a solid weekend like we did in Austrian and France. Then obviously, to get it done. And it's another thing, and we know how complex, I think recent races are. A great example that you can be super competitive, get everything very well done but then to win you need everything to fall into one piece and this is a complex side of Formula 1. But the target is to do so. I'm feeling every race… I'm feeling more comfortable in the car. I think race pace France was good,  in Austria too; the qualifying pace in France was good, especially in Q2.  So, I think we have the ingredients, we just need to put it all together and hopefully celebrate on Sunday. But yeah, let's see. I think I was here back in 2010 for first time. Testing Formula BMW. And I remember coming to the sort of tracks when testing, thinking how I used to see my heroes, Formula 1, driving at this track and what a privilege it was to drive, even if it was a small single seater in a proper Formula 1 track. And those first laps were always very special because you're driving a proper Formula 1 track. I was coming straight from go-karting. And this was one of those circuits that you feel you're closer to Formula 1, because you're driving the track, and it was great fun, always a track that I’ve loved, always a track that I enjoyed as a driver. Maybe tricky for racing, but cool for qualifying, for sure. Even racing hasn't been that bad over the last few years. And I don't remember the rest of the question. Yes, it will. It should be. Every race so far has been a bit better. Sometimes a lot better, others a bit. I always fancy my chances and I will try my best, like always, to get it. I was thinking all this time while they were answering and I couldn't come up with something interesting or something that is possible. I have a lot of ideas but they are all quite impossible… I would like to try a race where we all have the same grip available in our cars, just to try, just to see. Sam speed and same grip available. You can try that. The weight, but you would have to think about the safety. The penalty points, they're all good ideas. But are they possible? Probably not. Especially from now on, no? Yeah. I don't know, it’s many things, mainly as a human being, a lot, for sure, of his legacy that he's left in the paddock, of his career, you could argue pole to win conversion, speed. I think he's always been great, so I don't know, many things I could take from Seb, many stats, many, many things. It’s a pretty idyllic career.",Hungary,thursday,Ferrari
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, to be honest, with him just we have experience just last two years, probably. After I step up to Formula 1. And yeah, he's a great personality guy. And he's definitely also a good ambassador for Formula 1. Yeah, I'm really lucky that I’m able to run close to him, especially Aston Martin, and AlphaTauri are quite close to each other this year. So, I learned a lot of things from him, when I'm driving behind him or even in front of him, whatever. We’ve had a chat a couple of times, so yeah, I mean, he’s definitely…  you know, for me, it's a bit sad but at the same time, was really lucky, and hope he can have an enjoyable time in Formula 1 for the rest of the season. I was driving the old-spec for FP1 in Paul Ricard and I swapped into the new floor for FP2. I felt a clear difference in terms of the general grip, I would say, especially towards high-speed corner. Definitely it was positive, just we struggled a little bit to put it all together as the car balance. It was car balance we struggled to kind of have an ideal balance, but I was still happy that I felt like clear difference. So just looking forward to it. We’ve got a lot of data from Paul Ricard, so yeah, I think we have good confidence that we can put it all together this week. I don't know but probably penalty points, probably. Currently I'm in P1! So something like that. Most of things I get in, like, free practice, traffic things, so probably those things you know. I think we discussed it last time in the Drivers’ Briefing. Have to be more probably big things, if I get like more penalty points. And yeah so far I'm having a quite a lot so yeah that's it. I have eight points No, no issue. Like knowledge about the car I think. He knows about the car, opposite of me! So probably those things.",Hungary,thursday,AlphaTauri
George Russell,"Such an inspiration and such a humble bloke I think. As Carlos said, nobody's got a bad word to say about Seb. He's good fun to be around. So I'm sure he's going to be looking forward to, firstly the last half of the season, but everything he's got planned for the future: family, kids wife and I'm sure he's not going to stop and… as I said, inspiration. We're definitely closing that gap, there's no doubt, but the four cars ahead of us certainly have the pace advantage. There's no doubts about that. But I think, as a team, we're slowly closing the gap. Hopefully after the summer break, we'll add some extra things to the car, but as does everybody, so it's not going to be straightforward. We still believe we can probably fight for victories at some point this season. But I don't think we'll probably ever have the car that will be outright quickest. I think we all know the intellect that Sebastian has, and sharing quite a few meetings with him, behind the scenes, talking with the FIA or F1, or whoever it may be, you do learn how much general knowledge he has; how much Formula 1 knowledge he has. And I'm sure that also goes into the technical side. So, I think it is kind of quite inspiring to see how he conducts himself and his business. And you know, above all, he's just a great bloke, a great human being. And I think in the world today, we lack a lot of people like Seb, so yeah, for sure he’ll be missed. It's a pleasant reminder, I think to all of us, that time is flying. And I remember that day like yesterday, you know, meeting Lewis, he was a superhero to me back then. And as I said, that was 13 years ago now but it felt like yesterday and you need to seize every opportunity, every moment every day, every race for us and just make the most of that one life you have – because it goes quick. So a photograph like that is a reminder for me. Yeah, I think one of my best memories here was driving an F1 car for the first time back in 2017. And I just remember, just feeling the forces that an F1 car produced. I couldn't quite comprehend the speed coming from GP3 at the time. It was incredibly hot, almost 40°C, and my eyes were totally bloodshot, I think it was from the forces, sweating 24/7. And that was just a real taste of what it was to, to drive an F1 car and again, gave me the motivation to say this is what I want to do always. And obviously, as the other two say, we're here to fight for victory every weekend. So nothing changed there. How many do you have? It's so difficult. You can't pinpoint one thing. It's, you know, as Lance and Max said, lighter cars would be great, but you can't have everything in the world. The reason we're heavier is because of safety. So yeah, I don't know. I really can't pick one, because there’s too many compromises. Faster cars. An F1 car has enough downforce to drive upside down, so who can drive the slowest, I guess, upside down before falling off? I’ve had no issue. I know a lot of people have, but again, like Max said, we’ve got different design philosophies, so I think it’s down to the FIA not to give teams a possibility to do something that has an effect of drivers health and safety. Pretty impressed with the beard he's got going at the moment. I struggle a bit to grow a beard. As I said, I think, you know, we're all competitive animals, we all want to win, we all want to win as many championships as possible, but as I said, nobody's got a bad word to say about Seb in the paddock and I think that's probably a legacy you'd probably be quite… He's probably more proud of that than he is of his of his on track successes.",Hungary,thursday,Mercedes
Daniel Ricciardo,"It's, yeah, it's in a way, sad of course, because you're losing a bit of a legend of the sport really. And yeah, I personally spent spend some time alongside him, which was, for sure, a privilege. So yeah, it's one of those ones: you're sad, but also happy for him now to start chapter two of his life. I learned a lot in 2014 alongside him, and even before that, you know, when I was a reserve driver and just being around the team and watching how he would work it was just always interesting. He had a lot of good traits and a way to get people behind him and rally but also, you know, be very direct and yeah, it was cool. Just a very, very driven individual. And, yeah, I think we'll obviously certainly miss him. But yeah, obviously wish him well, I mean, like, the simple thing was he was fast. But he was just a very in tune driver, very knowledgeable about the car, the team, the sport, he just lived and breathed it, you know, it was everything and he was just switched on. I know that sounds kind of simple but he just knew everything that was going on. So you could never count him out. And I think, yeah, just his knowledge of the sport and obviously his experience as well was, it was cool, very valuable to be in that environment. I think it was just a step. A step in terms of grip. I think we found a little bit more… I know it sounds general, but just in general, like this a little bit more and in places, like corners around the track, in general. It was just a step, a step in the right direction. Yeah, that's, that's the honest answer. And I think specifically, yeah, we know where we still have to improve. I don't think that's changed. I think we just got a little bit closer. Yep. Did you hear any of my interviews last week, Crofty? I mean, obviously it's nothing against that but, as I said last week, my future is clear and it's here. So, yeah. Firstly, nice t-shirt. Great show. Shout out to Stranger Things. I'm halfway through the very last episode. So it's a good one. Well, so far it is. (Laughs). Well, you know, this sport, it’s one of those ones where you're as good as your last race and in a way unless you're winning there's always something to prove, whether it's to fans, supporters or just yourself and I think most importantly it's first and foremost to myself. That's why I keep doing it. Because, you know, I still believe I can do it and do it at the highest level. So, always trying to prove that for me. And then, yeah, you can absolutely still find happiness. And, of course, this sport, probably more than most, is one, I've touched on it before, where your win ratio is so low, the percentage is so low, as opposed to a team sport, it's probably 50%. So you kind of have to deal with that and understand that you're not going to win every weekend but you can still set yourself other targets and other ways to certainly find happiness and fulfilment. There's no high like winning, but there are certainly still ways you can do that. So I'm still going through it and I am enjoying it. Of course, it can be an emotional sport as well and emotions around higher times and for sure frustration and things like that. But I still love it more than anything. I think everything's been said? It's fun. Obviously when it's tight it is fun, of course. It'd be more fun fighting for the wins, the podiums, but the battles we're having are good. The unpredictability obviously is not fun when you're on the other end, but it keeps it fresh, and it's cool when you get out on top. But I think because they are so new we're still learning and teams naturally design their cars to have some strengths in some places and others in… so like, fast flowing circuits, you know, you've got a couple of teams that are going to be there, and on the tight twisty ones, you know, a couple others. So now after doing like half a season, you have a little bit of understanding of maybe who's going to be where on what circuit, but there are still some curveballs, you know, some weekends where you’re still ‘OK, yeah, we still haven't completely learned everything that there is to learn yet with these with these cars’. So we'll keep going on and see how it goes. And as Esteban said, hopefully we can all be fighting further out the front. And that's really the dream, for everyone to have a chance to win or a podium, obviously, on merit but that would be cool. I'll go! On a beach, for sure. The first word that I thought was, life would be less chaotic. But yeah, I haven't given it any real thought. I think the biggest thing that we get used to is the schedule, you know, and always working to a schedule and a time. And you know, I think that would be the biggest change, I would imagine. I'm sure life for everyone would still be busy, you know, whether that's starting a family or whatever, but yeah, just the schedule that is in F1, and now with the weekends and how many races we have and other events and appearances. I think that's the biggest change. You know, I think everything would feel like it would slow down quite a lot. Yeah, I wouldn't go as direct as saying I wasn't satisfied. But it was more… I mean, ninth was decent, but it wasn't a race where I'm going to go out and celebrate Sunday night. But after actually looking over the race, and as you mentioned, the days that passed since Sunday, there were actually probably a few more positives than maybe I immediately realised. I think as well, you know, straight after the races. you're hot, you're still just feeling the race, if you know what I mean. I was having a good battle with Esteban and I was like, ‘Oh, maybe I can hold him off’. And then obviously, he got me. So yeah, just you know, being in a battle and not winning a battle obviously, I guess I would have wanted to hold on to that. So probably just a little bit, feeling the emotion of the race as well. But yeah, I think we did pick up some positives from it. I think we learned more about the new package. You know, that's one I touched on before. I think generally it's a little bit better everywhere, but I still don't think we… I think maybe Kevin was saying it, you need time with these packages, you know. You need to really execute everything out of it, or extract everything out of it, so yeah, confident that we can get a bit more this weekend, and then we'll see if this track plays to us or not. Maybe we'll see if he wants to continue! I don't know, he's certainly done a good job. Seb, he's a guy that, you know, a lot of the time just says it how it is. And I don't mean… That’s not in an aggressive way. He's just very honest and direct. And when we're on topics like safety then we don't need to beat around the bush. So I think his character is really good for that position. So yeah, we'll see. It's obviously very new news for us. So, yeah, I guess we'll discuss it internally and have a think about who's a good replacement? But yeah, he was great for us.",Hungary,thursday,McLaren
Alex Albon,"I'd say firstly, I maybe know him a little bit less than the older guys. But no, no, no, no, I’m not saying Daniel’s old! But I got to know him more and more, especially, actually, this year. You can see what he's been able to do on circuit. He's one of the very few multiple world champions. And there's a reason for that. And I think, as Daniel touched upon, you can see that he's switched on on the track, but also even off the track. And you can see everything he's doing outside of the sport is also equally very impressive and inspiring. I'm sure as he goes on into his ‘dad future’, he's going to look forward to that. But I'm also very interested to see what he does outside of that. He's just got an Instagram account I've heard, which is very exciting. So I have to follow him. Yeah, it's been a circuit that's gone well for Williams historically. Obviously there was a little bit of weather and carnage to help that last year, but equally you know in qualifying as well they've gone well. We've obviously got the new package which was going well in Paul Ricard. I felt like it was a good step forward for the team. Driving wise, as well, it felt better. And in Hungary you do need a good balance around here. It's not an easy circuit, it's very technical. So hopefully we can get on top of that early into the weekend. It looks like it's going to be wet on Saturday as well, which might throw a bit of something into the mix. And I think this weekend it's a little bit more towards qualifying and getting a good qualifying results and trying to hold on from there. So that's where the focus will be. I always welcome the rain, yes. Rain dances. Amazing question, as always from Crofty. No, obviously, Aston Martin, they're a great team. They're clearly expanding as a team as well. But, you know, the focus right now has to be on this year. And we’ll leave it at that. Yeah, I would say also that on top of everything it's just so new these cars, everyone's learning the cars. It's very hard at the moment to hit FP1 with a good car. It always seems like some weekends you nail it and that's the weekends that you're fighting, and for us that's more Q2, but at the same time, we know there are other weekends that are a bit more tricky. And that's why you're seeing this flip-flop of cars one weekend doing better than others. And if we knew why we would we would not be up and down as much, so it is a lot of fighting and as you see the philosophies are different as well. You know, there's maybe two or three standout differences in cars, I'd say. And I'm sure that plays a part into what circuits suit your car and what have you. It's good. I enjoy it. I think for us, as well, we want to be a little bit more towards these guys. But it's still good fun. I wouldn't say so. But I would say that you often have different compromises this year. So, you spend so many years with a car that you kind of build on. You know at these circuits that you need to do this and this with the set-up, because that's what it's been historically. This year, with such different cars, it's almost like a new slate where you end up driving and then you suddenly realise the limitations of the car and then it's always a response. I think the more times you struggle, let's say, it's easier then to figure it out quickly and bounce back strongly. You can almost understand when you do a tricky FP1, you can sometimes relate it back to three, four races ago, it felt a little bit like that. We need to do those set-up changes that we did back then. And in those ways you can bounce back quite quickly. But it takes time. And I think it's the first year of these new cars so it's a bit longer than normal. So for me right now, no, I’m not looking too far into the future, into retirement, I guess. But I'm sure you have to look at it a little bit. But not right now. But yeah, I’ll look for, I don't know, a cottage in the Cotswolds or something? That would be very nice.",Hungary,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"Well, first of all, I'm very sad to see him leaving. I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago and that's not the thought I had, you know when I spoke to him about his future and everything. So, you know, I hope he will enjoy retirement and that he will be happy with everything he does. I'm sure he will. But I think on our case, he was a great ambassador, I think of all drivers, and he has raised his voice you know, and when there was concern for our safety and for any sorts of things that he didn't like, you know, in regards to drivers, and yeah, on that regard I hope he doesn't stay too far away from the paddock. I mean, there's a lot of emotions, you know, that comes back. And a lot of great memories, you know, when I cross the gates with the Hungaroring banner coming in, doing the track walk, and of course you remember the good times that you had, that I had last year with all the team and yeah, what a time it was. It has flown, the time, you know, it's already been one year. But yeah, it's definitely one of my favourite tracks and Budapest in general holds a special place in my heart. Well, I've been there already. If you look at my Twitter account from 2018, it says Aston Martin Aramco, whatever! So I've been racing for the team, basically, back then. I'm good where I am, Alpine, at the moment, but yeah, I know the team very well and I know what they're capable of. She beats Vecna. Oh, sorry, buddy! I think it's been like that also in 2017 and ’18 really. You still had a top three teams and then the other guys, you know, fighting in the back. I feel we're closer to where we were from back then but it's still too far. And that needs to be closer to properly have a different podium, you know, different winners at times. We always see the same guys. So yeah, definitely the way hopefully is going to be forward for those midfield teams and I hope that with the cost gap and everything the same rules for a bit you know that the tunnel is going to close, you know, at the top. No, it’s still too far for me, hopefully. Yeah, I don't want to think about retirement at the moment. But yeah, I mean, after Formula 1 I guess you have so many cool series to try as well. So many different cars to experience. I see Le Mans is shaping up quite impressively at the moment with a lot of cool brands that are joining. Of course, I'm not looking at that at all. I'm fully into Formula 1, but that looks to be quite a cool series, I don't know, in 15 years or 10 years to try. I want you to teach me to rally. I think the hardest race to start with was probably Ricard on my side, so the last race. Why? Because it was so warm, actually. The whole weekend was very, very hot. And yeah, it is pretty tough, you know, to end the first part of the season. I think we're arriving into the summer break at the right time. I mean, we can see it on the faces of the mechanics, the engineers, you know, they start to have more and more holes around that part. So yeah, it's the longest first part of the season that we had for a while. And yeah, it's going to be good to recharge the batteries pretty soon, but yeah, the hot ones definitely are, for us drivers, the toughest races",Hungary,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"Well, I think, you know, as a legend of our sport. Before I came to Formula 1, he was certainly one of the drivers that I was really looking up to and kind of taking inspiration from. In the beginning of his Formula 1 career, he was, you know, very quick and successful. And he was so young when he was successful it was pretty special, and he dominated the sport for a long time. He’s a real legend. So, you know, I too wish him all the best for the future. I hope for a lot more performance, but with these upgrades sometimes it takes a bit of time to really understand the characteristics and the differences in the car, until you really unlock the full potential. You know, we've seen with the car that we've been running all year, we’ve just been continuously finding more performance. And, you know, I think also the other side of that is that the teams that have brought upgrades didn't seem to find all that much. So, you know, I think it's always exciting to see new parts on the car and it looks different and you're always hoping there's going to be a lot of performance, but I'm not expecting the big picture to change too much. So we'll see. Yeah, you know, I'm contracted for next year and very happy at Haas. Yeah, it's really nice that, you know… It seems like it's very close and every weekend, you can go into the weekend thinking that you can have a good result. You know, it doesn't seem like it's easy to fall behind too much. So I think it's better for us in the midfield, and I guess, you know, better racing as well for the people watching. Yeah, I mean, last year, kind of showed what that life is like. It was pretty good! I think it showed, you know… I came out of Formula 1 and I had a lot of things going on, you know. I was very happy that I had kept a life going outside of Formula 1 while I was in Formula 1 last time. I still raced, I raced a lot of things. I did Le Mans with my dad as a team-mate, that was a lot of fun and, you know, raced an IndyCar, raced at Daytona in sports cars and I had a lot of fun. That was for sure. And I didn't feel like I was missing out on Formula 1. But when I watched the races it hurt a little bit that I knew I wasn't going to do that again. So, you know, I think once I retire for good, then I will always miss driving these cars and racing these cars. I think it is really a massive privilege and last year kind of showed or highlighted how big a privilege it is. Once you kind of lose it and get it back, it's very cool to be a Formula 1 driver.",Hungary,thursday,Haas
Valtteri Bottas,"Always a really good driver to race against and to race with him. There's always a certain respect and you can kind of count on him that he's going to race hard but usually fair. So I really enjoyed the battles. And overall as well just such a nice guy, you know, to get to know and one of those drivers that is not afraid of speaking up about things, which is really, really cool. And he's really using the platform as well for the right things. So yeah, my respect. I really hope the French Grand Prix was like just a one-off dip in the performance. And we, in qualifying and in the race, didn't have the pace that we were hoping and expecting. I think the core reason it's not having much upgrades, actually, nothing since Barcelona and the teams around us they've been able to develop a bit more. We finally have something here. So I really hope that gives us a bit of a boost. I never believed I could say this, but I have a contract. I'm good. It's exciting. It's definitely like every single lap in the qualifying in the midfield matters, you know, you're either in or out of the next session and I'm enjoying it. The whole qualifying you really need to nail the laps. And it’s the same in racing, it's so close that it’s always good battling, good racing. And for me, it's also quite different in terms of the race strategy, how much more it actually matters in the midfield, you know, because we were battling with so many cars, instead of just one or two cars, which I maybe had in the past. So I'm enjoying it. And I feel it's a combination of the cost gap, but also the new regulations that are quite a lot more restricted in terms of what you can do. So it’s clearly working and I hope that, you know, the midfield teams will eventually get closer to the top as well. Also not really for me yet, but eventually, you know, I'm sure there's so many cool things, opportunities to do and yeah, but I don't think about it too much… Of course, we’ll do that! Rallying is good fun. For sure, after F1 I'll keep driving something that's for sure. Because I just love driving. The toughest one? Yeah, I think Paul Ricard was pretty hot. Even Miami was pretty tough. And yeah, I agree with Esteban, it’s good timing for the break. So we're ready for a bit of a mini-holiday after this one. I feel like it's quite hard to replace Seb in that kind of role, because of the way he is, you know. He's really straightforward and direct and doesn't go around things. He just says things as they are and questions many things loudly, so I hope he continues. I’m not sure if he's keen but it would be great if you can continue.",Hungary,thursday,Alfa Romeo
George Russell,"Thank you, I’m absolutely sweating, I’m a bit knackered now to be honest. It was a long race, a tough race. The pace was strong but we really struggled with the warm-up on that restart and Checo was all over me. But I was glad to see that chequered flag and come home P3. Yeah, I mean, I saw him struggling when Sainz got past and I knew that that one opportunity. For me, I was down the inside. The rules are pretty clear: it's front wheel to rear wheel when you're on the inside. That's what I had, he didn't really leave me much space. But nevertheless, glad I carried on, bringing it home P3 and two podiums for Mercedes. It's great. Yeah, it was pretty entertaining from those last final 15-20 laps, pushing as hard as I could to stay within reach. And then you know, do the overtake on Checo. I was pretty disappointed not to be able to keep that position. I thought it was my corner, I was down the inside I had my front wheels in front of his rear wheels. And to the letter of the law, it was my corner and he squeezed me a bit onto the kerb. He went wide and kept his position. So, I guess we'll talk about it after but nevertheless, you know, these things have a way of working themselves out and the VSC restart was pretty tasty. It felt pretty straightforward to be honest! I just gunned it when the lights went green, and got the run on him and went around the outside at Turn 14. You sometimes have to try and pre-empt it a little bit. And I think when you're on the race on your own, you're just playing it safe and you're leaving a little bit of margin. I just got a really nice run, timed it perfectly. I think he had to brake a little bit as maybe he was a bit too quick. So, with him braking ,with myself accelerating, it just gave us that closing speed. It was pretty sweet but those laps after weren’t easy. I think the gap to Max and Charles, they’re do an extremely good job, the two of them and we've still got a couple of tenths to find in race trim; we still need to understand what's going on with our qualified performance but as a team, we feel like we're making progress, we feel like we have a direction we can develop a car in now, and that’s something it took us probably a good eight or nine races to truly understand what makes this iteration of car go fast. So, I think we're excited for the second half of the season. I think emotions were high then, obviously for all of us, because I felt like I did a mega-move on Checo and ultimately didn’t get to keep the position. And we definitely had a bit more pace there, so, you know, I quite enjoyed hearing Toto on the radio, but ultimately, from my side, you're going absolutely flat out but… we're in this together, as a team. And when you're sat in the car, sometimes you do feel a bit alone, because we're in the car, we're doing everything we can, and you don't know what the engineers are looking at. The engineers don't totally feel what we're feeling within the car. And sometimes having these exchanges brings it a little bit closer together. I think it was difficult. We've made some good progress of the tyres this year, especially on the rear but when you're battling very close and the front sort of washing out naturally with the aero we really struggle and it's very difficult to maintain that performance for a very long stint. So as I say I think we've made some good progress, we need to keep pushing with the tyres to keep on improving them and allow it to battle harder for longer but as I say, compared to last year I think we've made a good step in a number of directions but we need to keep on improving.",France,post-race,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, I have to always give it up to this big crowd we have here in France. This is the biggest crowd I think we've had here. Merci beaucoup. What amazing weather we've had. That was actually a tough race because my drinks bottle didn't work. But what a great result, considering we've been so far off these guys all weekend. Reliability is one thing that my team has been amazing at, so a huge congratulations to the team back of the two factories, the team here who without them, we couldn't get this podium and George did an amazing job today as well. I don't know. I didn't see my weight just now, but I would imagine probably around three kilos. So, yeah, it's enough. I'm looking forward to downing the rest of this drink. I wish everyone back home well, I hope they've had an amazing Sunday. Budapest? Well, firstly, I love it in Budapest, I’m super excited to see the crowd there. And I think, I mean, it's going to be hard to beat the Ferraris and the Red Bulls. You see they have their pace advantage still. But I'm hoping we will bring some sort of upgrade to that track and hopefully take a step forward closer to them. And you know, you can see us in the race, we can at least lean on them a little bit. So hopefully in that race even closer. Yeah, I definitely do. Obviously I missed P1, but Nyck did a great job. And I think collectively as a team, whilst we didn't have the pace of the lead cars, we… You know, this is an incredible result for us, for George and I to be here. George did a great job today as well. This is progress, even though we're not necessarily closing the gap as such in race performance, in actual qualifying performance, but this is great points for us. And this is my 300th Grand Prix. Obviously, it was mentioned at the beginning of the weekend and I didn't really think much of it. And this morning, I woke up just feeling incredibly grateful, just thinking about all the people that have been with me along the way, you know. For Ron and Mercedes giving me the chance when I was young. Martin Whitmarsh. Mansour Ojjeh. Toto, Niki, just Markus… Who am I missing? Dieter… Just all these incredible people that have supported me since I was 13. To then have this just incredible journey with them, every race powered by Mercedes. And so very, very proud to be up here representing them, alongside George and yeah, we’ve just got to keep pushing. Every weekend we're hoping that we're going to get a little bit closer. This weekend, we somehow weren't as close as we hoped, but he was only 10 seconds up the road so that's a positive. Yeah, well, we both did. I think at the beginning keeping them behind was definitely tough, given their straightline speed was just impressive. So having to try and keep them out of the DRS zone was really the trick and then and then just tyre usage I think was probably key today. So yeah, I definitely don't think George and I expected to be second and third. As you said, this is the highest I’ve been all year. So this is a huge day for me overall and looking forward to taking this positive energy onto Budapest. If I'm really honest, I very rarely drink anyways in the race. I always forget. And I hydrated a lot already before the race, but just by lap 20 I was like “I really could do with a drink” and the thing just didn't work. And I haven't tried it for so long. Maybe it's just not worked for ages. Maybe the water evaporated, who knows? It's no biggie. Fortunately, afterwards I was able to have a drink. That's a lot of races! I firstly just want to be grateful to get to this point. But I still feel fresh and still feel like I've got plenty of fuel left in the tank. So, I'm enjoying what I'm doing. I'm enjoying… really, really proud and enjoying arriving every day and working with this incredible group of people. I’m also enjoying working with the sport more than ever. We've got some great people leading the sport and having great conversations about the direction we're going as a sport, so I'm enjoying it more than ever. I would say in that space, of course, I want to get back to winning ways and that's going to take time, but I'm sure we'll sit down at some stage and talk about the future. But again, just with our team, I always want to continue to be building. It’s one thing having races, but it's also continuing the work that we do outside and doing more, which I think Mercedes and us can always do more, and we will. So on one side of things… I've completely already forgotten the first one! Just with the rules, the rule change I think has been positive in many ways, however it's not necessarily really changed the order as such. If you look, there's always been two teams most likely at the front and there's been that middle-pack gap and even coming into these new rules, regulations, you've pretty much seen that same thing. So I'm hoping that the rules progress and improve and the teams can all be a little bit closer. Moving forwards it's been great to see the pace of the Ferrari this year. I’m gutted for Charles, who’s being doing a great job, as has Carlos. It’s not easy though, having that pace and that performance and maintaining it. It's a tough job and I feel for the whole team because I know what that can feel like. But they're a great team, and they'll continue to keep their heads down. Yeah, massive gaps, obviously pretty huge so that's pretty smooth sailing in that space generally. But a lot still can go wrong up ahead so I would just advise them just to continue to push. What was the other question? Oh, yeah, just in terms of our car. Well, the thing is, we're constantly just learning more about this car so everything that I'm working on with… you know, back at the factory, in the debriefs, trying to articulate how we're feeling in the car and the things that we want for the next year. And just with my time here, over the years, I feel I'm able to… I know exactly what I want in the car for next year that fundamentally things can't change, it's too big to change here with a cost cap this year, so I'm able to - ahead of time - say these are the things I want in the next year's car. So those things I think are being taken into account and whilst we continue to try and dial this car in, of course bit by bit, as we go into these next weeks, the next couple of months, the full focus will probably be into next year’s car. I was trying to keep up with Max. He was just so fast. I was kind of keeping with him for like two, maybe two laps and then… but literally I’m full gas down the straight and he's pulling away. That's, I think, the biggest… one of the biggest deficits was the straight line today. So if you’re losing four tenths, whatever it is, three tenths whatever it is on the straight this, there’s nothing you can do about that. So we've got to work to improve that for the future. And as I'm sure there's a couple other places that we could be better. But yeah, if I pushed any more maybe I wouldn't have seen the end of the race at the same position so I had to also keep in mind keeping the car in one piece and keeping the tyres there. This is the best result we could get. 100%. The beginning of the year was not miserable because there could always be way worse but just in terms of… I would say from a driver's perspective, understanding this car was… it was so confusing. We were trying so many different things, we we're trying to advance and no trust in the machine beneath you, particularly like the rear end. And that's really kind of held us back a little bit. So to now be in a position where we're starting to understand the car a little bit more, we've got more consistency coming up, we're seeing more consistency, it’s given us much more of an enjoyable drive. We still lack performance in some of those areas but we're slowly getting there. But it's like small chips, just constantly just chipping away at it. Unfortunately, you can't take big leaps at the moment. But who knows, maybe one big leap will come at some stage and we’ll be right there. Yeah, I remember it very clearly, 2009. I remember so many elements of it. I remember arriving in February or January I think it was, coming back from winter training and I remember walking along or being in a meeting with the guys and they're like, yeah we've already hit pretty hard our downforce target. And I remember back then they said that from their interpretation, it was 50% less downforce than the previous year. And they're like, yeah, we've already hit targets and I remember being wow, really? That means you've probably not set it high enough and I remember getting in the car in Portimão I think it was and it was horrendous to drive. It was the worst car that I had driven apart from the engine was good, but I was three wheeling everywhere, the wheel was coming up massively. So I remember the struggles of that year, qualifying 15th or whatever it was in the first race and then just continuously chipping away and I remember getting a big upgrade at Nürburgring and the radio… they only had one kit and because I was ahead on points, I think it was, I got the upgrade and I remember going through Turn 6 and 7, it was the first time we could take it flat. And I remember I accidentally had the radio on and I made this whoo-hoo kind of noise and they played it back to the guys back in the factory and then we got our first win in Budapest. This year, at the start a season, very, very similar when we were in February sitting down in the room, it looks like a glorious… the set-up… we’d got a lot of performance on the car, a lot of confidence, like, yeah, the car’s going to be good and then you get in the thing and it was bouncing and it's taken us a long time to fix that, taken a lot of performance off that car to enable it to stop bouncing. But I would say this experience is just an… it’s impressive to see a group of people just continuously not giving up, what you see within these teams. I think we haven't made that big step that we made in 2009 to enable us perhaps to win in Budapest but who knows. We’re not giving up, we're staying pedal to the metal. It's a hot race there. Maybe our car will be good, maybe we can be closer to these guys. I hope so, so much, because I love that track. So I hope the car feels good there. Well, I didn't really follow anybody. I was alone most of the time so. Oh yeah, we don't even get to follow really anyone so I was just in my own air. Fresh air, fresh hot air. Yeah, so that wasn't an issue for me. Obviously they were in more of a battle but just in general, it’s just very hot here in summer. And fortunately today they give us a little more time after the race to cool down which is a first so thank you guys.",France,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, I think we had really good pace from the start. I was putting pressure on Charles. But following around here with this heat, you know, the tyres are overheating a lot. So I could never really like go for a move, only once, into Turn 11. But yeah, we just tried to stay calm, tried to stay close. Of course we pitted a bit earlier. And yeah, from there onwards, you never know how the race is going to go. But the car was quick today. And of course, unlucky for Charles, I hope he’s OK. From there onwards, I just did my race, looked after the tyres. Because of the pit lane being so long you couldn't do another stop, so you had to stay out, but the tyres were wearing a lot. So it was all about just looking after the tyres to the end. I always just try to get the most points possible. And of course, you know, some moves, you see they are on, and sometimes you have to just back out and wait, maybe for the end of the race. And that's what we did. And I mean, there are plenty more races to come where you have to score points, so yeah, in that aspect, I think today was a great day. We still have a bit of work to do over a single lap especially, so we'll just keep working. Well, once Charles was off, I knew that it was all about managing the tyres to the end, because a two-stop was just slower because of the length of the pit lane unfortunately, which is a bit of a shame, because otherwise, you know, it opens up a bit more opportunities in terms of racing. But yeah, I just gradually increased the gap and I knew of course, the car was good today, we had good pace. So yeah, all about managing tyres to the end. We will never know because we cannot swap cars, but it looked good from our side. I was very happy because I wanted to see immediately if we could follow or not compared to Austria where it was the other way around, where you know, I was in the lead, but I could barely hold on. But this time I think we were a lot more competitive. Of course, our straightline speed was very beneficial, but because of that, of course, in the high-speed we had to be a bit more careful. And yeah, I stayed in his DRS for quite a while, but of course around here even driving on your own the tyres are already getting really hot. So I think by doing that, towards the pit stop, my tyres were a bit too hot. That's why I think he pulled away a little bit. But it wasn't anything, like, drastic, the way he was pulling away. So I still had good hope that we would have had a good fight on the other compound as well. I thought he would be faster, yeah. I thought it would be very hard to follow. But immediately, I could see that our balance was not bad. But again, it can also be just managing a bit, but it looked like we were very competitive. And that's of course what we like to see. Well, of course, I mean, it's a great lead. But a lot of things can happen. And I just want to stay focused. We need a lot more good results. We still need more one-lap pace. And I also think, you know, the next race, Budapest, I think that's going to be a bit more of a struggle for us, where I think Ferrari is going to be really, really quick. But we'll see. Again, it's all about scoring points, every single race even when it's not your day. They probably, of course, learned quite a lot but then also, you know, people are bringing upgrades and sometimes that also helps tyre degradation. Today, even with them sliding around a bit, they were still very quick in front of us. It just shows that they have a very quick car, and yeah, from our side we know that we have to find – especially over one lap – quite a bit of performance. But you know, we'll be working on it. I think, like I said, it's still, of course very important to always score points, even on a bad day, which we did in Austria. But yeah, of course the lead we have is great, but it's probably a bit bigger than what it should have been when you look at the car performances between the two cars. Well, difficult to tell. You can always make mistakes in the coming races as well but I think we learned a lot from that weekend. I think this weekend was a lot more competitive in the race but we had pole in Austria and here we didn't. I think we have still quite a bit of margin to improve with the car. Just need to keep on working, keep on trying to understand our little weaknesses and try to make them stronger. Yeah, I think on a track where it’s anyway hard on tyres and with this heat, you know, the tyres are overheating when you try to follow. You could see that, I think, the first few laps I was clearly faster but I could still not get past because the tyres… as soon as you get close they just went through the roof. And yeah, these are things we have to try and work on. I think in general the cars are a lot nicer to follow compared to previous years. The cars are not drastically oversteering or understeering, but yeah, with the tyres, overheating, of course, on some tracks is less of an issue but around here with this heat and rough surface plus the high speed corners it was a bit more difficult.",France,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"It's a great lap. I've struggled all weekend to put a lap together and I managed to put it, but I have to say that I also had the help of Carlos. And that was amazing teamwork, because without Carlos it would have been much more close. So yeah, a huge thanks to Carlos and I hope that he can join us back in the fight for the win tomorrow. Yes. But after Q1 I think I was very surprised by the pace we had, I mean, also in Q2, we were very strong. So somehow, we managed to turn that around for qualifying. But it's a good surprise. It feels good, it feels good. But again, it's difficult to understand what the Red Bull guys have done yesterday, because there was loads of difference in terms of lap time. So let's see how it goes. I was very happy. I mean, overall the weekend has been quite difficult for me. I struggled to find the right balance with the car, the right driving style, also it's very, very warm, so whenever you get a small snap or whatsoever then the rest of the lap is compromised. So it was very, very tricky, but I was very happy with my last lap. And obviously I got the help from Carlos also, that helped us for that lap too. So great teamwork and a great lap. Well, I mean, it's quite tricky to get it exactly right. I think the first lap, maybe we were a bit too close in eight, nine, and so I lost a little bit there. And I just drove not in the best way possible. And then in the second lap, we adapted that. And then it was better and that was the lap. So yeah, we did a good job communication-wise and also Carlos helping me was amazing. I think it will be tricky, because yeah, the Red Bull guys seem to be very, very quick in the race simulations they've done yesterday. So we've worked a little bit on the car for the race. Hopefully, it will go better for us tomorrow. But tyre management will be a thing. We were good in Austria, we struggled a bit more yesterday, but I think we did a significant step up in performance since yesterday so hopefully we can show that tomorrow in the race. No, we didn't practice before Q3 actually. So, we did quite a good job to between the first run of Q3 and the second run of Q3. We did a good step in the right direction. And for my driving style, no, it's all about… I mean, in all the tracks before you could play a little bit with the rear of the car and I always like this – but on a track like this, with such temperatures, whenever you have those snaps, then you lose later on in the lap. And throughout the whole weekend , that's been my problem: I was quite fast in the first sector, but then losing everything in the second and third. So, in qualifying is just about to do a clean lap. And it worked out in the last attempt. It's all in the trust in the end. I mean, I knew that Carlos was going to eventually get out of the way at one point, I just didn't know when. But yeah, Carlos judged it perfectly and got out of the way at the right moment. I think it's around two-tenths of what I remember in the car, compared to the lap of Q2 without the tow. So, it's significant. It will have been a lot more tight with Max without the tow. Yeah, it was a nice help anyway.",France,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Well, FP3 is not qualifying, clearly. But overall, I think we were lacking a bit in qualifying, just general grip. So it was a bit more tricky than I think I would have hoped. But overall, I think we still have a decent race car. And hopefully, of course, tomorrow will come to our favour, I mean, we are quick on the straight, so hopefully, we can use that tomorrow. Well, we'll find out tomorrow. I mean, it's also going to be a bit warmer, but clearly they've been really quick again. I didn't think about that, what to expect from it in terms of lap times. I think overall, you know, with the conditions out there, it's very difficult to really know what's going to happen. I mean, it's so hot out there. And also the tyres, to get them in the right window is very tough, already the whole weekend. But qualifying for myself was a bit of a struggle to get the right balance to be honest. Yeah, just not having that grip I want to have, especially in Q3, you know, when you really want to push it, but maybe it's just related to the track layout, the surface, together with the heat, that it just doesn't really, whatever, suit the car, suit my suit my driving style, I don't know. But I think, overall, to be second I think it's still pretty good. Yeah, that's the thing, right? I mean, you can start probably a bit warmer, but then of course, they will be hurting more throughout the lap. But finding the right trade-off for not being too cold of course, it's tough. I don't think it's 0.3. Of course, it's quite a bit. Maybe Charles can tell you more, exactly how much it is. But overall, I just look at myself, of course, you know, what we have done better. And I think overall, that final lap was, first of all, not a clean lap, just by being on the limit or trying to find that limit I just had like two moments, which cost me a bit of lap time. Those things, we have to figure out why they happen and how can we make it more predictable, let’s say it like that. But I mean, we still have two cars in the top three. So that's good. Yeah, it's alright. But I mean, we have to be quick also tomorrow and it's going to be probably even warmer than today. So it will be even harder on the tyres. And to keep them alive is going to be key. I mean, you can have good start pace but it's also about keeping them alive. No, I mean, we are both of course trying to get the best possible qualifying result. I mean, it's a bit different: Carlos is starting in the back. So, I think it was a smart thing to do. And probably if one of us, you know, had to start in the back, something similar can happen as well. Low speed grip for me, compared to yesterday. I hope so. I mean, yeah, we seem again very quick on the straight, which I think is, of course, a nice bonus but I think overall, we need to look a bit into our high speed performance. I think overall this, whatever wing we put on the car, we've always been struggling a little bit in high speed compared to Ferrari. But around here, I mean the tyres are going to be like incredibly hot tomorrow and you cannot push the high speed as much as you of course do over a Quali lap. So then, of course, I hope that top speed can help us out a bit more than over a qualifying lap. Where, of course, you also have DRS at some places.",France,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it's been a good recovery. I've been nowhere the whole weekend, to be honest. I've been struggling a lot. I think it probably has been my worst weekend up to qualifying really and finally we managed to recover well in Quali. Yeah, that definitely will be the target for tomorrow. Try to recover, try to beat those red cars. They were very strong today, certainly. Yeah, I managed to improve a few tenths on my final lap. I think the whole weekend has been very difficult for me. I've been struggling a lot with the balance throughout the weekend. I was certainly making good progress through qualifying and I think my Q3 lap, there was a bit in it still, but not much more. So super pleased to be P3 and hopefully our race pace will be stronger for tomorrow and we can be in the fight for the victory. Well, we've been playing around with the set-up quite a bit, you know, since the beginning of the weekend. It's very, very hot and somehow I've been struggling a lot, you know, it has been probably my worst we can up to now in terms of preparation for qualifying. So it's a decent result to pull it back. It hasn't been ideal. But with the changes we've done today, I think it's something that is going to help us and something that I'm more comfortable for the race tomorrow. Yeah, certainly it's going be a tough one. The circuit is not very demanding, but obviously there's a lot of heat. So yeah, it's going to be very warm. Probably not so much for a Mexican but certainly it will be very warm. The big thing is the tyres, you know, getting a good read on the tyres. I think, basically, 95 percent of your balance is dominated by the tyres, where at which stage they are. So, getting them in the right window, it can change your balance quite a lot. So, I think getting a reading in the tyres was very important this weekend – has been very important, especially into qualifying.",France,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Sebastian Vettel,"Correct. I don’t think you can go much older. Yeah, it’s going to be exciting, I’ll go right after this, to do a little bit of driving on the track. And obviously, it's a very different car but it's to celebrate the 100th anniversary. And it was the car that was competing in the first Grand Prix – not Formula 1 Grand Prix, because that was in 1950. But first Grand Prix, I think it might even have been the French Grand Prix, as far as I learned, so… Yeah, I am looking forward. We brought an update to Silverstone that we didn't fully get on top of yet. And maybe this weekend will help us to get a little bit more answers. So, exciting. And I hope we can be a bit more competitive, to get back in the midfield and therefore, a bit more back in the mix. The track’s what it is.  It's not the most exciting track in the world, but still quite challenging and technically demanding, and it's going to be very hard. So, we'll see what the weekend brings. Well, I'm racing this weekend, and the next one. Then, yeah, obviously I've said that at some point, we’ll start to talk. I'm talking to the team. I think there's a clear intention to keep going. And we'll see soon where we stand. Because we are trying to go as fast as possible. No? Is that not fair? Well, because, you know, I think if we were all taking it easy, then it would be easy, but we are going as fast as we can and mistakes can happen or sometimes it's very difficult to judge, you know, to judge five centimetres or 10 centimetres from the inside of the car where you don't actually see the lines. So I think given that we can't see much, we're doing pretty well. I think if we are out, and if we are really out by a metre or more, then I think it's something went wrong, but if we're out by a couple of centimetres still a very good judgement but obviously not good enough. I think Lando has a contract. No, I know some people there, but I think it's just rumours. Spa, because the track is amazing and it would be a shame to lose it. But in fairness, obviously, this track is not so exciting, I don't think many drivers are huge fan, at least behind the camera. But I think the crowd actually has been a positive surprise. Obviously we had one year where we didn't come, in 2020, but I think 2019 was amazing. The crowd and hearing the French anthem before the Grand Prix, I remember it as one of the, you know, highlights in a way, because the atmosphere you could really feel is there and the people are very excited and I expect a great race in this regard as well this year. So that would be a shame, but maybe we can move it to another place in France? There are exciting tracks. Yeah, I have. It's better than here. But I think it would be nice to go to some older tracks. Yeah, I mean, Le Mans has a lot of history. So that would be maybe a unique place. Could be a long lap, could be very exciting. Dijon, exactly. That’s the one I'm thinking of. I have been there, I think in a Formula 3 car. It's short but it’s quite nice. Well, I think it's always exciting to race in Hungary, at least from a drivers point of view. Racing? It’s difficult because it's not a track where it's very easy to overtake. I think this year will be the same, maybe we'll see a little bit more, but I think it will still be very difficult to pass just because of the nature of the track. But it's a big challenge. Last year was quite warm, the race. and I expect, if Europe stays hot like it is for now, then it's going to be a very hot and demanding race again. Well, first question, I'm very, very happy for Mick because, you know, I think he had a, maybe an unlucky start to the season and then, you know, it takes only a couple of races and then you get a lot of criticism and I don't think it was justified. I know how much effort he's putting in and how hard he is working. So I think Mick is on the right track. And it's great to see that he had the results that he deserved. So I'm very, very happy. And I hope for him that, you know, the car will continue to be strong enough for him to show what he's capable of. Second question: I'm not concerned. I think there has been… I don't know, obviously, I think there has been a shift in fan base. I think we can all see the excitement for Formula 1. I think we can see a younger audience, on average, coming to the track. And I think the abuse has probably always been there. But I don't think at any time it was or is correct. But I think maybe you are starting to see a generation coming to the track that actually stands up and complains about it and makes a noise and uses different platforms to communicate. So, I think it's great to see that people are having the courage to speak up and we are learning about these things going on, because only by doing by doing so we can take action. So I don't think it will escalate. I think the truth, unfortunately, is probably that it has been going on for a long time at all major sport events or big events. And it's more than about time that these things are changing, because there's just no space for those are for such things.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Aston Martin
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, it was it's only 60 kilometres away from here. Very, very good memories. I didn't come to this place very often, before being a Formula 1 driver. But it's always nice being here. And I hope we can have a good weekend. Yes. I was. In Brignoles, actually! Well, I hope so. It was definitely an important victory, especially for me. I mean, we've had five very difficult races on my side where everything felt to go against me. So, it was important to have that win, take some points back to Max. Considering for this weekend, we need to see, because the last two years have been very, very difficult: tyre management has been a thing and we've been particularly struggling, so we will put our full focus on that in free practices, in order to be ready for the race. I think the best probably, or me personally what I prefer was the kerb, because the kerb you could actually feel it. Sometimes last year we used the kerb as a reference for the track limits and that you can actually feel it on the steering wheel and also when you are on the limit of the kerb you can also feel it. So it's much easier to be very, very precise. With the white line we are so low that as Seb said, five centimetres out and you don't really realise it as a driver. So it makes it tricky. But I might think we just have to deal with it this weekend because there are no real kerbs here. So yeah, it's going to be tricky. Yeah, I don't know, for the character of the track, Spa, also for me. I mean, I prefer Spa as a track. But here I have these connections. I started karting an hour away from here. So yeah, difficult to say. Oh, you mean tyre warm-up, that Red Bull is probably better than us. Yeah, well, looking at Austria, I'm not too unhappy that we didn't follow in the first laps because it paid off at the end of the race and that's what counts. But it is true that they have the tendency to be very strong in the first few laps of the stints with the tyres. We know that maybe for us it's a bit more of a weakness. But at the end, you also need to look at the full picture, and the tyre management has been good in the last races for us, so we need to keep working. It doesn't mean they will be just the same this weekend. But overall, as a whole, I'm pretty happy in the way we manage the tyres. No, I don't think so. I have full confidence in the team. And I think we've shown after ‘20 and 2021 that we have the team to come back at the top then. Of course we've done a few mistakes in the last races, in Silverstone in Monaco, but this happens to every team and now we are a bit more in the spotlight because we are fighting for wins. And we always try and work on ourselves to get better. And we, for sure, need to get better. But yeah, I don't think there's a particular weakness there. I don't think he will change massively in Hungary. I think these cars are much better to follow for high-speed corners especially, but for the low speed it is not that different and Hungary has a lot of low-speed corners so I believe it will be quite tricky. I mean, the goal is still to win the championship. So yeah, I don't plan to lose any more points than what we already have. I mean, 38 is quite significant. Doesn't mean that it's not possible. Again, I still believe in it as much as I did five races ago. But yeah, we've done few mistakes. We've had some reliability problems. And now we just need to be perfect until the end of the season. And I'm sure that we can close that gap.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"I'm satisfied. I think… I guess every race is always what could we have done a little bit better and could we have scored any more points? But, in general, I think it's been a good run. We've been consistent, which is always a good help. I know things like the five-second penalty last weekend was, I guess, a little thing which made it a bit harder and maybe we could have had a good fight with Mick for a few more points. But, in general, you know, we've been doing a good job. We've been maximising our potential from the car. A lot of other people brought upgrades over the last few races and we've still been managing to stay there in the fight and getting the points that we need. So, been doing a good job, I'm happy and we'll try continue to that. I think it's going to be very tough. The Alpines, especially since the last… I mean all season I think they’ve been extremely quick. Fernando’s always been there fighting – for poles sometimes. So, they're fast. They're consistent as well and especially now, they seem on a very good run with a very strong car. So, it's going to be tough to keep them behind and keep the battle going. But we're motivated, we know we can do it. I think we've been showing that we, even with a car which maybe isn't quite as strong as them, we can still outperform them and outscore them, so hopefully, especially because it's their home race. We can get one up. Always does. I think what we were the opposite of Charles last year, we were very strong on tyres. So of course, we hope that kind of continues. And Paul Ricard, I guess for me, as a driver, has always been one of my better tracks. One I've always treated very well and have performed well at and been fast at, so yeah, let’s say it's kind of simple as it is, it's one I kind-of enjoy, especially just in qualifying, putting the lap together and so on: a good mixture of high-speed, low-speed corners. But the race was exciting as well, you know? Doing a different strategy, doing the overtaking in the racing, always makes your Sunday more entertaining. So hopefully, more of that again this weekend. No, I think they've said it well, it's just judging… Judging the exact position of your car within a few centimetres when you're going whatever speeds it's just not an easy thing to do, especially when you have wind involved or you're following cars and you hit a kerb or something or bump. Judging it so precisely is just a very difficult thing to do. And when you're sitting centimetres off the ground…. And especially with this year's car compared to last year's. Your first judgement is obviously a visual of where you can actually see the line and you can only see the extra racetrack probably like 10, 15 metres in front of you, that’s the first chance you actually get to see the actual track. You use that as a judgement but then you also just use your feeling of where you think you are. And when you're in the car, when you're reacting to things, judging things by such a small margin is tough. It’s part of it but it's tough. It's frustrating sometimes, like obviously I was one of the guys who got the penalties. It's nice when you have gravel because there's a limit there. If you're in the gravel you've made the mistake and you lose a lot of time. You have a sausage kerb at the exit of Turn 1 in Austria and if you go over it you lose time. But like the last few corners if you go off, you go off. So I understand it, it’s just you wish there was just gravel on the exit of every corner and if you go off then you're in the gravel and that's your penalty. Oh Spa, easy. I mean, my mum's from Belgium so I'm 50% Flemish. It’s as much a home race for me as it in Silverstone in a way. I personally have a lot more connections to it, of course, and I love the track and so on, I grew up a lot of the time or I grew up for many years going to Belgium and spending a lot of time there with my family. So, Belgium for me. I agree with Charles",French Grand Prix,thursday,McLaren
Nicholas Latifi,"I guess the simple answer is more lap time. Obviously, the past two rounds, Alex has run with the upgrades and I haven't and Silverstone was quite obviously tricky to kind of get any meaningful data on it. Obviously, wet qualifying, he didn't get to do any laps of the race. But Austria, there was some clear positive signs of what the new package was bringing. So yeah, knowing that I was going to be getting them this race was kind of just, you know, obviously try and maximise what we can. But again, we are still the… I was still in the slowest car, and it was just kind of getting through that weekend. And ultimately, there was no opportunities that really presented themselves. So, it was a little bit of a frustrating one, for sure. Especially when you lose the one real reference that you have, which is always your teammates. This week, now obviously getting the upgrades, just curious to see how it's going to feel. I mean, there is some feedback from the team and from Alex that I've been hearing, that might require, you know, a difference in driving approach; different compromises on the setup. So, I think from my side is just going to be trying to, you know, get on top of that, as soon as we can. Obviously, we do have an idea of where we have to pitch the car and myself going into it. I've been listening quite in detail to what the team and Alex has been saying about it. Hopefully it's just going to give us those few extra tenths that sometimes we've been missing and that, in some situations, like in Silverstone, probably would’ve made the difference between scoring points and not, So, yeah, it's a weekend I'm looking forward to for sure. I mean, I think the simple answer is like Seb said, because you're trying to go faster and if you don't try and push those extra millimetres or centimetres then somebody else will and you might lose a little bit. But yeah, I guess the first thing the driver will use is the kind of visual reference, and it does depend corner to corner, there's a lot of tracks that you can very easily see the white line from the approach of the entry to the corner. And there's a lot of tracks where you can't. I mean, naturally, if there's a wall at the exit, like on street track, there’s less track limits offenses, because you could see the wall from the entry often. So it is, naturally, as a driver, you’re taking much more margin when there's a wall at the exit, but you also visually see the wall much better, which in some cases, as we're saying, you don't often see the white line, whereas you could feel a kerb. And yeah, I just think there's some instances, some corners, where there is very natural track limits where, you know, there probably shouldn't be track limits for specific corners. Like, just in Red Bull Ring, for example, the exit of Turn 6, I think Lando maybe got a warning, was it in qualifying or a lap deleted when he dipped his wheel in the gravel, but he still went off the track. And that's one corner where I think all the drivers would agree that we don't really need track limits in that corner. Likewise Turn 12 in Barcelona, I know my team-mate got penalty points for doing that, which is a bit of an extreme consequence for just going a little bit wide in a corner where there's such a natural track limit anyway. So yeah, it is tougher than it looks. But again, it is kind of black and white now, and it's just tricky to manage sometimes. Yeah, I mean, like Zhou said, it's not up to us to decide. I mean, if I'm… let's say which track I prefer? Me personally, I have a lot of fun driving at Spa, more so than I do here, but that's a personal preference. But in terms of which one stays on the calendar or if it's one or both. I mean, again, that's not for me to decide. Yeah, I think in the bigger picture it probably won't change much. I mean, we've seen a relative improvement in the ability to follow compared to the previous years, but it has always been very difficult to overtake in Hungary so is that relative improvement going to make a difference? There's also less of a slipstream effect, less of a DRS effect this year, so it could balance out. But there's always tended to be quite exciting races there as well in the previous year so we will see.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Williams
Zhou Guanyu,"Last time out we struggled as a team; tried to get the balance right for Quali and then in the race it was very difficult to overtake, stuck behind AlphaTauris. this weekend, coming through, firstly with the temperature, the track layout is completely different. And for me, I think I never raced in such a high temp track and that could be affecting a lot tyre saving, and tyre management in the race could be playing more into our hands in a way, and in the past, obviously, in these hotter conditions, it seems to be like our car is performing a little bit better than the cooler conditions, so hopefully, we are able to get back to the pace we were missing last time out in Austria. Obviously the whole team. I think it was a tough one for me, especially in Spielberg, just because coming from Silverstone, and completely new chassis just have one session before the parc fermé qualifying rules. So, to get the balance right wasn't easy and I didn’t get it right straight away. This weekend could be a bit easier, just to get into that rhythm, and finding the right balance for me ahead of quali and the race. I mean coming from UK last weekend, I've been prepared pretty well! Kind of! But not, you know, around lunchtime. Luckily, I’ve got aircon in my house. People were suffering a bit more, but yeah, coming to obviously this weekend with the high temperatures, for us as a driver, you have to stay hydrated quite a lot. And normally I don't actually use the drinks system in the car and the only races I used it were Miami and Bahrain. So, I think I'm going to definitely put it on for this weekend. But these things, when you drink hot water, in the race is not a nice thing to do. But still, I think the whole weekend, not just for the drivers, for the mechanics in the garage, that will be very tough weekend, because I don't think it's often we have such a high temp. I mean, coming from the UK last weekend, I've been prepared pretty well! Kind of, but not in, you know, lunchtime. But yeah, luckily, I’ve got air con in my house, so other people are suffering a bit more. But yeah, I mean, coming to this weekend, with the high temperature, you know, for us as a driver, you have to stay hydrated quite a lot. And normally, I don't actually use the drink system in the car. The only race I used it is Miami and Bahrain. So I think I'm going to definitely put it on for this weekend. But yeah, you know, this thing where you drink hot water during the race is not a nice thing to do. But still I think the whole weekend, not just for the drivers, for the mechanics in the garage, that will be a very tough weekend, because I don't think it's often we have such a high temp. Yeah, obviously, I was one of the guys that got a penalty as well, like Lando. And it was quite difficult for me in Austria I was just trying to judge where my wheel was, because I was getting, basically, the warnings, even though I was thinking I was inside the track limit. But then yeah, you get stuck behind a car for almost the whole race. It was very tough with the dirty air. Especially in Turn 1, like sometimes I would go onto the sausage kerb. But you know, sometimes when you're on top of it, or just by clipping it, it is a matter of, you will be over it if you just riding right on top of it, just by clipping it you just get away of it, on the edge. So it's difficult to judge but I agree with Nick. I mean, it's kind of black white now. So I don't think we can change it in a very short term but you know, some corners, maybe they can reduce the restrictions on track limits that you don't gain that much like a thing. Yeah, I think Turn 7 or something like that. It's kind of, I mean, everybody takes exactly the same line and you don't get anything, there's no danger. So it's made life more difficult, especially when you do 71 laps in Austria following a car but apart from that I mean we all have to deal with it. I mean, because we're in France, maybe I’ll go for the French Grand Prix. I mean, it's really not up to up to me. I mean, I think Formula 1 has their own choice of where to go in the next few years. And it's also about the track, the contract they're running. So it's not really up to me. So I let the others decide which one they want. Yeah, I mean not much more to add. We race at tighter circuits, more difficult circuits to overtake, so I think probably the trend will stay the same and the following is a bit easier with this year’s car and it should be… overtaking is still possible.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Alfa Romeo
Pierre Gasly,"Well, bonjour everyone. I'm extremely happy to be here. It's obviously I’m very lucky to have a home race, because it hasn't been always on the calendar over the past 10 years, you know. When I got to Formula 1, I had the chance to have Le Castellet in 2018 and to experience the feeling of having my home crowd on a racetrack and… No, this year is potentially the unfortunately the last time we have a grand prix, it might not be on the calendar next year. So it will be important to enjoy every second of it. And yeah, it's another sold out weekend. A lot more fans a lot more support for me, and I really hope I can put a strong performance to give it back to all the fans here. Hopefully we can fight for pole position, we'll see about that. I mean, if we can fight with these two guys on my right, I'll be happy. That's the target. I don't think we are missing much. But it's extremely tight in the midfield and two or three tenths can move you up and down like seven or eight positions at the moment and we’ve just being slowly sliding towards the back of the midfield in the last couple of races and hopefully these upgrades can put us back in the fight and boost this important weekend personally on my side and I’m extremely looking forward to see what it brings in what we were going to be able to achieve. No, it's not really luck. We just need to be competitive. And we've been dead slow in the last couple of races and we’ve just got to be honest with our performance, it hasn't been strong enough. And we desperately needed this upgrade and now it's coming this weekend. And hopefully it can turn things around for our season. Well, I’m biased. You ask a French driver what he wants between his own Grand Prix or Belgian Grand Prix. I love France, I want to race in my country in front of my fans and my supporters and I will always support that Grand Prix before anyone else. I think what's sad is that on the other hand, Spa is probably my favourite track on the calendar. I've been growing up, watching F1 racing there pretty much every single year and it's such a beautiful track, great place for racing and I think at the end of the day, it will be a loss, a loss for us as Formula 1 racing drivers. For sure France will be my priority, but we'll be sad to lose Spa as well. That was so genuine! Yeah, fully agree with Lewis and Checo. I think, at the end we can also generalise what happened over the last few weeks, because I think we've always had a great community inside our sport and I think it's all our job, all our responsibilities, all 20 drivers, but as Lewis said as well so the responsibility of the media to forward the right message, share the true values of our sport and what we are trying to give because I think we as drivers are more united than ever, to share a positive message. If we see how many times we got together over the past two, three years, I think it really shows we're trying to bring positivity in our sport, and we can always do better, we always need to work towards that goal and that's what we are doing. Obviously, what we saw last weekend is sad, I don't think it represents the core value of our sport and the true fans and we'll be ashamed to associate all these real F1 diehard fans to the sad actions we have seen last weekend. So yeah, we need to do better. But I think it's the responsibility for most drivers, but also for all of you guys to share the right messages. I don’t think I could have answered it better than Fernando and Mick. I must say I love the track. Driving-wise it's probably one of my favourites, not a big fan of straight line because as a driver, you put a monkey in the car, you'll be able to do the same thing as you and at least in Budapest you really feel you're working, it’s really flowing, there's a very intense reason so probably one of my favourite tracks and last year was pretty hilarious to see Lewis lining up on the grid on his own, and a very different, pretty crazy race with the start and everything that happened. So hopefully this year, we can have another update entertaining race weekend there. Definitely agree with the guys and yeah, I think Lewis said it all pretty much. Everyone can do more and there should be accountability for such abuses. These things, I think, goes back to education and no one's kind of been educated to behave like that or treat people in that way. And it's not only in our sport in Formula 1, but I think it goes beyond that. As Sergio said, it's not like it's happening every weekend, and there is a trend going in that direction but these things, this obviously should never happen on track and if you behave like that you should be banned and not come back and simple as that. I think again put more people, more security, trying to bring more safety and make sure that everyone is safe around the racetrack and for any sort of misbehaviour or abuses that occur you should be banned for life. I think there's no black and white and it should be like this going forward. But then afterwards, using the platform that we have nowadays with social media, as racing drivers with the exposure that we have, the exposure of Formula 1, the exposure of all of you, all of you guys to use it in a positive way, to just share the values that we all have and the mentality and the sort of behaviour you should have for these sort of events.",French Grand Prix,thursday,AlphaTauri
Fernando Alonso,"Yes, yes, definitely. I think so. The car has been faster and faster in the last few months. We are quite happy with the performance. Reliability has probably stopped us a few times to score even more points. But as you said, the last six races we've been in the points and let's keep you know this consistency in the next few events. Obviously, we need some help from the top three teams in front of us but we already see one or two retirements from them. We saw in Austria that Checo had a problem. Few races ago, Carlos had a problem and Checo as well. So there is always that possibility of top five, top six available. And as we saw in Silverstone in the last couple of laps, anything that happened in front of you, the podium is just there. So yeah, I'm feeling positive. The second part of the season is quite optimistic from our point of view in terms of performance. And if we deliver some clean weekends, we will score big points. That's the aim. I think it's going to be interesting. I think we've been generally a little bit faster than them this year. But they are very strong on Sundays. They always deliver the maximum available and, you know, especially Lando is scoring points every weekend. So we just need to outscore them with the two cars if possible. And yes, it's going to be a nice fight, but I feel optimistic that we are a little bit faster than them. I would say France as well. I mean, I'm racing for Alpine, a French team and I have a… I have a very strong connection with France anyway. I won the championship with Renault and, yeah, I live in Monaco so it's much more convenient to come to Paul Ricard than to Spa. So yeah, France. We have very good memories [of Hungary]. Both places give me great memories, even in World Endurance championship and things like that. But as I said, you know, by two or three factors, I would chose always France. France? So yeah, what to say? I don't think that he changed much to be honest. He had the talent, already in 2007 and he still have the talent now with experience and he has been a tremendous driver, and a legend of our sport. So it has been always a pleasure to share all this time with him and back then probably no one thought that someone will be able to win seven titles as Michael. But yeah, the journey has been amazing and the team that they all build at Mercedes over these years, he was outstanding. Yes, congratulations for the 300 and hopefully another win soon. Yes, very similar comments. I mean, and these are very good point on social media, so we all need to be united on that and it's not just drivers, or promoter or teams. It’s between everybody to make this sport a better place. It's never enough but I think we're moving in the right direction for sure. Who knows? I think is going be nice to go there. Budapest always is a nice circuit, used to be a very slow speed circuit but it's not anymore I think. In the last five or six years, we see that all corners, they are quite a medium speed corners and there are not any more corners where the car is struggling that much. So I think it's going to be fun. Maybe this year, we are able to follow a little bit closer so the race action will be maybe greater than in the past on Sunday. So yeah, I'm looking forward so much to next weekend. Nothing more to add. Honestly, we've been answering this question now two times so I don't want to be repetitive but I agree with every comment and you know, hopefully things will get better.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Alpine
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, pretty good. I think we're doing… Each weekend we are improving our set-up and I think we're getting closer to the Alpine guys with each weekend and that's kind of where we are aiming to. Approach? No, I wouldn't say so. I think it's just a matter of being consistent with what we're doing. And I think we always pretty much start off with a good set-up, and right away I had a good session so I think that that's what we're aiming for here as well, or like for tomorrow, especially just to, you know, build the weekend from scratch well, so that we're basically able to be consistent, and know what we need to change and know what we have in our car, let's say. It will be very hot. I think that I can cope with it. So hopefully it will prove me right. And we'll be able to score some more points and have some battles out there. Yeah, obviously it's something amazing to see my Dad getting honoured for that. I think it's the biggest honour you can get in that state so it's great seeing it and obviously my Mum and my sister have been there. I wasn't there, I didn't want to kind of sit there being sick. I'm happy that I'm already better today. But yeah, it's very amazing to see and I'm so proud of my dad. Yeah, I feel like we should bring a German Grand Prix into it. But yeah, Spa is a lot closer to my home than the French Grand Prix. Yeah, I would probably pick Spa if I had to, but I would probably put a German Grand Prix into it. Nordschleife, yeah. Yeah, I definitely agree with everything that has been said. I think all kinds of abuses are not welcome in our sport and unfortunately, we still, to this day, find many different kinds of abuses. So I think it's not only us, but also on social media platforms that have to kind of control that better so that there's no space to allow that and allow it to happen in any way. Yeah, we saw a lot of action in the past so I'm excited going back there. It's always a nice track to go to. It's usually quite warm and it's a track where I feel there's a very low time to rest. It's a very continuous track, very continuous in terms of corners so the concentration level has to be very high for the whole part of the race. So yeah, it's I think it's a very tough race but very enjoyable. I think everything has pretty much been said but I agree with the fact that this should be done more like more security in the way that you're able to address it as soon as that happens. And I think that what has been said also is that this is something which should be unacceptable anywhere, not only in our sport but anywhere in society today. You would think everybody is educated enough to be above that behaviour because I think it's just disrespectful towards everybody out there. And I think we're in 2022 and we still have those issues so yeah, it's definitely concerning, and definitely something that we all can do more and address more and kind of protect everybody more.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Haas
Sergio Pérez,"Well, I don't think it will affect, but certainly there are some drivers that you can raise a lot closer than others. It was anyway lap one and from my point of view he clearly did a mistake. I was clearly ahead. And I think there shouldn't have been a contact. It is crucial. It's been really difficult. Like you say, two DNFs in the last three races, it's really bad for the championship hopes, so hopefully we are able to get in the run and start scoring those big points in the next two weekends before the summer break. We hope. I think Ferrari was very strong, they have been very strong. I think we are very close between us. But certainly Ferrari was the strongest car in Austria. So hopefully this weekend we are able to be in contention for the victory. He's been really fast the last couple of weekends, and they're certainly making a lot of ground. Especially in Silverstone, he was the fastest car or driver on that weekend. I think both of them are great. Maybe they can alternate one year and one year. Maybe that's a good option. But certainly, they both are very unique in a way. It certainly would be a big shame to lose Spa. I think certainly it's important. We all do our bit: drivers, teams, media, fans – there are a lot of good fans in Formula 1. Those that… they don’t represent us as a sport, they don't share our values and they're not welcome here. As simple as that. So I do agree that we all can do more. No, I think it will be, I think, definitely a much better race than before certainly, so I hope the fans get to enjoy it. I think it's very important we don't generalise because it's very rare from our fans that follow our sport to hear something like that. So we definitely should, hopefully, ban them for life. Don't welcome them again, because they don't represent who we are as a sport, and they don't share our values at all so… but at the same time we have great fans out there and with great values and I think a few fans shouldn't be able to even embarrass our sport like that.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I hope so. That's what we're all working towards. I didn't even know that. It doesn't make any difference? I feel great. I really don't know if I'm honest. Have a deep conversation, probably. I don't know. Just enjoy. Just make the most of time. Time is so precious. And I think naturally when you're a little bit younger, you feel like you're going to live forever and that you've got all the time in the world. And I would just say time is precious so just maximise every moment you get with family with friends, create memories, that’s the most important thing. And don't stress too much. Well, every weekend we are hoping to improve for sure. And I really don't know what to expect this weekend. We have things that we're trying to… We're constantly making changes to the car, the aero forces and everything like that. So, the aero surfaces. So I'm hoping that we discover something this weekend that helps us creep a little bit further forward. But in general, this has been a decent race for us. So I hope it’s the same this weekend. It doesn't faze me because I'm working towards getting that win. So I do believe at some stage we'll be able to compete with these guys. Whether it's this weekend, or in five races time. So yeah, I don't really think about that. I think more about the journey. The journey is the important part. I think we started off not where we want it to be, we've made progress, we started to reach a patch of a bit of consistency. Not a single person in our team has given up, and we've continued to push. So I'm really proud of the process and experience that we've had. It's definitely not the… Entering into season it’s not necessarily the one you would ask for but if anything it's been a really valuable lesson learned for all of us, and experience. I think we've sharpened our tools in lots of other areas. So that when we do get back to where I feel like we deserve to be then I think we will appreciate it that much more. It's been really positive to have some consistency come back in, as I was saying earlier, and bit by bit you're getting a little bit more comfortable in the car. And also with the direction where you set the car up… where you position the car, what the car will accept? Obviously it bit me in the last race with the crash in qualifying but otherwise, as I said, we're constantly adding performance, we're constantly progressing forwards and there's a lot to come in the next races. So I'm excited about that and as I said, in the last race we were only a few tenths off the lead guys in qualifying so I think slowly we're getting closer. The gap may be bigger in some tracks, who knows, but… in the last race, I was seeing it on TV, as I said, the battle up ahead, I hope that I get to be a bit more in the battle sometime soon. Honestly, I don't have a… Honestly, don't really… I'm not bothered either way to be honest. I would say Spa has the history, it has probably in the past has had the bigger crowd but I think they've just made amendments there as well so the racing is probably a little bit better there. But they're both great circuits and this is a beautiful part of the world as well. So I don't necessarily see a reason to lose either. Thank you for the kind words. Standout? I think it's difficult to say. Your first Grand Prix is always going to be one and the first win, I would say probably those two, or your homegrown Grand Prix as well. Maybe those three are probably the most standout ones, 2008 and 2007, just because it's the whole realisation of reaching your dream is a very, very surreal experience and it is always going to be your first – there’s only one first. And so just getting to the first Grand Prix in 2007… the amount of sleepless nights as a family that all of us had had, not knowing whether or not we would actually reach our goal, reach our dream, but never giving up nonetheless and being there so I think that's probably going to be the real highlight. I mean I am so… I'm doing the most I can. I don't know what else I can do. But I do think it's all of our responsibility to do something, not only us, the sport, those that are coming that write and report what is happening here, the sport wouldn't be what it is without you. And your words are powerful and you have a responsibility also to the readers to make sure that we're progressing and moving in the right direction. Formula 1 continuously needs to do more, all the teams need to do more. I think we are very close to getting this diversity inclusion charter going and I think it's still one team – still the same team – is not willing to engage but I'm grateful to see the other teams are willing to step forward and do the work. I don't think it'd be appropriate to name the team. We've gone back and forth to them and for some reason they don't want to but all the other nine teams have which is really encouraging. And in terms of… I think it's difficult to say who's necessarily been the strongest competitor, I think, because every time you’re with someone you're in a different place in your life so… I remember the task of being alongside Fernando when I was 22. I was so young mentally and of course, okay in terms of skill but it's a lot of pressure to go against a great like him so I would say out of pure pace I think… I always say it's Fernando and ability. We had some good battles, I wish we could have more and hopefully he's going to continue to race so hopefully we will have more in the future. Can we make sure that we don't have a question for all five? Every time it's so long. I love Budapest, it's a great city. I say it every year. It's a fantastic city, architecture is incredible. Good food, and we have a massive turnout of fans there. I've got a great… some of the most loving fan base there that from the moment you touch the ground to the moment you leave they’re with you all the way. We've seen that so far this year, so I hope so. Yeah. It’s a great surface, it’s such a wicked track. Well, firstly, I don't think we should just be saying this is Formula 1’s problem, I think it's all of us. And going back to when I mentioned that Silverstone, just amplifying voices that are not aligned with ours, who have undertones of discrimination, we should not be amplifying those voices. Because, they like to create a divide, just to be able to get their names in the papers so that's just a pointless exercise. I think Formula 1 100% should continue to do more. In the previous years we had the whole We Race As One thing, but that really was just a lip service that we're not… we need to do more. And I know Formula 1 and Stefano are really focused on doing more and definitely taking it seriously this year, with the last race. But we can always do more, everyone can do more. Every team, every company here can do more. It’s about accountability. God knows, there must be a thousand partners, I guess, within the Formula 1 organisation probably, or hundreds maybe and it's about accountability with all those. What are they doing in their space in terms of… everyone should be pushing for diversity, inclusion and the messaging that we all use with our platforms. We can all do more. I think football has done some positive things in terms of the announcements that are made before.. we just need to continue to take a stand and I think the more we project the direction that we want to go, hopefully, slowly, people will navigate on that route.",French Grand Prix,thursday,Mercedes
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, it's great to be back. I missed this place. It's always special coming home for the home race and yeah, I think the whole city is buzzing. I think everyone's happy to be back. Some great memories of this place. So, great to be back. No, it hasn't been too bad, to be honest. I got here on Monday and had a chance to catch up with some friends that I don’t get to see very often. It's been it's been nice being back. And now looking forward to the weekend. It's a very challenging track. It’s a lot of kerb riding, and so not a lot of margin for error on a lot of the exits where the walls are, so I think it's just getting into a good rhythm, having confidence in the car to ride the kerbs and attack the lap. Just the place. I enjoy driving; it's always fun coming here. Well, it's going to be be great to see some Canadian flags in the grandstands. And, yeah, hopefully a strong weekend and some points. Yeah, I’m in agreement with what Esteban’s saying: I think it's not just the porpoising, saying it's the stiffness of the cars. This year, you hit a kerb, or a bump, it's, you know, big shock to the body. I think that over the course of the season, 23 race calendar, you know, it adds up. But as well, I think the porpoising does need to be addressed, I think this year, at times, it's been, really, really bad and, you know, very, very rough on the body. And I think, you know, both porpoising and stiffness is something that the FIA needs to address. And we need to think about going forward, because it's not sustainable for 23 races and then looking at the future with these technical regulations. If it's going to be like this every year, I think it's rough on the body.",Canada,friday,Aston Martin
Esteban Ocon,"I'm very excited. It's such a great place, obviously, one of my favourite tracks, one of the old-school ones that remains in the calendar and that's pretty special. And we have also a big French community in Montreal, and it's great to see the support, from the city. Not only in the track, but also in the city. And since I landed, I saw so many supporters and it's awesome to see that the city transforms completely to racing mode. Yes, definitely. I think we had a bit more pace than where we finished in Baku. I definitely think there was more in the car than what we showed, but yeah, the aim here would be to score some good points and perform well overall. It’s different challenges for sure. We were flying in a straight-line last week, a bit less straight here. I think it's important to be confident, riding the kerbs here and feeling the grip overall. We haven't been here for a long time, so there's a lot to discover with these new cars but yeah, different challenges; we should be competitive; there's no reason that we can’t perform. In my opinion, I think, we're not as bad as some other cars. You know, as Charles was saying, some cars are easier to drive than others, it seems like. But, you know, what's very positive is that, you know, the FIA is taking action in taking care of us and that's a very positive thing. There are two sides of it I think that we shouldn't mix. There’s the porpoising thing and the overall stiffness of the cars, because in some corners, that had already last year, for example, Monaco, after the tunnel when I hit the kerb badly, I did feel it hard on my body and that is not, you know, an end of straight thing or something like that. So, the stiffness of the car in general is also a problem. It’s not necessarily how much porpoising you have at the end of the straight.",Canada,friday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I missed a flight! But it's okay. I mean, I've been quite lucky because there was another flight an hour later, so I didn't lose too much time. Well, in the pace. The pace in general is the positive. We cannot hide obviously, it's hard to take: three races in a row with problems or mistakes – but as a team, I think we are working extremely hard, the pace is there, which is the positive to take and we’ll keep working, to try and get on top of those things as quick as possible. I think I don't have to give any message. I think it's clear for everybody the motivation is still extremely high. We are still working extremely hard as a team and we just want to get back to winning as quickly as possible. For the issues that we've had, we are working on them, and hopefully we will fix them as quickly as possible. Yeah, it does. But unfortunately, we don't score any points on the Saturday! So yeah, the Sundays have been a bit more painful this season. But yeah, I can see some positive again. The pace on the race days since Barcelona has been good. Unfortunately, we couldn't show it at the end. But it's a matter of days before we can finally show it, I’m sure. I don't completely agree, on my side. I felt like it’s the team's responsibility to give me a car that is okay to drive. Until now, I didn’t have any particular problems with it. Yes, it is stiffer than last year's car. Whether it's undriveable or very hard on myself, I don't think it is – at least personally. So, on our side, we found solutions to how to make it better. I'm not sure to be honest. This I don't know whether it will be the case or not. For me, it's not still very clear exactly what's going to change in the future. So yeah, I don't know. Well, obviously, we are not in the best situation possible – then for the power unit change, I think there are still ongoing discussions. We'll try and push as much as possible the decision, so for now, no decisions are taken. But yeah, it's not the best situation to be in. Well, I think again, this is part of our discussions and it's up to us to choose the best track where you want to get a penalty – if you get a penalty. And this is one of the tracks where it's actually quite easy to overtake, but they're also some of the tracks in the next three or four races where it's easier to overtake too. So yeah, again, we'll discuss and try and take the best decision from there. Yeah, I don't know exactly which data has been taking. But it's clear that when you look at Lewis, by example, getting out of the car after Baku, it doesn't look nice – but again, I think we should be careful and take data from various cars. And then and then see, because I don't think it is the same for everyone. And again, if when we race our car, at least, it is okay. I think we need to be careful to that, and see with whatever the problem is in different teams, and try to understand how bad it is from one car to another. I like the way the car handles. I like the balance of the car through cornering. It's a bit more of a pointy car this year. The rear is quite a lot more moving around. And this seems to fit my driving style a little bit better. But yeah, I'm sure that it's only a matter of time before Carlos gets at ease with this with this car.",Canada,friday,Ferrari
Daniel Ricciardo,"You beauty! That’s probably the best way I can answer it. Yeah. That's awesome. It's obviously such a long-term contract as well. So it's really encouraging. And seeing as well, F2 and F3 are going to go there. I think that's one thing the Australian Grand Prix has done so well is, I guess, is fill up the weekend. There's always action on track. There's always things going on around Albert Park, and now with the addition of F2 and F3, I think that's really cool. So very happy, very happy. It could be a stretch. I don’t even know how old I’ll be then. It's good to know that if I am, then I'll be home. It’s definitely a better weekend. I think it was certainly smoother. I think it was good just to see how we came out of Monaco and the work that was done since Monaco, we really kind-of translated well onto the track. And everything we felt like we'd found or understood, I think we certainly showed that, or at least good signs of that, on track in Baku. It’s also not an easy circuit as well, obviously, with the nature of it, low downforce street circuit. So, to have a solid weekend there was encouraging. Just good, building blocks moving forward. Yeah, I mean, in the end, it was, simply putting it, I had the orders early in the race, and then Lando had them at the end, so you could say it evened itself out.  I think in the moment, in the race, if you're the attacking car, you obviously want to charge through, and try and try and get on with it. But these are also things that we talk about in strategy meetings, things like this. We're aware that this could happen during the race and also, in my experience now, like full trust in pit-wall. And they see the big picture of how the race is progressing, I guess. So, yeah, it all worked out alright in the end. It's been fun. I still remember the very, very first lap I did here with Toro Rosso, when I was doing FP1s, and we did the install, and already on the install lap, I remember coming back, and I was like, this track looks so fun. So, it was just a place I loved really from the first lap I drove around it. And yeah, it's got a lot of character. As Lance describes, the kerbs and everything, you can really… some parts on the track feel like… remind me of go-karting where you really throw the kart around and try to chop off the corner as much as you can. And yeah, this circuit lends itself to that. Not much further to add. I think for me, Baku was the bumpiest ride I've experienced this year. But up until then, we were a little… I would say better off with it. So certainly not experiencing as much as some other teams. You know, watching the onboard, you can see, it certainly doesn't look fun at times. So yeah, obviously it's such a short turnaround. I don't know how much that comes into play, of having just a few days between races and how much we can do. But yeah, obviously open to seeing what we can do, moving forward. That's all. It's a long way away. I think it's so hard to…  I'm sure we're going to be much further down the road by the end of next year with all this kind of stuff, and regulations and whatever. But yeah, I mean, I don't wish for the speeds to be lower in terms of … like, it's fun going fast. So, I'd rather we just set the cars up differently to be able to still go fast and have long straights. And I think they also encourage overtaking, you know, with bigger, bigger tows, slipstreams and all of that. So yeah, right now, it's not really… I wouldn't say I'm concerned a year or 18 months removed from it. Yeah, I think it's probably one of those ones where: is it an unnecessary risk? That's what we have to, obviously, answer. I think we take many risks, getting in the cars every weekend and it's part of what we love about the sport as well: going fast and putting it on the line and trying to balance on that fine line of risk and reward. But this one, obviously what some drivers are experiencing, it's not who's the bravest, it's just, you're going down the street holding it flat and it's just how… you've basically just going to hold on for the ride. So it's a risk I guess out of our control, if that makes sense. So yeah, I would… hearing some of that feedback, that you've that you've gathered. I'm not really surprised in terms of all that, because it is, it does. I mean, I felt it in Baku and obviously watching the others, it does… like it is quite real. I think the position we sit in as well, we're not really braced for these impacts. We’re kind of curled over, so we are probably a little bit vulnerable with our posture. But yeah, I think there's enough probably risk already in the sport.",Canada,friday,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I've only raced here once. But it was a good experience when I was here. And there's so much character, very unique, got the street circuit vibes and the kerbs and the track evolving so much. And I remember the fans just being so enthusiastic. This is the first race I actually had goosebumps when I did the drivers’ parade, because of the fans were just so upbeat and pumped up for the race. So that was pretty special feeling back then. When you get to the race weekend, everybody's so focused and you're ingrained in what you're doing; trying to find more performance and it's no secret that, as a team, we're going through a bit of a tough time and we want better performance, but you need evenings like we had on Wednesday night where you get away from it all, and you just do something normal. We were at the restaurant, probably 100 people there, and it was a nice evening. Yeah, we'll have to wait and see. Obviously, it was a bumpy ride for us and for many, many teams in Baku, and obviously there's been some changes brought forward from the FIA. So, it's sort of pleasing to see that they've been on the front foot there. But we need to see if it actually makes any difference at all, and then go from there. I mean, I don't… I'm not a technical expert. So, I don't really know if that's going to improve things or not. But I think we, definitely as drivers, it's good to see them on the front foot and actioning something straightaway. Yeah, as I said, firstly, what's been brought forward this weekend, I think it's probably more of a sticking plaster than the solution. And we need to wait and see, I think, for even the teams suffering the least, it's still an incredibly aggressive and bumpy ride. And you know, the FIA have access to all of the vertical acceleration loads we're going through, and it's far beyond what you'd expect is safe to deal with – so I mean, bigger conversations are definitely needed moving forward and where we go from here. No, I don't think it's going to be make a big difference to be honest. I mean, yeah, I'm not too sure. There's quite a lot going on, to be honest, but no, all good. I think, Alex Wurz and Anastasia [Fowle] I think we're definitely hoping to have more performance in Silverstone – but definitely, really excited to go there: home crowd, to have a chance of fighting for a podium. And I think Silverstone is always driver’s favourite. Not just for the circuit itself but all of the fans there, they’re so passionate for the sport. Hopefully the weather holds off – but yeah, all in all looking forward to it. I mean, from everything you've said, there's not really much more to add. And there's obviously a lot of mixed agendas here from different teams and drivers. And we've heard it from Carlos at times, and Checo and Max earlier in the season, how bad it's been. But now that their performance seems to be strong, they obviously don't want changes because it can only hinder them. So it is obviously a bit of a shame to see performance prioritised over safety. But you know, there's no doubt in Baku, I could see my pit board, but I couldn't read my pit board because I was bouncing around so much. I think I saw a video of Lance on one of the laps, struggling to change the buttons on the steering wheel, because you visibly just saw how much the car was shaken around, how stiff it was, and everything. So, you know, we're all competitive animals here in this sport, and we all want to win. But yeah, we can't put our bodies at risk before any of that. Yeah, I think, as we said before, from our side, from a performance aspect, having any changes is a total unknown. At the end of the day, the FIA are the rule makers, and they could bring in any regulation change they want. And nobody sat here knows if that's going to improve their performance or have a negative effect on their performance. So, we really have to see: there's so many different aspects and elements of these cars, that by raising the car, doesn't necessarily reduce it or remove. You're going in between porpoising and bottoming: it's two sort-of different issues at play here. And obviously, the stiffness of the cars are really bad, but I mean, time will tell. It's…  I hope it's easier to drive for everybody and it doesn't have a knock-on effect for performance for anyone.",Canada,friday,Mercedes
Nicholas Latifi,"Yeah, it's definitely a very special feeling to finally have the opportunity to be here and get to experience my home Grand Prix. You know, I've obviously driven in a few FP1 sessions here but I think coming here as a race driver, and once I finally drive past in FP1 session is going to feel pretty special. I mean the last few years… I think it goes without saying that it's been pretty frustrating and disappointing to have missed this race, not only because it's my home race but I think it is really one of the best races on the calendar. So yeah, to have the opportunity to be here now, it's just a very, very special feeling. Yeah, I do have a special helmet. And yeah, I think naturally, at any driver’s home Grand Prix there is, for sure, a bit more going on in the background. I flew straight from Baku so I've been here since Monday evening. We have tried to get some media stuff and commitments done before Thursday, just to kind of lighten the load a bit throughout the weekend. In reality, I'm just trying to treat it the same as any other race. In reality this race is no more important than any other race. For sure there’s that special feeling of being here and having that home support? I know I'm going to have so many family and friends here. A lot of them wouldn't have even been able to come to any Formula 1 races so far in my career so yeah, it's obviously pretty special. But I'm just going to try and keep it business as usual once I get on track, Yeah, many, many times. To be honest I don't remember the first year that I came here. I was maybe like seven or eight years old, something like that. And I think since then I've only missed the Grand Prix once in 2012, when I was in Italian Formula Three. I just happen to be racing on the same weekend. So yeah, even before I started racing, it was always kind of like the first weekend off after school is done, you know, come over here, make it a family weekend, reuniting with a lot of my family that still lives here in Montreal. And yeah, it was always just a very enjoyable weekend in the summer, well to kick off the summer really, the summer break so it's pretty cool to be back. Yeah, I think it's always been one of the more kind of technical tracks. It's very old school which is cool because we don't have a lot of them on the calendar anymore. I think this track - specifically the curbs -  has always been quite a unique aspect here in these fast chicanes. Nowadays all the new street tracks on the calendar are very similar curbs, all the permanent tracks, very similar curbs. And this is one that has still kind of retained, I think, a lot of its character and that, I think,  is going to add a challenge especially with these new cars that don't like curbs at all. At least that's for our car. So yeah, it'll be interesting, for sure. Yeah, I agree with all that's been said. I think, you know, if you look to the next three, four years, if these were the kind of cars with the bouncing and you know, harsh ride that a lot of guys are experiencing, it's for sure going to have longer term negative health effects so I think, yeah, the intervention from the FIA is good. I think there's going to be the specific teams and drivers that are maybe happy to deal with it at the expense of gaining more performance versus some that are not as so for sure there's going to be some people happy with the directive,  some people not. But yeah, I do think it was a good thing for the FIA to intervene. Yeah, I agree with what Pierre said. Yeah, I don't think it was the wrong direction that F1 went into.  I think, yeah, the, let's say, porpoising that's returned now (with) the reintroduction of ground effects cars,  yeah, maybe it wasn't anticipated, how extreme it's been and how it's, let's say, you know, just a very negative feeling from behind the wheel. I think with a whole new set of regulations, a whole new generation of cars, there was always going to be, let's say, maybe some growing pains, if that's the right word. So I think it is a lot of obviously very, very smart people, smart engineers, working in Formula 1 and obviously a lot of smart people working for the teams so I think, yeah, with the new directive over time, whether that's by the end of this year, going into next year, the coming years, I'm sure there will be solutions that will be found to still have performance and yeah, mitigate the negative effects for the longer term health of all the drivers.",Canada,friday,Williams
Pierre Gasly,"It's been quite a busy time, yeah, we were actually quite busy with Max. Red Bull always manage to get a lot of activities into… yeah, always keep us entertained, let's say. So yeah,  we flew back to Monaco with a nice day in Monaco on Monday just to recover. And I flew to Austria on Tuesday where we got to drive a Formula 1 double-seater. This was my first time driving these cars, taking some passenger and scaring them around Austria which was pretty cool. Also driving a V10 engine which I must say I really enjoyed and really liked. It was from ’98. No, the one they had in Australia. The one they had in Australia this year, the double seater. I can't actually remember but anyway, it was very pleasant experience. It  was only nine laps so it was pretty short and then we flew straight from Austria to Canada, but oh yeah, quite busy. We managed to be in three or four different countries in 48 hours so it was quite intense. No, no, no, this didn't happen. I tried to take him behind. He wasn't keen. I tried to get Helmut  in the car behind me but h wasn't keen either. I wonder why. But no, it didn't happen. Well, I think we were just, yeah, more competitive and yeah, definitely faster there. We didn't do any mistakes from FP1 until the race and yeah, this was positive, you know, we just did a good job from FP1, good strategy, and yeah, just maximised our weekend. Yeah, we should be, we should be.  We'll find out in the conditions, in the rain and the dry but I think she'll be good. I'm not too sure who we are talking about…  I'm terrible with names. I've always been terrible my whole life, so I need to double check. Well, personally, I don't think they took a wrong turn. I think it's just some of the side effects we are getting at the moment are probably slightly more extreme than we expected. And I think it’s just fair to look at some options, look at all the solutions available to find the fairest treatment towards all the teams, but just to consider we should, probably as drivers, not been put in a corner where we’ve got to trade between our health and performance, because obviously we're racing drivers, we will always go for performance every single time. So no, I think they did it clearly, didn't take a wrong turn. But it's just finding the right compromises going forward and as you say, like for sure with the ground effect, that's the way it works. But I'm sure there's other ways to find more performance so we could be as competitive but just having that fine margins that gives us the availability to stay in shape over the next 10/15 years so yeah, just for probably some of the guys, not going to be here in five to 10 years, but also the young guys coming now, it's probably  clearly something that needs to be to be addressed. And just happy to see there is some action, a plan to move forward.",Canada,friday,AlphaTauri
Sebastian Vettel,"It’s getting a bit better. We didn't have any new parts in the last couple of races but I think we've been able to experiment a little bit more with the setup and tuning it a little bit more,  understanding more where the car wants to be because, you know, bear in mind that in Barcelona it was a basically brand new car and no experience with that car yet. So yeah, I think we still have some ideas for this weekend that hopefully help us to be again competitive and, you know, fighting that midfield.  It’s very close, you have Alpine, Alpha Tauri,  Sauber or the Alfa, ourselves and if Williams has a strong weekend they can also be in the mix so it's a tight, tight field and if we manage to find a little bit of extra then immediately starts to start to pay off and look better. So let's see. I like the track and hopefully we have a nice, nice weekend. Well, I think we need to be realistic as well. Finishing in the points for us is a major success. Obviously, we had two positions that we benefited from in Baku because of the Ferraris not finishing. But yeah, I think if we can get in that range, if we can qualify around P10 and then race there as well then I think that's good for us. You know, you have already four positions completely locked at the front, and then another two with a Mercedes that are usually ahead of the midfield. And then you have those four positions left. I think McLaren will be stronger again. Maybe Baku wasn't their cup of tea. Maybe they will struggle a bit here as well with the big rear wing they have. So we will see. But yeah, it's not going to be easy, but we will fight and try to squeeze everything we can I won last time around here, at least I felt like it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm over it so clearly, as you can see.  No, I think it's always been a good place. I liked it, enjoyed it here, it's a rough place. It's like others said it's technically demanding and with the curbs can be quite harsh. I don't know how this year’s car will perform or will like it or this year’s cars in general. But yeah, I think it's a circuit where the driver can also make a difference. So let's see what we can do. No, nobody's contacted me. I do a lot of reading on the subject because I find this… fascinating might be the wrong word but there's a lot going on. And I think we live in a time and age where we are so much aware of a lot of things. I think, you know what happens in Alberta is a crime because you chop down a lot of trees, and you basically destroy the place just to extract oil. And the manner of doing it with the tar sands, mining oil sands, mining is horrible for nature. And obviously Canada's greenhouse gas emissions also have gone up since they started doing it. The site has only, I think been, as far as I read, founded like 20 years ago. I think the prime minister said that no other country would find these resources and not take them up. I think in principle, you know, every country and every person has their opinions and their stance. My personal opinion is I disagree. I think, you know, as I said, there's so much science around the topic that fossil fuels are going to end and living in a time that we do now these things shouldn't be allowed anymore, and they shouldn't happen. So I think it's just in principle to raise awareness of what's going on in the first place. I think a lot of people in Canada,  a lot of people around the world don't know about it and yeah, that's only a small gesture. We'll have a special helmet as well this weekend, highlighting the fact and yeah, I think, you know, it's just to think about future generations and the world we leave in their hands once they’re old enough to carry on, to take care of it. I think it's only fair to look after it and not destroy it. Yeah, I think it’s good.  Obviously it will be very difficult to foresee now what the solution is, for everybody. It will be impossible for all the teams to agree either. But, you know, it cannot be that as drivers (we) will suffer injury short- or potentially long-term, and suffer for the rest of the life for stuff that can be avoided. Not every sport practised to the extreme is not healthy to some degree but yeah, I think, you know, looking at the future it can't be going on for another four or five years like that. So it's good that the FIA starts to look into it and, you know, put safety over performance. Well, I think it’s important to use…  to realise that you have a responsibility or you have a platform to communicate, to reach people and you know, if you want to sell stuff then you have a platform and it probably allows you to make money but I don't think ethically that's a really important thing, that those are not important things. But when it comes to human rights or equal treatment, I think those things are big when it comes to the climate crisis, which affect every one of us already today. And more so in the future, I think those things, you know, are more important than anything else and therefore they deserve to be mentioned and deserve to be addressed and trying to reach people and raise awareness. Why are they important to me? I think it's just fair, it's just the right thing.  It naturally feels like the right thing to talk about, and to express my support for people who suffer from prejudice and just because maybe they fall in love with another man or with another woman, or because they are different, you know, coloured skin. So I don't see why these things should matter. It should be accepted, just like a lot of other things are accepted. So yeah, it feels like a natural voice that comes out to talk or to speak up. Well, I think the objective with the new regulations of the new cars was to make it better so I think the turn has been right. Obviously, we still have to see the bigger picture over years to come, whether it has been the right direction or not, but we are able to follow each other closer. Obviously, the cars have less drag, which means we have to follow closer as well otherwise we won’t make the overtaking. We still rely on DRS. Ideally, we find a set of regulations where we're not relying on any assistance to overtake but let's not forget where we are coming from. I think in the bigger picture, with these cars and regulations, we just need to find a way, as I said before, for no upside with the porpoising that we suffer other than a little bit of performance. And there's no upside to the sport. And there is a lot of downsides for us driving the cars when it comes to comfort, health long term. And therefore I think it's good that the FIA is trying to have a look and we will see in which form they are going to intervene. Fernando says yes, I say I'm not sure. How old are we going to be in 2026, Fernando? Now you are? I’m 34/5, so in ‘26, I'm going to be your age and you're going to be a little bit older. So we should both keep going. So let's think about it. I don't know is the answer. I mean, it's a long way away. Yeah, I'm very much looking at this year, and then the next year rather than 2026. But I think it's good news that there's talk of new teams like Andretti and big manufacturers coming in. F1 seems to grow in popularity so who knows what the sports going look like in ‘26. But yeah.",Canada,friday,Aston Martin
Fernando Alonso,"Well, not much. I just visited the team here. It’s the first time that you know I see any arena of ice hockey.  In Spain I never saw on TV or I never put the skates on so yeah, I cannot comment too much. Yeah, that's cool. It is good. Montreal is one of those places that everyone wants to come to. It's a fun city. It's a good weekend normally, a lot of action on track. The walls are very close,  the exit of the corners. The weather can be a big factor as probably also this weekend, and yeah, the whole city seems to embrace the event.  Everyone is happy to welcome Formula 1 again, and it should be a good one. I think right now we are struggling a little bit more than at the beginning of the year, which I think we were top five, top six, honestly, before Mercedes fixed some of the problems. I think we were in the fight with them. And now we seem two or three steps backwards compared to Australia or Jeddah but yeah, there are some new parts again this weekend to fine tune the car for this circuit. We were very fast on the straight in Baku. The car seems to like the low, medium speed circuits. And Canada is one of those so hopefully we are competitive. I don't know honestly.  This is a very difficult topic to really have an answer. I think in our case we will just concentrate on the things that we have to do. We've been quite okay in the first races, so it seems that we can control it. We just stopped lowering the car at one point because then it’s undriveable. And yeah, only in Barcelona, I think we had a very extreme case, when we had a little bit of a problem setting up the car and we had a very difficult race in Barcelona with the bouncing. I think it was actually the double of what Mercedes experienced in Baku. That was my rate of bouncing in Barcelona but still okay, manageable. Yeah, more or less agree. I think as drivers we seem to wanted to ask some help from the FIA, because obviously from us, it's difficult sometimes to go to our teams and tell them to lose performance,  just because we have pain or whatever. So you know, if they can do it for us it’s better, easier. Nothing to add. I don’t know, maybe, yeah.  There is a possibility. Yeah, good, good. I had the same question in Australia I think,  and when there were some rumours that they could join, and I’m still thinking that they are very good organization, very professional, they have a lot of good guys there. And  Formula 1 is a different level for sure but, you know, they have the passion for motorsport, and it will be super good, I think, for the sport to have Andretti name on the grid. I don’t know how old you are. I’m 40. So we should both keep going.",Canada,friday,Alpine
Sergio Pérez,"I didn't say that but… I mean mainly was the lack of pace, that cost us the victory. We had too much degradation and I think we’ve got on top of it. We understand why that happened and I think with the pitstops it can happen you know.  The boys are pushing flat out and a little mistake can be huge. It's only two and a half seconds slower but it's quite penalising, you know, in a race time. But it’s part of the game, the boys are pushing extremely hard. They've been really good throughout the season so we just had a one-off, hopefully. Yeah, we are, we are confident. I think we can be strong here around this place. Obviously, it's a track that you have to be very good in low speed and Ferrari seem to be extremely strong in in that. Well, I think all the teams are chasing the balance or chasing the downforce and the way to find that is just to go as low as possible. But there certainly is a limit on how low you can go.  We all want to be lower than we currently are but we all have limits where we can go to and if you're hitting those limits, that is not healthy for the drivers, like few of the drivers commented last weekend. So I think it's a good intervene from FIA to try and calm it down. You should be concerned about it for them. I mean, I think it's too early to judge this regulations. I think they've brought good racing, you're able to follow closer. Certainly, yeah. I think the downside of it is the bouncing that we are experiencing. But I think it's only race number eight so we are just starting a new era so we have to give time to the new regulations to get on and I think should we be OK. Yeah, I think I'm definitely more comfortable with the car than I was last year. For example, it took me a bit longer to adapt to last year's car so this year, I can feel that already from FP1 I can start working on the car instead of working how to exploit the maximum out of the car. So that's a huge difference over the weekend so when I go into qualifying, I'm much more prepared and similarly when I go into the race, so I think, yeah, we’ve got a good platform. I'm confident with the car and I know what I have to do with the team to take the most out of it.",Canada,friday,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"I drove a two-seater. It was alright. I’ve never done something like that before, so it was good. The people in the back had fun, which I think is the most important thing, right? So they get a little bit of an impression of how a Formula 1 car behaves. Of course, it's a bit heavier and stuff. But I have to say it was still breaking really well. It just was a bit difficult to steer because when you had a tall passenger, of course you can't move your elbows around. So in some corners I had to driver with one hand, but yeah, overall, it was a good day. Yeah, I always enjoy coming here. First of all, it's a great city, the track as well is quite unique, in the layout and the way the corners are, with the chicanes and the way you have to take kerbs. So I'm excited, you know, to be back and hopefully we’ll have a good weekend. It's not about confidence, just we had good races, but it's still a very long season and a lot of things can happen. Clearly, you saw that in the last few races how big of a turnaround it was, but we still need to focus on one-lap performance. You know, we haven't really had a lot of pole positions. And I do think that there is a lot of margin there. On the other hand, our race pace always looks good, some races really good. But on some tracks it’s very hard to pass, so you make your life a lot easier if you start at the front. I guess in general, yeah, it will be a bit stiffer, a bit more difficult to hit the kerbs compared to the past. But everyone has to deal with that. But yeah, just looking forward to see how the car is going to kind of behave. I mean, we haven't been here in a long time. So I'm also just looking forward to how the track is going to be like, what state that is in, in terms of grip, bumps, and things like that. Yeah, you know, for me, regardless if it's going to help us or work against us, I think always these rule changes in the middle of the year, I don't think it's correct. Of course, I understand the safety part of it but I think if you talk to every engineer and in the paddock, if you raise your car, you will have less issues anyway. But of course, naturally think ourselves but also the team, you know, you're going to try to find the limit of what you can cope with, your body itself, for performance, but I don't think it's correct that now they have to intervene and start applying these kind of rules that if you can't deal with the porpoising that you have to go up on ride height, because it is very simple: just go up on ride height and you won't have these issues. So makes it a little bit complicated. I think it will also be very hard to police in a way. But we'll see. Any porpoising issues on the game? Sometimes, like when I'm on a holiday? Yeah, we do play, because it's fun, right? It's, let's say, a bit more easygoing. You don't need to go into technical stuff and you just have a bit of fun with friends as well. So yeah, it's good. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of sports out there where I think you damage your body in general. I mean, once you retire from your career, you won't be like you were when you were 20. That is simply how it is. I mean, football players have problems with their knees, all sorts of injuries, or when you're a motocross rider or a Moto GP rider, the amount of bones they have broken in their body. You can always judge, ‘yeah, is that safest thing to do? No, but we are willing to take risks’. That's our sport. That's what I love to do. For sure. The porpoising we have at the moment is not nice and I don't think it's correct, but some teams are able to handle these things a lot better than others. So it is possible to get rid of it. So I don't think we have to overdramatise what is happening at the moment. We have a lot of smart people in this sport who can get rid of these can get rid of these things and for sure, in general, I think all the cars are bouncing a bit too much. But yeah, I do see a possibility of already… Well, you can see clearly at the moment that there are a few teams who don't really have that issue as bad. But it's something we have to look into. It’s just how the car is designed, because of having to run it so low for downforce and having to run it so stiff. It just the whole design of the car. So if you want to get rid of that you need a whole change of philosophy as well with the car. Well, it's about being able to live with it. It's just how it's going to go. So you have to deal with it. Yeah, we'll find out. I mean, like I said before, I don't even care about if it's better for us, or worse, it’s just I don't think it’s correct, but we'll see. I think nobody really expected it to be like this. So that's probably overlooked, maybe. But we have a lot of smart people here who can find a solution to that, for sure. And hopefully, of course, very soon. Maybe not this year, but for next year, maybe there are some solutions to get rid of that.",Canada,friday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, I mean, I was always interesting seeing people's perspectives and opinions in different lights. Obviously in front of you it's one thing and another in the background, sometimes people say different things. But ultimately, I think safety is the most important thing. And I don't think… I think there's at least one driver in every team has spoken on it and I don’t think it’s going to change a huge amount but I think there is a lot of work to be done and it’s positive that the FIA are working towards improving it, because we have this car for the next few years. So it's not about coping with the bouncing for the next four years, it’s about completely getting rid of it and fixing it so that the future drivers, all of us, don't have back problems moving forwards. Yeah, I think I don't think really is going to change much in performance. It's just going to… Well, I might be wrong. Who knows? We'll see. Yeah, very special coming back to Montreal. It's great to see the people, the city, it's great to see the energy throughout the city as you're going through. I remember my first time here and my first Grand Prix win here. My first pole, in 2007, so it's always special when I come back here. And, you know, my dad called me, and we reminisce about these sorts of things. And yeah, so it's great to be back. I can't wait to drive this track because the track is awesome. I just hope our cars better this weekend. I just had this itch to play old games. I've just recently bought an old Nintendo 64. Actually, no, I didn't but it, I found it in my storage. And then I went and got Golden Eye. And then when I landed I went to get Mario Kart, but they didn't have the Nintendo 64. So I bought a Sega Megadrive, a Sega Genesis, sorry, and then they had the Senna game there. So I was like, ‘Oh, this is perfect’. So I've been spending the last couple of nights driving the Senna game, but I’m not that quick on it. No, no porpoising. I don't think so at that time. No, it was excruciatingly painful at the time, so I'm just grateful I was able to get out. But yeah, definitely not at the speed that you’re supposed to be. Well, Silverstone is still one of the best circuits, if not the best, in the sense of having all the medium- and high-speed corners, and the high-speed corners are always the most fun to drive. And with these cars that we have today, I mean, if you look at Barcelona we had bouncing in the high-speed corners, so it might not be spectacular, but I'm hoping by then we may have fixed it. But we will see. I think for all of us is going to be amazing. And we also can follow a little bit closer this year. So hopefully the race will be better. I don't look at my season too often, and assess, in a sense of judgement. I mean, I'm working as hard as I can, staying positive. We’ve come off the back of a difficult year. And I'd like to think I'm the best team-mate I've ever been, to George, but also to all the engineers, all the mechanics and everyone working at the factory, and trying to keep everyone's energy high. I am trying a lot of different experimental things on the car to help us get the data and move forwards. You'll see this today, for example, we’ve got something relatively extreme. If it doesn't work, it's definitely a lot slower, because it's got less downforce, but that's my role. I take that responsibility seriously. And whilst, yes, it's not been ideal on some weekends, it's often set us back because we lost a session or two but that's okay. Because eventually we'll get there and I’m proud to have been a part of that process. Yeah, thank you for that question. I mean, Naomi doesn't need me to speak for her. But I know what it's like to be on the receiving end of hate online and there's just no place for it. And so I felt compelled to say something. This has been a male dominated sport for a long, long time and there is so much work that we need to do to improve the representation and the opportunities for women in all levels within the teams and within the sport. I think it has progressed a lot like I can only reflect on my own team for example. When I go back to the factory there's a huge increase of women coming in, more so on the kind of marketing space, and in like HR, for example. But in terms of engineers, we've got need to encourage more young women out there young girls out there to get into STEM subjects, and creating the opportunity. That's part of my role, in the background, working with Stefano and the FIA to make sure we’re making a more inclusive environment for everyone. No, I arrived here, and we've been talking about this for a while, and you don't see a lot of difference when you're standing behind the camera or when you're walking down the paddock. It's not shifted anywhere near as much as I would have hoped for. But it is a conversation that people like yourself, I'm grateful for continuing that conversation. And having Naomi there, that representation, as I said, is so important. And I think she's doing an amazing job. So I just tried to encourage her to continue to do what she's doing because she stands for a lot. Yeah, I mean, putting the technical side of stuff aside, I think just to reiterate, we definitely cannot…. I cannot stress how important health is for us. I think we've got an amazing sport here, but safety has to be paramount, it has to be the most important thing. And it's interesting here, and I have not spoken to him or a specialist on discs, but I can definitely feel like I'm a little bit shorter this week. And my discs are definitely not in the best shape right now. And that's not good for longevity. And there are things that we can do to improve that for all the drivers here. We want to arrive and do our job and put on a great show and race the safest and there is no need for us to have long-term injuries. So yeah, I just think we just need to work closely with the FIA and not take it lightly, which I don't think they are and continue to pursue it. Well, yeah, because there's a lot more bruising in the body after the races nowadays. So it's just taking you most of the week, generally to recover, and you have to do a lot more to do it. And I don't think that generally has anything to do with age, I think that's just, generally, because the bruising can be quite severe. It's interesting to hear from other drivers, I have empathy for the other drivers that have experienced it in a bad way. When you're experiencing 10 Gs on a bump, up to 10 Gs, which I experienced in the last race. That's a heavy, heavy load on the lower part and the top part your neck as well. Not really much more to add to that. I agree. I think they looked a lot of stuff, but they didn't anticipate this coming. So we need to work together with all the teams, the FIA needs to work with all the teams to progress forwards. And when it's on safety grounds, it means that everyone needs to move. So in the last race and previous races, we have raised the car and you still have bouncing. Porpoising is more about the flow structure underneath the car. So we’ve run the car very high, most of the season. And it's not until Barcelona that we started to be able to get it a little bit lower. We had no bouncing for the first time in Barcelona, except for in the high-speed corners. And then it appeared again in Monaco and in Baku, so we had to raise the car again. But even when we raise the car, this thing still bounces. And we can't go any higher actually. We're limited by the rear suspension now. So we do lose performance naturally when you do go higher, but this porpoising is caused by the disrupted flow underneath the car. And so in terms of micro-concussions, I've definitely been having a lot more headaches in the past months, but I have not seen a specialist about it. So I'm not taking it too seriously or just taking painkillers. So hopefully I don’t have the concussions. Well, I meant I imagined we're going to get this fixed over by the end of next year, at least. So hopefully, that's not going to be something determined from racing longer, but time will tell.",Canada,friday,Mercedes
Alex Albon,"Yeah, it was a it wasn't a bad weekend for us, actually. We were struggling all weekend and we seem to be a bit better in the races than we are in in qualifying trim. So it's one of them things that we are obviously trying to focus more on a Saturday. But it shows that there is pace in the car. Obviously, we haven't had any major upgrades since the first race, so we are a little bit behind in that sense. But if we are still able to fight in the races, with what we have right now, then it's promising into the future. I wasn't very good on my first weekend, so maybe I'm not the one to ask. No, it's obviously very challenging. As Max said, there's a there's a big trade-off between how can you take the kerbs, but also, you know, downforce, more than ever with these cars. It's going to be very tricky. I'm sure we're going to be using less road, less kerbs than we were doing in 2019. But then there's also the long straights, so relatively low downforce here, which makes it lively through the corners. Yeah, same comments, I think. I don't think many people predicted what we were going to get into. I do think we can massively help situations as well. We got rid of a lot of inertia dampers and things like that. I don't know if they would have changed drastically, but I think nothing's like that most probably would at least help the situation.",Canada,friday,Williams
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I mean, definitely it felt like Baku was another step up from my side in terms of just adapting the speed straightaway, from the off, in P1. And yeah, obviously, the whole weekend, especially in the race craft, we were very strong, looking very good to finish definitely in the points and probably, you know, around just behind or in front of Sebastian would have been the position, if we get to finish but yeah, obviously four races, three DNFs is pretty frustrating on my side. Regarding, especially last weekend, I think I felt like I was able to pretty much give everything I had and to be up there together fighting with the midfield battle. But so yeah, in terms of progressing it’s very clear that I'm getting much better and better and more confident in the car. But in terms of results, it's still not time yet to show them on Sunday. I mean, I'm not too worried, just because the team has been pushing so hard from Sunday night to Wednesday to get the reliability issues solved or to be having a short turnaround, a short, quick upgrade in that, because it's very limited time. But in terms of package, I think we have a little bit better understanding before when we go to Silverstone, with more time, but yeah, obviously is a bit more of a question mark. But looking at the temperature, everything is a little bit cooler. These put us in a window where we are facing maybe, you know, less issues. But yeah, from my side, I just really want to get the race to finish because it seems like we've always had a good chance to be fighting for points finishes. Enough, I think. Obviously, is another new track but not the first time going to a new track. It’s a little bit similar to you know, Melbourne, looking at how the track grip is and looking at how the track is different. You have to ride quite a lot the kerbs, and with this year's car, like the others said, you know, it's not going to be the easiest ride. But on my side, I think the preparations didn’t really change much compared to other races. So I'm just quite, quite happy with how we approach each weekend. We just, you know, continue like this.",Canada,friday,Alfa Romeo
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, I mean, the simulator work went pretty well. And I think you know, it's one of those tracks where it is quite historical, so you have driven quite a few laps beforehand. And so yeah, just excited to get on it and do my first laps on this real track. Yeah, we'll have to see obviously. It seems the Baku straight-line speed was a bit of a critical issue for us, but hopefully that will be a bit of a better, let's say, trade-off for here and yeah, we'll be competitive. Yeah, I think it was more of a combination of porpoising and bouncing, like the touching. My back was quite sore afterwards as well, which is an issue I think we all face in some ways. So yeah, hopefully it will be a bit easy here but it looks quite bumpy out there. Yeah, there is I mean, I came here in 2011 with my dad and you know got to see the whole work behind the scenes but also got to spend some time behind the tents and fish. So, I caught quite a few fish actually and put them back in every time. It was good and just a lot of memories. I mean, that was in the Mercedes time, I think, if you guys still remember that.",Canada,friday,Haas
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah. Thank you. Very excited, especially because I've been here since Monday, so looking forward to getting the weekend started after so many days of waiting. And looking at the track, that looks as good as always, as fun as always, and I think it's going to be an interesting weekend with everything that this track offers and the way that you need to drive it, it’s always been one of my favourite ones and looks great. It was a difficult couple of days to try and analyse and explore what the issues were on my car. We've found the issue and we know what the problem is. On the other side of the garage, with the engine failure, it was a bit trickier to find it with only four or five days of analysis, and we're going to need to keep digging into it to find the solution. But as a team, we are still motivated, we are united. We are going through a bump in the road, which I think after the step that we've done in the engine this year, I would much rather take this step and take a bump in the road than have an unpowerful (sic) engine that is reliable. I think, as a team, we've done a great job with this year’s engine and we're just going through some issues that are going to be solved, I'm sure. Happy to be in the fight for pole during the qualifying and happy to be feeling a bit more at home and more than at home, understanding a bit what direction I need to go with the set-up and with my driving. I think it's been a bit of progress been done since Barcelona, during Monaco and Baku and we're now coming into Canada I expect to do hopefully another step or at least keep learning in the direction that I'm learning, because I think that, yeah, it's coming. The only difficult thing is to get two good results together or consecutive this year for some reason I've been lacking a lot of momentum, consistency, you know, in the championship and I've already fallen a lot behind in the championship because of the amount of zeros that I have. But it keeps me motivated to try and win every race that I could. We were team-mate. We didn’t fight each other. There was a group in front of us that were very slow. I think it’s no secret that the ride this year over the kerbs has been quite a bit trickier and more difficult to ride them properly. Here I remember in the past you tend to ride a lot the kerbs and sure these cars are going to just take up a bigger hit from it and as drivers we will maybe need to adapt either the racing line or the set-up, one of the two. But I think it will still be a fun truck and I still think everyone will adapt by Saturday, Sunday, and it will be a super-fun track. The FIA has definitely listened to the conversation that we had with them in the last few weeks and to the drivers’ complaints. To be honest, I didn't expect such an early response or such an early action. Because I think we really need to look into the detail of what are the actions we need to take to make these cars [better] in the future. Take the right actions to make them a bit more benign for the drivers. But let's see how these rules are. I think they're going to start affecting pretty much every team in the grid because everyone is just running as stuff and as low as they can. But I'm interested to see how it affects everyone really, see how it goes. Yeah, just hoping that if the rain comes it doesn't come like yesterday, because you're not going to see much running. Yeah, let it rain but not crazy rain, because if not, we're all going to stay in our garages. It was a bit of a weird, hydraulic failure that we hadn't seen in the car for many, many years. But a failure that the team believes it's pretty easy to solve and move on from it. It happened and it happened to me, which is, again, unfortunate, but I'm not worried. The team seem to be pretty calm and confident that it shouldn't happen again. Yeah, I think I think the good thing about this year is that every circuit that we go to, there is a possibility of winning, which is something I've never had before in my career. And again, we come into Canada and I think the car is going to be good enough to fight the two Red Bulls and try to fight for the win, which is a great feeling to have. And something that as a driver you want to have for as many years of your career as possible. The fact that it’s a Ferrari just makes it even better. The fact that there is every morning, more than 50 people, 100 people in the door of my hotel, waiting there to cheer me on and to wish me luck for that day, I sign a few autographs, take a few pictures, I think this is one of the beauties of being a Ferrari driver that I will never forget, and I will always take with me, because this is a great experience. About the year, yeah, it hasn't been an easy year for me, it's not a secret, but I've talked about it already so much that I think you know why, and why I've been through some struggles with this year’s car and why I'm not performing at the level that I wish I was and I'm not feeling as comfortable as last year when I was neck and neck with Charles, so it will come and I feel like I'm doing some progress and I think sooner or later it’s going to come. Yeah, a few extra physiotherapy sessions with Rupert my trainer, a few extra scans to try and see what's going on here behind, if there's anything to be monitoring or to take extra care on. But apart from that put some extra sessions, mobility sessions, because obviously this makes you tighter and makes you less flexible, you have less mobility and you try and put more of that to compensate. So yeah, you're having to do some compensations for this for these cars in your training and the way you manage your days and your training plan, which I find it actually a challenge as an athlete, but it's part of the process it’s just as we said many times, is it really necessary that we having to do these things with the technology that we have nowadays in the world and in motor sport in general to be having to go through this process but everyone is listening to us and I'm pretty sure everyone's going to take steps for the future.",Canada,friday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"We have. What day are we today? It was Tuesday. Tuesday we were on the golf course. Exactly that. We started that way. But it ended up really going quite downhill. Yeah. And I got quite limited on balls halfway through, so I had to steady up, you know, and play a bit differently. But no, that was just some fun, you know, with a couple of others as well. So we just did some games and had a lot of fun. But the main thing is just relaxing and making sure we're prepared for this weekend. Yeah, I mean, finishing the race is always a good start. So I think that's the first aim. I think for my first year in Formula 1, I think it was looking to be a relatively decent weekend here. I think things were going reasonably well. The pace in the car was quite strong as well. So I'm hoping just from the pace of the car and things we can take a little step forward from where we were in Baku. And again, we can have a good weekend but I've enjoyed this track. I've driven it virtually for many years and I've always enjoyed it and also 2019 I enjoyed a lot. So hopefully we can just add to it by having a good weekend and then I'll probably enjoy it even more. I mean, it is very different is a track to drive it's extremely different. How you set up the car I think is also slightly different but trying to find the correct balance of downforce, you know, with it being in such a bumpy track, slowish-speed corners and medium-speed corners, you want the grip, you want a good car beneath you, but there are also some long straights and to defend, to attack on people, you always want that to be one of your strengths. So I think that's what we've tried to look into and we’ve tried to improve since last weekend. And hopefully we can back it up as well. Carlos said it well. I think it's hard to know the exact difference between the tyres and just the car itself. I’d say the car changes and stiffnesses probably played a bigger factor in kerb riding and so on. But I'm hoping it's kind of similar to what it was, because I enjoyed the level of let's say, how much you were able to attack the kerbs and things like that. So I'm hoping it's the same amount this year, even with the different cars. I mean, of course, I hope so. Silverstone is always just a great weekend itself, Formula 1 cars around Silverstone are always spectacular. And I think racing this year has also been generally better, especially… Maybe not so much at, let's say, tracks purely with long straights, but tracks where you’ve got these longer corners, such as Silverstone, I think that's where you see the big differences compared to previous years. So I'm hoping that will stack up and prove to be better racing, more enjoyable, you know, to look ahead to Sunday and yeah, going to go from there. But I think the main factor of it just being my home race again and the British fans all of that was pretty incredible last year, even after COVID. I know it's sold out but hopefully with even more people there and I'm hoping with more supporters for myself and more fans coming to cheer me on, then it's going to be even better. So I look forward to seeing them all there. I mean, if you told me that at Bahrain, then I would be very surprised. I think since then, and especially I guess the couple races after Bahrain, I probably would have had a lot more confidence to say it was a possibility. And I still hope Bahrain was a little bit more of a one-off, you know, with a lack of preparation and the problems we had going into it. But nevertheless, I think it's not like we've been amazing, it’s not like we’ve scored a huge amount of points, we've had great weekend's and some slightly tougher ones, but in general, things have still been on slightly the upward trend. So as long as we continue that, I'd be very happy with it. And this weekend, same as it has been. We've not got anything too new on the car, we got some different things to try. But we're probably going to be in the race with these guys alongside me, maybe not this guy, but these three. And yeah, it's hard to ever know where you're going to be on a different track and a new weekend. So as long as you're in the race with them, I'll be happy. And of course, I'll be even happier if I'm ahead of them. I hope so. I'm just hoping it’s a similar weekend to Imola. And if it's the same as that then it'll be a great weekend. No, I mean, I completely understood and I still understood at the time. But I think it’s just being in the position, with all the adrenaline and things like that. Apart from, you know, maybe I mean, I think it'd be good. I see more cars as probably a good thing. Not too many more. But I think if it's 22 or 24, I think that's a decent amount. I think that's what it used to be a few years ago when I kind of grew up watching Formula 1. So I think that’s great. More opportunities, I guess, for people to get into Formula 1 too and if it's for someone like Colton, then it's fully deserved. I was his team-mate back in 2015 and we have a lot of great memories together and I know how good a driver he is. And I think he's showing that in IndyCar at the minute. So I think it’s different driving styles, I think he would have to adapt. He's not been known maybe to be a tyre lover. And I think that's something you would have to get used to when he comes and drives on Pirellis. But apart from that, you know, he's got a lot of talent. He's a lovely guy, hard worker as well. And I think he's very suited to be able to perform at the level you need to be in Formula 1. No, I'm fine. No, I just take headache tablets when I drive but that's it.",Canada,friday,McLaren
Yuki Tsunoda,"No. I was planning to do a little bit but um, yeah, decided not to golf. Yeah, I just did the kayaking and met up with friends in Canada. Of course I did the simulator, a lot. And I also had a bit of warm-up yesterday in the… kind I forgot the name, it’s kind of, I did with Checo, the kind of the track or the machine that you can resurface on ice, or ice skating. I really forget it. But yeah, I did those one. And yeah, I think I was I think I prepared enough to come into this racetrack. Yep. Yeah, I think it was really good. race week, last week. We could easily finish in P5 or P6 as a team. It’s a shame what happened in my garage. But yeah, I think we had a good race week. And we hopefully we can continue like that in Canada as well. I think I never driven here, but I think it’s still driveable, I guess, based on what I heard, similar. This mixed weather probably will… Might potentially cause it to be a little bit difficult to prepare myself as it being a new track. But I'm still looking forward to it, anything can happen in the race? So? Yeah, just enjoy it here. Yeah, I'm fine as well.",Canada,friday,AlphaTauri
Kevin Magnussen,"I hope so. I mean, Baku was good until it wasn't. I don't see why, you know, it would be too different here. So fingers crossed, that we can still fight for points. And, you know, hopefully score some points, actually. I don't know if that's the case, really. It was worse in the beginning of the year, then it's gone through some stages, we've been trying different things. And, you know, it is there. And it's not pleasant, but it's part of these new cars and we deal with it, you know, Baku is long streets, a very long time at top speed. So you feel those bumps more in your body. It's going to be bumpier here than it wasn't in Baku, little shorter streets, so I don't know how it's going to be on your body. But yeah, it's certainly something that you take into account all the time when you set up the car. Yeah, I mean, they've done what they had to do, I guess. It's hard to get all the teams to agree on anything. And, you know, that's why the FIA is there to step in and sort out the issue. And there's been a lot of drivers now saying that they've got physical issues and concerns. So, it's definitely the the right step. Yeah, it's one of the old school tracks where you feel it if you make a mistake, especially in the last chicane, of course, the famous wall that I hit in 2019. And it's just a rough track. It's fun to drive and it's challenging. There are no high-speed corners but there are a lot of braking zones and you're jumping over kerbs and yeah, it's fun. Same as everyone. Yeah, I mean, mixed weather's always interesting I think for a race weekend and it always makes it feel like there's some sort of extra opportunity, I guess. You know, for someone like me and my position in the field it's exciting and yeah, I'm hoping for some mixed conditions. No, I mean, you try to be involved as much as possible. At the end of the day, I feel like the engineers and the designers, they do their thing. And at the end of the day, there's only so much you can give as a driver in terms of input on the engineering side. You try and say what you want from the car, where you want the specific things you like from the balance and the performance of the car, and then the engineering team take that on board. But, I haven't been a part of the development of this car at all, and, you know, I fit into it quite well. We all want the same thing at the end of the day, more downforce and power, I guess. And this car has a decent amount of both. In terms of next year, I think it's just like a continuous thing. The team knows me quite well, they know what I like and what my weaknesses are, and you try and work around those, but fairly straightforward, I'd say otherwise. Okay, And then I'm fine too!",Canada,friday,Haas
Valtteri Bottas,"I think I'm as excited as everyone here. It's definitely a race that we've been missing. It goes pretty high on my list as a race as a whole. And I can really see the whole city is also pretty pumped up for the weekend and excited because we've been away for so long. Yeah, it's been it's been nice. So I always tend to come here earlier. And now obviously, because of the time difference reasons but the days went pretty quickly. Had lots of good coffee, bit of cycling. I actually visited one of our team partners in the US on Wednesday, I think, so yeah it’s been going quickly. We have like as a precaution changed lots of lots of things in the car because we saw it as not performing and behaving as it should. But mechanically we saw something was not quite right. So also changed the parts in the suspension and everything. So yeah, to some cross weight and some symmetry in the (unclear) left, right, these kind of things. That was a bit odd. And we saw big balance difference between the two cars, with same set-up. So I'm pretty sure it's going to be fine now. And hopefully that means that we can again fight for some good points. I wish I would have a clear answer. There are so many factors, you know, with the ride, with the kerbing, the type of corners here, but I see no reason why we shouldn't be able to be strong. Same, same. For sure, mixed conditions always make it even more interesting and more unpredictable. And if that is the case that we only have one dry session before the race for sure the set-up is not easy to get right. And also the wing levels, everything, you know, it's always a compromise between the wet and the dry. So let's see. I'm sure it's going to be an interesting, unpredictable and exciting weekend. Actually, when I when I joined the team, I think already for this year I managed to you know bring something from my experience, mechanically to the car, the way the car behaves mechanically. So that was nice. And then, yes, for the future for the next year, working really, really closely with the team on everything, you know, based on how this car behaves and works and what we drivers feel like can be better. And yeah, always at the factory, when I'm there, I try to go around and ask questions and give my feedback to the people who are specifically working on certain areas and that's something I really enjoy. I think it last week that I saw the the first model of next year's car, the windtunnel model, and all that stuff I really love to see and be involved with. So it's interesting and it's actually something quite new for me at this stage of the of the year to actually aim so much far ahead. As obviously I'm here for the long term so it's nice to be working long-term goals together. I'm better than fine. I've never felt better in my life. As I get older, I just feel better.",Canada,friday,Alfa Romeo
Max Verstappen,"The Safety Car didn't help. I think, overall, they were very quick in the race, so it would have been really tough for me to close that gap to the end, even on fresher tyres. But yeah, it was really exciting at the end. I mean, I was giving it everything I had. Of course, Carlos was doing the same. You know, following is tricky around here. I could see he was pushing, charging, pushing. But of course, naturally when you're under DRS it's a bit easier to charge. So yeah, the last few laps are a lot of fun. Yeah, luckily, this year, we seem pretty quick on the straight. So that helps a lot. Overall, I think that we're very strong in the race. So yes, it would have been tricky to catch up. But then of course, the Safety Car came out, so they had fresher tyres. So then I was like… Well, I think I would have preferred attacking instead of defending, but luckily it worked out. It was a tough race. I mean, I expected to have a little bit more pace. But we seemed to lack a little bit compared to Carlos. That's of course the only one I could compare to, with the Ferrari. And, yeah, it was a bit more difficult than I expected. But I think, you know, we did our strategy and I think for us it worked. Like that was the right one to do. And I think at that second stop, of course, I had the fresher tyres, I was closing in on Carlos, but I was not sure if I actually would fully close that gap to the end of the race. But then the Safety Car came out. And I was also not very happy with that, because then I knew, of course, that he had fresh tyres behind me. And already with a little bit more pace compared to me and it’s difficult to defend. But yeah, the last 15 or 16 laps we were flat out, pushing to the limit. And I knew, of course, that I couldn't make a mistake. But it was good racing, you know. It's always more enjoyable to be able to really push in a Formula 1 car instead of just saving your tyres. I mean, not a go in terms of overtaking, but it was super close all the time. He was constantly in my DRS. I think not once he dropped out of it, you know, so the pressure is always on. It was very low grip out there, of course, because of the rain yesterday. So I knew it was always going to be a bit of a tricky start. But I think we managed that well. Yeah, I think it didn't work anymore. It decided to stop. I have no clue when it stopped. But at one point GP told me that, yeah, it was not working anymore. I think the in-lap, after the line. I guess it must have been working before or maybe it already didn't work before, which probably they don't mind! As long as I can hear him, that's the most important. It’s still a very long way and I know the gap of course is quite big, but I also know that it can switch around very quickly. I mean, race three I was 46 behind, so we just need to stay calm, we need to focus, we need to improve, because today we're not the quickest. It swings a bit, like last weekend it looked good in the race, now it didn't look as good but we still managed to win and that I think is also a quality and we just have to work together with the whole team you know to try and just find little improvements in the car. I don't think it's always been that they have been quicker on Saturday and then slower on Sunday. I think Barcelona they were also quick on Sunday. And there were a few more races. So it just, you know, goes back and forth a bit. And yeah, we need to understand of course… it also rained yesterday. Maybe that didn't help for us today with the greener track. But that's all things we have to look into. Maybe track layout, kerbs, whatever, we'll have a look into that but at the moment it's difficult to really explain why they were a bit faster than us in the race. Well, of course, you always have to make sure that you know the place where he had DRS, you have a good exit the corner before – but it was all about just really pushing to the limit and not making a mistake in general. Because I knew what even in Sector One, if I would have made a tiny mistake, Carlos would gain a tenth on me, and that might have been enough to then get closer in the first DRS zone, and then in the second you know… So yeah, it was proper racing, proper pushing. And I mean, I had my moments, where I had a bit of oversteer, and then I looked in the mirror and so Carlos as having the same amount of moments. So, it was really on the edge, but that’s good to see. I mean, in general, experience, just racing and being in Formula 1. Yeah, and then the rest is all down to whatever car you have, right? I always enjoyed coming here to Montreal, but we never really had a competitive package around here because we were always a bit slow on the straight. But luckily this year we seem quite competitive on the straights so I knew that this might… It was the first opportunity to really fight for a win and that just makes it that extra little bit more special to come here. But also what I really enjoy, coming here to Montreal, is just the old school kerbs. We have a lot of tracks where we have very standard kerbs and here they are still very iconic and unique. And we really have to keep them because it's so much better to drive for us. So yeah, I hope we can drive here for quite a few more years. Well, without my dad, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. So what he did for me is, well, difficult to explain. You know, as soon as he stopped in F1, he basically dedicated the next 12 years to make sure… well, make sure… he would try everything and he did everything for me to be where I am right now. I mean the amount of hours we travelled through Europe together and not only that, but also the workload he did back at home in Holland, working on my engines, preparing my go karts, being on the dyno, it was really crazy. Like when I would wake up and go to school, he would bring me to school and then he would go to the workshop and continue his work. After I finished school, I would go there and he was still working and he would be on the dyno. I would help him, he would show me what he was doing because he wanted me to understand, you know, what was actually driving me. And, yeah, it's been really… especially now when I look back at it, it's crazy and really… I'm really thankful for those times.  At the time I thought a bit lightly about it because I was like ‘why do I need to do all this? Why do I need to be involved?’ But it definitely helped me a lot, also later in my career and even now like… of course, he doesn't tell me anymore ‘you have to turn in here and you have to do this and do that’ but I just really like to share every single weekend, not only about racing but in general, just, you know, what I'm doing and stuff like that. I think it's very important to have that kind of relationship. So yeah, I hope he enjoyed today. I'm sure he was very nervous out there. He's always nervous. So yeah, at least we made it stick. So that was a good present, I think.",Canada,post-race,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I was pushing flat out. I wasn't leaving any inch to the walls under braking. I was pushing everything with the battery. I tried everything to pass Max, but today we just didn't have enough pace delta, you know, to get him close enough in the hairpin to then get him a bit out of line into the chicane. But yeah, the positive thing is that we were quicker, we were faster all race, it’s just that little bit more to overtake around here. Yeah, I'm particularly happy with the race pace with the way we managed to put pressure on Max during the whole race and you know, the timing of the pit stops I think was right. Honestly, we tried everything and we were very, very close to winning today. So I will take the positives and yeah, keep trying in the next one. Yeah, it was a tough, intense battle with Max. I knew I had a bit of pace delta on him from the whole race and I think it was five, six laps fresher [on] tyres, but I think to overtake around here you need to be more than those two or three tenths, you know. I gave it all. I was risking everything, you know, over the kerbs, close to the wall and having a few moments out there in the dirty air. I got close a couple of times but not enough to really throw a move down the inside anywhere. But I can tell you I was pushing. We… I was thinking about it now. The Safety Car stayed out for a bit longer than maybe what I thought or what the team thought. By time it was green flag, there was only 16 or something laps left, which was the right number of laps to maybe try and put on a Soft, and try to overtake Max on the warm-up phase of the hard. Now, it's easy to say. At the time, with still 20-something laps to go, the hard was definitely the fastest option to the to the flag, especially knowing that it was a bit of a fresher Hard to Max. It's a shame. I felt like also without the Safety Car, as Max said, he wouldn't have caught me easy. I think it would have been a good battle at the end. With him catching up on me, I was ready to hang it out there until the chequered flag. I was in good pace, I was still doing 17.3s. And I think we could have made it to a flag. I mean, without the DRS it’s impossible, because the DRS is still affecting you quite a lot, especially at this track that you cannot do different lines. It's all chicanes that you have nowhere to put your front wing to avoid the understeer and the overheating of the tyres. But, even like that, I was happy and confident to be in the dirty air and managed to stay even in overheating, 16 laps in DRS. I could close, I think in lap three, as soon as the DRS opened, and it was all about cooling the tyres, and regaining the battery to try and really drain it when catching him. As I said, I left everything out there. But compared to a Red Bull today, we were quicker, I think the whole race. First time the season that I think I can say that I was fastest man on track, which gives me some confidence and hope for the next races. But two or three tenths is not enough to pass a Red Bull, you need more like five, six tenths of pace delta if you really want to have any chance of passing Max. Yeah, I agree with Max. There is a bit of a trend. But I think recent races, it's been very difficult to compare race pace. I would say that coming from Friday, Max looked very quick on the long run. If anything, I felt like we were a tenth behind – but I think that switched today and we were a bit quicker – which is good news for us. And, as I said before, it gives us good data. And on the personal side, good feeling also that I was pushing out there really on the limit and with no mistakes and being able to push this car to be fast. Well, I hope so, but as I said a few races ago, I want to take it a bit more race by race, you know, not thinking too much about the championship or anything like that. I really want to focus in getting to a track and see if I can get myself in a good window of performance and comfort inside the car. I think this weekend I did that, right since FP1 I looked very quick, both in qualifying and race pace. In the race there (I) was pushing flat out without any fear of losing the car, like I had, for example, in Barcelona.  And also some good progress being made… we’ve changed a bit of things on the car to try and make them… make it a bit more to my liking, and they seem to be working. But at the same time, I think I need more circuits, I need more different kinds of corners to have a proper feel for that. Yeah, I have a very similar story to Max. My father retired from rallying in 2004 and in 2006 I started competing in go karts and since then he's been my right hand, my mentor, my advisor, my leader, you know, in terms of where… what I should do in my career, and it's great to be able to spend so much time of my childhood, you know, with my father and still having the same conversations that we used to have back in the day when I was 11/12 years old. He still tells me similar things and I'm very proud, you know, not only to share the racing side, but also I am proud to share a lot of moments with him in my family.  We play a lot of golf together, paddle, squash, he's 60 and getting old, but at the same time, we can play all these sports together which is great. And we are having a lot of fun. And he still comes to races and we enjoy them together.",Canada,post-race,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"How are you going Montreal? We've had such an awesome crowd here this weekend. It's quite overwhelming, honestly, to get this third place. It's been such a battle this year with the car and as a team. But we continue to stay vigilant and focused and never giving up. And that's something I'm so proud of and inspired by my crew. So thank you to everyone that's here and back at the factory. They're a little bit too quick for us at the moment but I was giving everything. But we're getting closer, so we've just got to keep pushing, keep pushing and eventually we hopefully will be in a fight with these guys. I could just about see them in the end. Thanks to the Safety Car but honestly our pace was quite good particularly in the second phase of the stint, and we did a lot of work back in the simulator but also here to get the set-up right, so honestly I'm ecstatic. I think, as I said, I didn't expect this coming into the weekend. It's my second podium of the year. So this feels really special, especially here where I got my first Grand Prix win. I love it here in Montreal. So, a big thank you to all the Canadians. It's good. I'm back to being young! It feels great today, to be in amongst the battle. And for a second, at the end there, I was just about keeping up with these guys – but then they pulled away at the end. But it’s given me and the team a lot of hope. I think that there's more to come from this car. The potential is truly there if we can get the set-up, right. And I think that's been the most difficult thing this year, is really trying to optimise the set-up. The window for this car is much, much smaller than any other car we've experienced. And yeah, I’ve not been on the podium for a long time. So, especially as I had my first one here 15 years ago, to be back up there and get to experience the energy from the crowd was very reminiscent of that first year here and yeah, I'm so, so happy with it. I wasn't really lost. It's just we tried two different avenues and the avenue I was down was dreadful. So, we collated all the data we had and we made drastic changes to the set-up. And it was much, much, much nicer today. More in line with what we anticipated and it was good. When you get a full race distance in, you find a lot of things out about the car and the relationship you have with the car and data, etc. So, there's a lot to take from today. One really great thing is we've got really good reliability, which I think is a real tribute to all the great work all the team are doing at both factories. So, we just got to keep our heads down, keep working and hopefully I know where I'm losing to these guys, so that's where I'm going to go and try and focus on attacking, to improve. I think we're better in medium and high-speed corners probably, than we are in the low-speed corners so I… but we have bouncing, so I don't know how it's going to be through Copse and all those places. Max doesn't know what I'm talking about – but Carlos knows what I'm saying. So, it'll be interesting for us there. But yeah, really excited to get back to the UK, the weather's incredible right now, so I hope it's the same next week. The balance I had on Monday (sic ‘Friday’) was neutral, super positive, so no rear end. And as soon as you apply one degree of turning, the rear end’s come around. So, I was just fighting that constantly and it was very difficult to keep it out the wall. That's why I didn't finish my long run, because it was just undriveable in the set-up window that we tried. It was just an experiment, to see whether the car would work there, it didn't. So, then we made the changes, and today was a much more… a much, much better balance in terms of I had a little, nice amount of understeer today, better traction, not having those snaps. So, it was  night and day difference. We still have bouncing, that's not going away. Yeah, much better than Baku this weekend, with the suspension that we chose. Yeah, maybe in the second half of the season George can do the experiments! We're just trying to work… we're just trying to progress as a team. And yeah, I think moving forward, I think we'll be a little bit more cautious on doing too many experiments as it really does hinder you through the weekend, especially if you only have practice one and two in the dry and don't get a FP3, for example. So yeah, I think there's lots of learnings from this weekend, and improvements that we can make moving forwards. But you know, really great pace today. And it's so nice to see, it’s not always been the case I've had with this car so it's nice to have a bit of a good battle with her today, her or him, whatever you call a car. And I really hope, moving to Silverstone… it’s such an important race for us and for me and so I really hope that… I just want to be in a battle with these guys.  At the end there when the Safety Car came in and we started again, I was hoping that I could just… the dream was like if I can keep in that battle with them and find a way but they were rapid. But we will get there eventually. Yeah, well, the bouncing was nowhere near as bad as the last race. The last race was… there was no words for how hard it was. But this weekend, we managed to… we did have bouncing but it was nowhere near on the… if the last race was 10G's this one maybe was to two or three or something like that, you know, so it's livable. But we still, I think, as a sport need to do better and I think us as a team also need to do better. Yeah, similar to these guys. Contrasting difference, you know, my dad would have given everything to be a racing driver when he was in his younger days. But coming from the humble beginnings and just with the dream of creating a better opportunity for his kids than he had and I'm forever grateful for my Dad, you know, the journey that we've been on, the struggles that we had, and to be in here and our first Grand Prix win in 2007, looking down at him, knowing everything he did, to raise money and to…  literally almost selling the shirt off his back to keep us racing. I hope that he's proud today. And I continue to try to do him and my whole family proud with every moment that I step in that car. And yeah, Happy Father's Day to all the fathers out there because it's such an important role. And I've got friends that didn't have their father with them and the mothers have done such an amazing job. But it's great to also be able to celebrate the Dads today.",Canada,post-race,Mercedes
George Russell,"Yeah, as we said before, you got to be there at the end to pick up the pieces. And thanks so much to all the guys back at Brackley and Brixworth for doing a great job. To get the car to the end is not easy this year with everything that's going on. The cars are going through a torrid time with the bouncing. And yeah, pleased to bring it home in P3. Not third, to be honest. I think P5 was the maximum we could have achieved on merit, and on pace, let's say – but obviously this is a team effort, and you've got to be there at the end to pick up the pieces, score the points. And for us to show for all the hard work back at Brackley and Brixworth to deliver a reliable car and reliable power unit, and capitalise from others’ misfortunes, whatever you want to call it. I think the car has been feeling OK to drive, to be honest. The balance is good. Just the challenge is just the bottoming, to be honest, I think it doesn’t matter what boat you're in either, you’ve got the porpoising and you're hitting the ground. And if you don't have porpoising, you're running the car millimetres to the ground, and you're bottoming out. And I think, yeah, feeling it on the back at the moment. But nevertheless, as I said, we've got to keep on working hard to find more performance and understand what we need to do to unlock that. And yeah, I don't think we'll have any major updates or anything to try in Canada, but maybe for Silverstone, we'll have a better idea. Kind of like what Max said, you've got to keep on scoring. You know, this is a Championship where you've got the chance to score every single race and it doesn't matter how fast your car is, if you're not scoring those points, then your tally is not going to increase. So, as I said here, great work from everybody back at the factories to deliver a reliable car – but we can't keep on relying on others' misfortune, and we need to find more performance. And that's what everyone's trying their hardest to achieve. I think we've got to stay open-minded about everything and go about things logically, analytically, and I think nothing's off the table at this stage. And ultimately, we're just trying to deliver a car that is the fastest over a lap. I mean, the porpoising has not been that bad this weekend. We've barely had any issues, it’s just the ride and running very close to the ground to get as much performance as possible. But as I said, at the moment, we're struggling to unlock that. So, as I said, open-minded and nothing's off the table. Yeah, I think that was totally understandable because every single team is understanding and developing their cars around a set of regulations and any change, nobody knows what is going to be the consequences. And even us, I think we voted against it. And even now, we want change but who knows what that change is, it's just us, 20 drivers, we would choose to have a safer ride out there and when you’re going 300kmh between the walls and you barely can keep the car in a straight line. I couldn’t even see my pit board, the car was moving around so much. We have the technology in Formula 1 to resolve this with a click of our fingers, I believe, so as I said, nobody's looking to take advantage from this, we're just looking for a safer, easier solution.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"I mean, you can never make up what you lost last year. But I think today we had an incredible pace in the car, we could really look after the tyres and we could chip away at it, pass for the lead. But then, of course, also maybe a tiny bit lucky with the retirement, but I think nevertheless our car was really good today, so I could have closed that gap. Then of course you have a race on your hands. But overall, yeah, really happy with how the balance of the car was today? I don't know, just tyre behaviour, together with just general grip of course of the car. And you know that's what you need around here, that you can look after your tyres. So at the end, you know to have a one-two as a team as well, it was a really, really good day for us. I don't know. I think every weekend is a bit different and you really have to be precise and you really have to be on it with little things for the race management as well. So it can swing around every single race with every single race we do. Yeah, I think overall it was a very good race. I had a good start, but I couldn't really go anywhere, of course, as it’s a short run to Turn 1. But after that it was all about just trying to stay there, try to, of course, get a bit of a move on, but it was very hard to pass. So we just waited. Then, of course, the VSC came out. We opted to stay out with both cars and tried to go a bit longer and yeah, it felt good. I had good tyre deg on the mediums, I could get into the lead. And once I put the hard tyre on, I think it would have been a really interesting fight to the end with Charles to see how much we would have caught him, because I think we did have a bit of a pace advantage. Of course unfortunately we never got there to have a fight but yeah, overall it was a good day, strong day and good pace in the car and we could really look after our tyres. Yeah, absolutely. Well, hopefully many more to come. Yeah, we also do more races a year, right? So if you have a good car… It's not really comparable, but it's nice for the books. Yeah, well, I mean, of course, we had our misfortune in the beginning of the year, so we knew that we had to play a bit of catch-up, but then of course it seems like now it's more or less evened out with the bad luck and you have to score points every single weekend if you want to really fight for the championship. Everyone knows that, everyone of course tries that, but it's not always that easy. I think every single weekend is a bit different. But yeah, we know, I think, with the car performance on Saturday we are not as quick as Ferrari for whatever reason. Maybe it helps us on a race day, who knows? But I also want a bit more performance, just for myself on a Saturday, just with the feeling of the car as well. But on a Sunday, in general, it always feels a bit better. But yeah, there is still, of course, enough work to do to try and improve the car. But I guess everyone has the same thing. But again, it was a very good day for us today. It's still a very young and new car so we will always look to improve. And at the moment, it looks like Saturdays is the biggest room for improvement. Well, it's always difficult to know before you get here how competitive you're going to be. We, of course, know that the fights so far have always been between us and Ferrari but to exactly know where you would be, difficult to say, but I think, yeah, even after yesterday, it was a bit of like, okay, we were behind in qualifying but where are we going to be in the race? So yeah, I never really think about it too much;  just see, you know, once you get into the race.  Of course, we all have our information but even on a race day a lot of things  can change and luckily it was good for us this weekend. Yeah, the track is good. It is enjoyable to drive, just, I think, it's getting a bit bumpy in some places, especially now with the new cars being so stiff and low to the ground. I think the main straight is way too bumpy, we have to really try and find a bit of a line. So it would be nice if that could be resurfaced for next year. But overall, I think it's a special track, also the second sector, you know, between the castle bit, it's quite unique, I would say. I don't know. I didn't look into the car. Well, as soon as we got out and they told me the gap, I think it was like 12/13 seconds,  that's quite a bit of a gap to close. But then I saw his pace as like, I think, yeah. I was like, yeah, let's see if we can fully close that gap. I had confidence that with the car we had today and the pace we had that it would have been an interesting fight to the end. I would always say shit happens. Yeah, that's racing. You know, it happened to me, it  happened to many people in the past. Unfortunately, it's happening to Charles. Yeah. If I will be in the same situation I would also be disappointed. I think that's very normal. But yeah, it's about how you come out of it. You always look at how to improve things. That's what we did as well in the beginning of the season. You learn from it, you don't like it, you're angry, but we turned it around, but you always have to stay on it because something else might happen and you always have to prevent these issues from happening.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, unfortunately, we missed the Virtual Safety Car stop. There was some miscommunication and once we wanted it, it was a bit too late. And we were a bit unlucky there because that would have made up our race when we were leading. And then at the restart I just got too much deg, I think, on that medium tyre. The deg was extremely high for me. And it's something that we have to understand what happened there. Because certainly Max was a lot stronger today on that medium. So yeah, a lot of things that we have to review from today, but it's still a very good team result. I think it was the right call made by the team, because at that time Max was a bit further ahead and it was just a good team result and you know, in this place, anything can happen. So at the end of the day, we managed to do a one-two so that's a great team result. Yeah, it was a great start, to get Charles of the line, and really be able to do your own race. It was looking great all the way up to the Virtual Safety Car. Then there was a bit of miscommunication with the team under the Virtual Safety Car. So we missed the opportunity to pit under the VSC, which was quite costly. And then we hit a lot of deg on that medium tyre after the Virtual Safety Car. So a few things to understand from that today. Certainly Max was quite a lot stronger in that phase of the race. And then it was mainly about bringing home after the Ferrari issue, so yeah, a few things to understand today because I don't think also the stops were not ideal. So yeah a few bits to understand today to try to improve them for Montreal and improve our race pace because certainly Max deserved the win today. Well, it's the team who decides and at the time I didn't have the information whether we wanted to pit or not. I only got the information too late, once it was too late to pit. Yeah, I'm not the one deciding when to pit, and yeah, unfortunately we have certain communications in place that we know when to pit and when the window’s open – but a few things went wrong today. I need to understand that, to be honest. Right now, it didn't feel that I was hitting the tyre too hard at the time. It was certainly right at the restart after the Virtual Safety Car that we lost the pace, I think all the way to that stage, things were looking right; things were looking okay. But it was mainly after the virtual safety car when we really dropped the pace massively. Yeah. I'm sure it's something related to it. Probably we lost a bit of temperature on those tyres, at that time, together with some wear. So, we just have to understand what happened. And with Max, he was clearly a lot faster at that stage of the race. So yeah, it was the right call not to fight because I didn't have any pace at the time and Max deserved to be ahead at that point. We also boxed too late. So, there were a few things that played into the result today, but still at the end of the day, Max deserved the win, because he was the faster car.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think the start of the lap was good. Then it went away from me a little bit, tiny mistakes. So, yeah, not ideal, but in general just struggling a bit to find front-to-rear balance over one lap. So yeah, not of course what I want, but still I think, as a team, being second and third we have a good opportunity for tomorrow. I guess we'll find out tomorrow. But I think overall we seem to lack maybe a tiny bit over one lap. But clearly, I think in the long run normally our car should be quite good. To be honest, just consistently a bit off. So, just a bit tricky to find, again, a good balance front-to-rear throughout the weekend, qualifying… and yeah, basically that just continued every session the same until the flag. I'm not sure it's nine, but maybe we are a little bit faster. But a lot of things can happen. I mean, you also need to be quick in the corners, of course, it's not only the straights, so we'll find out tomorrow. The plan is, of course, as a team, to optimise the results. So that's what we'll try to do. The run to Turn 1 is super-short, so there's not a lot you can do there. But yeah, like they said, it’s a long race, Baku has shown that a lot of things happen. And yeah, we just need to stay calm and focus on having a good race car. No. I mean, we have a given… You know, one weekend Checo is ahead out of the box, then I'm ahead. So I was just like: ‘what happened there?’ So I asked and they said there was a little issue which they had to resolve. That's why it took a bit longer for Checo to come out of the box. I think last year I started third here. So yeah, a lot of things happen. If you have good pace, I do think you can do something out there in the race. So yeah, we'll just, you know, look through the data to optimise everything for tomorrow. And yeah, just make sure that the car is good on the tyres.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah. When you get to Q3 run one is when you go balls out. And it was a little bit too much. I hit the wall a couple of times. Luckily, we managed to survive, which is the key really here. But it was not an ideal qualifying, because at the end we just had a problem with the engine. We couldn't turn it on. And that meant I was basically on my own and that's very powerful around here. Who knows if it was enough for pole but certainly we lost a few tenths but I think Charles had a very good lap. Yeah, I think tomorrow it's a very long race ahead. So we just have to make sure we are there. It's a very long race, you know. At any point you can make a mistake. And that's it. No, I think when you look back at it, it looks quite big. You know, to gain three tenths is probably too much. Probably realistically I don't think pole was achievable today, but certainly we could have been a quite a bit closer, you know, but I was on my own and that seemed to be quite costly around here, especially on the back straight. Not having a tow from the cars ahead, I could just see my delta, losing lap time through it. Basically through all the straights I was losing quite a bit of time. But I mean, P2, I think we can still race from here. I think we should be strong tomorrow in the race. And hopefully we can keep Charles under pressure. I hit it  quite hard a few times, but it seems to be very strong, the car this year. Yeah, on my first lap I just pushed too hard in qualifying. I mean, I was lucky not to crash because I was just over the limit a bit too much. Just trying too much. And yeah, it wasn't ideal, but then we managed to put it all together in the final lap. Well, I just know that here is a long race, you know, and we have to be there. We are in a good position and anything can happen tomorrow. I don't know yet. I need to speak back to the guys. Just the car wouldn't turn on. So I think there was a miscommunication. But yeah, we just lost too many seconds and got all in a bit of a rush, because it was tough getting there to make the lap.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"It feels good. This one, it's… Obviously all pole positions feel good but this one I probably did not expect it, because I thought Red Bull was strong. Especially in Q1 and Q2, I really struggled to see that we were faster. But then in the last lap, everything came together. And again, I managed to do a good job so I'm extremely happy. I'm really excited for tomorrow. I think we'll have quite a bit of answers tomorrow because tyre management is a big thing here. In Barcelona and Monaco we were managing it well, even though in Monaco it was difficult to see anything. But overall, our race pace has done a step up since we brought the upgrade. So tomorrow will be very interesting whether it will be the case here too. Sorry? Yeah, thanks very much. I don't know. I mean, Monaco was pretty satisfying, too. But yeah, on street tracks, it always felt very, very special to push the limits, with the walls. And yeah, you can feel you're on the limit and you know that whatever mistake you are doing at that time is just a wall. So the adrenaline is running high and it's great to be on pole . It didn't feel like I left much on the table. Turn 2 I was losing all the time and on my final lap I just released the brakes and prayed that it was okay. I think it was a pretty close one there. And then the last corner was a bit trickier but I think it was more wind related. So overall, I was very happy with the lap. It looked strong in FP2. Whether it's strong enough compared to the Red Bull, this we will see tomorrow. I think since we have the new package we've tried different things. And from my feeling it feels better in the race. But we still need to confirm it tomorrow. So tomorrow we will have the answer for that. But the feeling is there and it’s good. So I'm optimistic for tomorrow. I just want to finish the job. The past two weekends I've already said that on the Saturday and it didn't happen on the Sunday. So we need to make it… I mean, we don't need to make it work but it will be very nice if we'll make it work tomorrow. Let's see how it goes in the first few laps, and then I will try to keep the lead. Yeah, it was the first time that we were trying this package and I think it was quite positive. In the middle sector we were still quite competitive. Then to do a comparison between FP1 and FP2 is very difficult because there's a lot of driver evolution, track evolution, so the track is very different. But overall, we are pretty happy with that new package and it's working as expected. So it's positive.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, I think it will be different, but there won't be any surprises compared to some other tracks I race, for example, in Bahrain, as tracks, Jeddah, for example. Of course, the speed will be massive difference. And also, you have to adapt a little bit the braking point also, because I think you are braking super-late and it's very easy to make an error – as we saw last year in qualifying. So, it will be different but after experiencing Monaco, I think that just gives me… gained this experience and into these different tracks. I think this track probably more similar to Jeddah in terms of how you have to approach the circuit. I feel like there's nothing special really, but FP1, I think, will be a session just to be adapting again and getting into the rhythm. I probably wouldn't say too much here because I think expectation was very high in Monaco, obviously, I think, surprised us as well, as a team, that we didn't really perform as much as we wanted with quite of lot of low speed in Monaco layout. This weekend, of course, the layout is a little bit differently: it’s more like hard braking. I think in terms of the layout, it shouldn't be a big effect. And we have to say we already find the issues we were facing in Monaco that probably hold us a little bit back in terms of qualifying performance. We felt like this weekend we can do a better job than last time, and we have to just see, compared to the others, because here, anything could happen. In qualifying, with a massive slipstream, for example, like that. I think we have a good package and a good weekend. I have to say, probably not too much, just because obviously, especially, this year’s tyres. In Formula 2, firstly, in the long distance, you have to manage it quite a lot of tyre, they’re pretty much dead after three or four laps, where here you can push a little bit more through. Sometimes in qualifying, like we saw in Monaco, or a track like Jeddah. In general, the downforce difference is a big jump. So, the way you have to approach the corner, and the way you have to prepare yourself, the radius of the corners is completely different, and so, yeah, it takes a bit of time to adapt. Especially in Barcelona, in Bahrain in T-01, T-02 [First pre-season test, second pre-season test]. It takes time to be knowing how to drive these cars fast, faster. And yeah, it's a bit of change but still, the normal driving procedures doesn't really change much. Just to adapting different cars. Of course, you have a power steering wheel that just changes a massive feeling of the tyres. So, that's probably one of the main tasks.",Azerbaijan,friday,Alfa Romeo
Kevin Magnussen,"I think it's an interesting race always. It's usually quite eventful, with lots of Safety Car chances. In the past, there's been loads of stuff happening. It feels like one of those races where you can hope for some special result. So of course, that's what we do this weekend too. We are hoping that we can race well and then hope for some kind of surprise. Yeah, I think so. We've had good pace, at basically every race –  maybe Melbourne is the only one that stands out, where we were behind on pace, in terms of being in the mix in the midfield – so I think with, as you said, momentum, we need to kind of just get in there, get the ball rolling and start scoring points regularly, because I think our car has the pace. A little bit, I guess. It's a street circuit and you kind of approach the street circuits a little different. But it's a cool track. I think it's different, it's challenging. There's some pretty unique parts where the track narrows, and then you're using kerbs. It's quite a cool track, I think: although it's a lot of straights it's still a big challenge. I don't know. I think it's different. But getting used to it, I think. I’d agree with Max, that the cars have more understeer mid-corner; that the car doesn't want to rotate as well as the old cars. I haven't struggled with it. It's very stiff and bumpy, of course – that's the main thing that you notice when you drive these cars for the first time. You think, okay, this is different. It's very harsh on every bump and every kerb. But, you know, it's still a Formula 1 car, still good to drive, it's still super-fast. I've been driving prototypes all of last year and coming back to this, probably I feel the difference less, because I came back into a Formula 1 car that is a lot faster than what I just got used to, in sports cars last year. So, it's fun.",Azerbaijan,friday,Haas
Lando Norris,"I would say so. Just off how we've been doing lately, this year. Barcelona was a decent race, could have been a little bit better and Monaco was a strong weekend for us. So, I'm hoping so. We always hope for… In Baku, like Kevin said, many things can happen here. There's always unexpected people on the podium and stuff like that. So, as long as we're in that position, and at the end of the race, to kind-of potentially be in that position, that’s the aim. Good straight-line speed is always a lovely thing. I think you need a car which gives you good confidence, as always, especially with the braking. Braking, there's always good time to find. So, that street circuit vibe, there's less room for error than on normal circuits. So, being able to position the car where you want, being able to brake how you want, you need that confidence in the car to be able to find the limits and to gradually find that… know the walls and things like that, use all the track space. So just a good car with good confidence. Straight-line speed is the actual bonus. I would say so. I think Monaco is always a real test of having that confidence. With bumpy braking, especially in this year's car, I would say Monaco was probably a trickier race and trickier lap to deal with that it wasn't in previous years. Maybe a little bit slower but the same time I thought trickier with the braking, with more bumps. So, I think that was maybe more of a test for the car and actually, what we got, and the confidence that it gives me, I was happy with that. So, I want to say that I'm happy coming here. But it's also much lower downforce and things like that. So, it's a new test for us. It changes. So most weekends… I think there's been weekends when Alfa Romeo been a long way ahead of us. I think realistically they've been probably a quicker car throughout the whole season. Haas have at times been quicker than us. I think we've just been consistently good, especially since Bahrain – maybe not in Bahrain – but since then, we've just had a package which performs decently at every track, which is always a good thing: to be there every time and to be in the points. I think we were probably ahead of Mercedes in Monaco. So around third, fourth, fifth, maybe sixth area. I think it's a close group. So, as long as we're towards the front of that, I'll be happy. I think Max explained it well, really. Mainly because I've not had to think about it probably as much as him. So, I think what he said is correct, and especially with the investment part into young drivers. It's difficult enough to get into Formula 1 at all, so as soon as you have the backing, where you have an investor, as a driver. They obviously want their money back at some point and you're going to have to do that. If it gets capped, and so on, it's much harder, and will interest people much less to ever invest into young drivers and invest into people having chances to get to Formula 1 in the first place. So, I think that's probably one of the main points. But Max has probably has thought about it much better than me – and therefore his answers is better. I think there are still some slightly tougher areas maybe. I want to believe in general we've probably improve the car like on average through all the tracks. I think there's still a few which we were yet to go to which we struggled at a lot last season. And I think it's different in terms of characteristics to a lot of the ones we've been to – so places like Zandvoort and things like that. So, we’re still yet to explore all of the ranges of types of corners and tracks and so on. But I want to believe, and I think have some confidence in saying, that we've improved the car throughout most of these areas. And what we need now is, in general, just a whole package upgrade. I think it’s handling reasonably well: there's definitely types of characteristics that, personally as a driver, I still want more from the car and it's just hard to go in that direction. It changes: every driver wants something different. I think from what Daniel and I want from the car is quite similar but there's definitely differences in some driving styles and stuff and I sometimes bias my car more one way than what he does, kind of thing. So it changes – but it's also down to personally how I feel I want to drive the car. And I believe there's good lap time in going in that direction. But it's just a hard thing to improve on, especially from one race to the next. But I think over the next races and next months and hopefully when we can bring some more bits to the car, then we can move in that direction.",Azerbaijan,friday,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"As Lando said, it's difficult to tell, it's a close group. Definitely, when we qualify in the top 10, and, we have the pace in qualifying, but it changes all the time, it's very, very close. And, Well, that's the aim. It's always the aim, to get closer to the top. But we still have a long way to be able to do that. So, to get to the top of that close group is already what we should aim for. Get closer to Ferrari, Red Bull, it's another task. We will push hard; we will try and fight and try to be on the right side of the opportunities this time. Yeah, he's right. Yeah, you need definitely good confidence, on the brakes especially. We've seen a lot of mistakes in on the brakes in Monaco, in here last year. To attack all the corner entries after such long straights is what you need to get. So, that will take time. We have three practice session together right before Quali, so the time to push is Quali. As Max said, I was asking Lando actually, I don't know who it is exactly. But no, I mean if he's proven that he can, that he's capable. I don't think age should be a limit. I've have arrived early in categories, in karting, arrived early into single seater as well. And everything we are looking at is the performance really, not your age and how mature you have to be, and act to be professional at early age. And that's probably what he's going to face now. Yeah, we take positives. Definitely, for sure. The ending was not what we wanted, to be out of the points. But we were on for a very good lap as well, as Max said, when the red flag came, I was going to improve by quite a bit, and that would have changed completely the race weekend. But that's how Monaco goes. Unfortunately. And the pace, you know, for the team. It’s been good. Lando got the fastest lap, but we were just behind. We had good pace. And, you know, we were fighting inside the top 10. So, all in all, it's positive, it doesn't reflect the end result. But, you know, we're trying to make that different here.",Azerbaijan,friday,Alpine
Max Verstappen,"Like any other, to be honest. We just need to see through practice, what we can do with the car, see where we are at. And try to find the best balance and then hopefully, of course, we are going to be quick enough to try and win the race. No, because it's not our fault. So, there's nothing we can do. We just have completely different tyres anyway, this year, so the tyres are going to behave anyway very, very different. Don't know yet, to be honest. I think it's important to just go out there and see what we need from the car and then just work from there. No, I mean, we just have to focus on ourselves and they're very competitive. It’s good for the sport, and from our side, we enter every weekend to try and win the race. But it doesn't change if somebody else of another team says something. It's still all a bit vague as well, right? I mean, I think no one really knows where it's goping to go. But from my side, it's completely wrong. Because I think at the moment F1 is becoming more and more popular and everyone is making more and more money, including the teams, Formula 1 – everyone is benefiting. So, why should the drivers, with their IP rights and everything, be capped, [drivers] who actually bring the show and put their lives at risk? Because we do, eventually. So, for me, it's completely wrong. But also, not only that, because in all the junior categories, if you see how many of those drivers have a sponsor or backer, who eventually will have a certain percentage of their income in potentially Formula 1 or whatever, I think it's going to limit that a lot, because they will never get there return, in money, if you get a cap. So it will hurt all the junior categories as well. And I don't think you would want that. I definitely see, of course, Checo is a bit more comfortable than last year. For my side, yeah, I would like a bit more front end, that's what we're working at. I don't say like I'm uncomfortable in the car but these cars are so heavy, and long, and wide that, with increased weight as well, you want a car, which turns better, because it just goes faster around a corner. And you can extract a bit more in qualifying when you really push it, which cannot at the moment, but it's not all very dramatic. I mean, I still won four races. So, that's more than I did last year at this time. So, it's not that bad. It's just fine-tuning little things. Yeah, if he's capable of driving, and I don't see why not. You know, it shouldn't depend on age. You know, if he's 16 and he's capable of driving and he’s not a danger to others, then I think it's perfectly fine. My race was done on Saturday already after that red flag. Where I had to start fourth. And then that's how it goes. Then in the race, you know, you're the second car. So, you just follow the team's orders. And I think we did extremely well as a team, to get the cars where they ended-up. I think we all got also a bit lucky, you know, with backmarkers holding up Ferraris, and stuff like that. But that's fine. Monaco, you know, crazy things can happen. I was just a bit more disappointed about that Q3 Run where I couldn't finish my lap. But that's also Monaco. I mean, the same happened also, last year, Monaco but also here, in Baku, with a red flag. So, on a street circuit that's really easily done. And it's only one race weekend, we have so many more to go where normally you can overtake even if, let's say, there is a bit of a disappointment in qualifying. So, yeah, Monaco is probably just a bit of an unlucky one, if you're unlucky in qualifying, but it's okay. I mean, we're still leading the Championship. Of course, I retired twice already. So, to be even leading the Championship with the margin I have at the moment, I think is very positive. We just look ahead and a lot of things, good things, are coming, but hopefully it's going to be enough. Well, that's the thing. I didn't cross it. I rode on it. It was close, but it was also wet in the corner, so I naturally drifted that way. I think normally, you don't want to, let's say, put yourself in a position but also most of the pit exit lines you don't really need to. I knew it was going to be close. So, you have to, of course, use all the margin you have.",Azerbaijan,friday,Red Bull
Alex Albon,"Yeah, thank you. I love this track. I feel like it's quite a unique circuit in the way that it's quite repetitive in some ways, you know, you've got 90 degree corners everywhere and to get the lap time out of it, each one's slightly different in its own way, so I like that challenge. Obviously as a street track it’s very quick. And the racing is good. I don't think we've had a normal podium finish here in in a while. So it gives opportunity, which I think for a team like us, we'll take. Yeah, I think for us the main thing is we haven't had really any major updates. So of course, the majority of the teams have done that in Barcelona. We have some coming a bit later on. So there is the inevitable struggle at this point. That's not to say we can't do a good job here, though. It is a circuit that's a little bit more like Miami or Monaco. On paper, it may look like not a great weekend in Monaco, but the pace was pretty strong. So I think we can we can be opportunistic for this race, at least. And we'll see in Canada until hopefully the updates arrive at some There's no real big secret, I think all the teams operate in a very similar way. Of course, they have their own different styles of working and what have you, but it's not anything obvious. And if the weaknesses were obvious, we wouldn't be struggling so much. So, for us, it's more just about chipping away at it. And I think the mentality and the drive is there it’s just, you know, getting there. So we're working flat out right now to close the gap towards the midfield. I think that's really our prime objective, to get into the points and to be in those battles, getting into those Q2s. And yeah, I think in terms of where we need it's a very boring answer, but it's pace. We need we need a little bit more lap time in it.",Azerbaijan,friday,Williams
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was pretty good celebrations. And it was obviously a lot of excitement back home, because it was a great day for my country. You know to achieve the victory in in Monaco, it's something that as a driver you dream off for your entire career and achieving that is definitely very special. Yeah, certainly. Not just for me, I think for everyone, because in this world things change so quickly, literally from one race to the other, you know. You go from hero to zero in a matter of weeks. So, I think it's just important to keep pushing, keep making the most of your opportunities, and you never know when you're going to get the right opportunity in your career. I think Baku is all about confidence. It's all about not making mistakes, you know, because here what really can catch you out is making those mistakes and losing track time, starting on the backfoot and you can compromise your weekend fairly easily here. So it's very important to stay out of trouble. I think I've always enjoyed Baku. I've had good races here. I've had tough times also here. It can be very hectic. I generally enjoy it. And, yeah, it's certainly one of my favourite places to come in the year. So yeah, I'll tell you after Sunday if it is still as favourite as it is at the moment. It was signed on Friday before Monaco. We didn't discuss about that, there's nothing in my contract that says that I need to finish second or something like that, you know. So it was not a topic in the contract at all. Yeah, I certainly feel that as a driver you want certainty. And you want to get that stress out of the way. So the earlier the better. It takes so much so much energy and so much focus to be at 100% weekend by weekend that you don't need that thinking you know. So it was good that we agreed so early on the contract. And yeah, I feel like I’ve got a good opportunity. So the season is still very young, so anything can still happen from now. I think last year we obviously came in set-up regulations that had been there for a while. So people that stayed longer in the teams had good and bad advantage in that regard. So coming new to this car, this philosophy of car, it was very difficult for me to adapt and to always extract the maximum. It had a very unique driving style that took me a while to adapt to. At the end of the season it was fine, but it just took me too long throughout the season. And I think it's starting from zero it's a good opportunity for everyone. And especially given that it's my second season with Red Bull, I think that's something that makes it already a lot better, knowing my engineers, knowing the people around me. That's a big step. And yeah, the car, I feel comfortable with it and I'm able to extract the maximum.",Azerbaijan,friday,Red Bull
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, I don’t miss the shoey, that's for sure! No, but it was a great day, great memories you know, I love the track. It's always a great challenge coming here. You know, the race on Sunday is always exciting. There's always opportunity to overtake and yeah, it just always makes for an exciting race on Sunday. And, yeah, looking forward to the weekend. No, I don't think we were doing anything wrong last year in terms of strategy, I think it was an unexpected tyre failure. And I hope it doesn't happen again. It wasn't fun having a tyre failure at those speed. We had great pace and we were on for a good race and those kinds of things are never fun. So hopefully it doesn't happen again. Well, I think we're learning every weekend. It's a very different package to what we started the season with. So I think every weekend we're just gaining knowledge, understanding our car. Now this is a very different track to Monaco. So I think we'll see how we go this weekend. But we're definitely learning every weekend about the strengths and weaknesses of this car, the areas we’ve got to work on and I think we're only getting better understanding the car and that's a good thing.",Azerbaijan,friday,Aston Martin
Yuki Tsunoda,"Well, I’m always looking forward to every race weekend. Last year I got a good result here, qualifying and the race as well. But I think yeah it’s a bit of a different situation last year. I think the car was really good and it helped me to be able to be in that kind of position. Still, I like this track, it’s a nice street circuit. So I think as a team as well, we are feeling more confident than in the previous races. I think, in general, as a team, we had a good result there [last year] and Pierre got P3 as well. So, yeah, hopefully we can achieve those things in this race weekend as well. I think we started very good. From FP1 to FP3 we were consistently in the top 10. Qualifying… I think definitely one of the biggest reason was my contacting with the wall and causing the red flag. And made slightly the planning we'd done before the session completely messed up and Pierre couldn't get across the line before the chequered flag. So that was a biggest reason. And also for my side, I got a damage as well in early stages so I couldn't go through to Q3 as well. So definitely there was potential to go through to Q3. So it was a big shame for the team. But I think we learned a lot of things also from the race as well. So hopefully we don't have that kind of situation in the future. And yeah, currently we just have to extract the performance from the car as much as possible and score points. Yeah, I think first we need a clean race week, to have an exact idea what position we we're fighting for now, and also for the future to develop the car. But I think we have good confidence that we can achieve a clean race week. We learned a lot of things. We did a lot of mistakes already, so as a team we have shown that we can improve from there, and I'm also happy with the team, what we are doing now. Also I’ll try to help as much as possible with my performance to have a clean race week.",Azerbaijan,friday,AlphaTauri
Daniel Ricciardo,"Very much so, it’s a great track. Yeah, it's just fun, high speed. We’ve got three street circuits in a row now, which is cool. I think they're all unique in a way. But I think every street circuit kind of poses the same challenges and that risk reward factor is always there, pretty much all the way around the lap. From a set-up point of view is very different to Monaco. You know, you run lower downforce than in Monaco, because the straights and the speeds are much different. But yeah, the kind of the flow and stuff in the middle sector, there are some similarities as well. I welcome everything. I mean, 2017 was one of the most crazy races I was ever involved in. So I welcome that. Yeah, reviewing, I think reviewing a race weekend, especially when it's not, let's say a good result, you'll always kind of look back in hindsight and say ‘well, yeah, OK, maybe this or that’. I think we started on the front foot and I think we were kind of in a good place and then it kind of just got a little away from us, where we understood a bit after that, and a few days after the race, you know, I spoke to the team with an analysis and then I was in the factory on Monday and the sim and a few other bits and pieces there as well with the team. So, we've definitely done our work and we come into today with a few bits and pieces, which we're going to explore on the car just to try to get me kind of back in that place. But, yeah, full confidence moving ahead now. Well, I guess at the end of the day, people care you know. I think it's why I'm probably being talked about finishing 13th, because people know that I can be better. And I guess it speaks to my results in the past. And I guess me, as a driver, people believe in me, simply. I also don't expect an amazing narrative when I cross the line in 13th. But yeah, I like pressure. It's a good platform to perform on. And it's also why I signed up to this. I love it. Success after struggle always tastes a little sweeter. So that's what I look forward to it. Absolutely. I think there's still… Probably, like all of us, there are still ways to perfect these cars and the updates. So yeah, we're certainly still like experimenting and trialling a few bits and pieces. And obviously, personally, I still feel I can get more out of this car. So yes to all the above. Well, if the mic wasn't on earlier, strong. It’s beautiful. I liked the stroke you did with the beard. It was like a kind of a double brush, which was nice. I look forward to actually seeing you here in person soon so I can touch it myself. I'll sanitise, it's OK. So, sim stuff. I think the sim is one part of the learning, the development, but also just going through analysis of the race and all other bits and pieces, which we will do with the engineers and the team. And also the factory, you know. Not everyone travels to the races, so it's a chance to also speak to some factory-based personnel. And just go through a lot of it. I definitely feel in a good place coming into this weekend. I think that's one thing where a weekend like Monaco. Yeah, it's not the result I want but once we've done the homework then I put it behind me and look forward. Yeah, fully focused and confident ahead of Baku now. You have the opposite. You have no beard at the moment. Visually it's hard to get used to this. It's really extremes. Well, firstly we've spoken. We've had a catch up. But nothing really needed to be kind of elaborated on. I think sometimes I'm guilty of it as well, getting caught up in the media, and not always kind of making total sense of things. I just like to talk. No, the clarity is clear for us moving forward. My contracts clear with the team, until the end of next year I'm fully committed. I’ve certainly voiced that. And it’s obviously now just on track to show it and show these moments and these races that I know I'm capable of. And I do truly believe that I have the full support of the team and we want to do it together. I wasn't surprised. I don’t know, maybe I’ve become a little bit immune, if that's the word, to media. I think I’ve been in the sport for so long and I think we actually do more and more as we go through the years. So, I don't I don't really take it probably for its full value or worth all the time. And I know that some things are taken out of context. So I'm not really one to go into it and read too much and try to understand it. At the end of the day, I guess I know the facts between us and know I have with the team, so yeah, simply I don't get caught up. So I guess I'm not surprised with anything these days, beard or no beard. Probably a good thing. I mean, certainly it has its challenges. But I think stripping it back to the core, I still know what I can do, I still believe I have it and it's not, you know, it's not like a place of like low confidence or low self-esteem or anything, where I'm like, ‘I don't think it's possible’. I really do. I know I can still do it. I think in this sport everything operates at such a high level and if something's a little bit out of tune, then it can have a bit of a carry-on effect. So it's really just for me to get back into that place where I'm in tune, fully in tune, with the car and then it'll come. I have felt it before, you know, so I think it could come at any circuit and I think from then it will probably start to build again, some nice rhythm. A little bit like the second half of last year, where we started to build some of that. Just get back to that place. It's not as far away as it probably seems. So I've confidence that it can happen quickly. Yeah, it's a massive sabotage! I mean, even with the changes this year, there are certainly still some things, which, you could kind of say carry over from last year's car and some of the, how do I say…. Like, some things the car did last year, I think it still does this year, if that makes sense. So it's still trying to get on top of that. But it's a place where I didn't really find I'd say these issues, as you said, maybe in the past, and that's why it's something a little bit new or unfamiliar for me. But, as I said, it's taken longer than I would have liked to obviously get the results and the consistency, week in, week out, but it's not far off. I don't want to keep talking about Monza. But there were obviously times last year, where I was able to show that I can make it work with this car. And I do think we're closer this year than last year, funnily enough, so, I’m just going across the line now with less people in front of me and more behind me and everything’s sweet. Absolutely not. No. That's one thing I certainly want to… There is a level of, as Checo said, signing early in a season gives you some comfort, but that comfort shouldn't be… I'm going to use a word here that I don't think is [right]… Is it misconstrued? Yes! [Shouldn’t be] misconstrued with complacency. Absolutely not. And, you know, it's as simple as this: my results, I want them to be better, I know they can be better and I want to enjoy that success with the team. So I'm not going to just sit back in 13th and be complacent or happy about that. Not at all.",Azerbaijan,friday,McLaren
Valtteri Bottas,"Definitely I was expecting more. When we came into the weekend, naturally, as our car has been good in slow-speed corners we thought it would be one of the best opportunities this year but it didn't quite happen. And I think it's quite a unique track in terms of the bumpiness, the warps, the cambers on the track, in the corners. So I think mechanically we probably didn't quite get the most out of the car. And I think it was a good lesson. I think we've learned a lot from that weekend that hopefully can possibly help us this weekend. Hopefully it's better. I mean, every track except Monaco we've been pretty strong compared to the midfield. So this is slightly more towards normal type of track, although it is a street track, and a bumpy one, but like I said, with the learnings from Monaco, hopefully, we're going to be good. See the chequered flag, that's the number one thing, because here you just never know. The qualifying position is maybe not a crucial as in other places. But yeah, in the race, stay out of trouble, make the right calls with a strategy. This race is always exciting, and I look forward to it. I think it's a valid point. And that that can happen, because in the end when you come up the different categories you need financial support and eventually the investors who invest in you they are expecting a good payback. And if that is being limited, with already being this big risk for the investor, it will become an even bigger risk. I'm sure no driver is voting for the salary cap, because we feel like we earn a decent amount from doing what we do, risking our life and working as hard as we can and actually being the centre of the show, let's say, F1 is really booming at the moment, you know, we're doing more and more engagement with the fans, more and more work off the track. And, yeah, for me, it doesn't quite make sense that at this time that F1 is going up that the drivers’ salaries should go down, I think one would be better than two or three. That's my feeling, you know. Have same person in each race. You always have the same person to discuss with if he's been in all the races before and taking all the feedback and he kind of knows our view. That’s my opinion. I think one is better.",Azerbaijan,friday,Alfa Romeo
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, obviously disappointed, you know. The whole weekend was probably our best weekend of the season so far. And yeah, that one session that we had to make sure not to miss or do any mistakes, unfortunately we got it wrong. And we paid… Pretty big consequences. Because starting from the back in Monaco, it's never going to make your Sunday easy and very hard to recover. Apart from that, a lot of positives to take away from that weekend in terms of performance, the whole Friday, Saturday, we showed some good pace and even on Sunday, you know, in the end, I'm really happy with the performance we showed on Sunday, even though in the end we didn't score points, we still managed to recover a couple of good positions you know. I enjoyed these conditions in Monaco, which were very extreme, and I tried to make a couple of moves on a difficult track, so I think everything was great apart from our terrible qualifying which cost because cost us the lot. Why not? Why not? You know, everything can happen in Baku. We saw a lot of drama in the past years. We saw quite unexpected results and podiums, so I want to be optimistic about this weekend and also just the track layout. You know, it's only low-speed corners and we know usually that's where we tend to be the most competitive compared to other tracks with higher-speed corners, so I think it's looking good. Hopefully we can start and kick our season off properly, because since the start of the year it hasn't been the start we would have liked and now I feel Baku can be a definitely a good starting point. Well, at the moment it’s not a question of looking outside or looking anywhere. I think my contract situation is pretty clear with Red Bull. And yeah, it's just, you know, an ongoing conversation with Helmut and the management to know what's best for all of us. But as I said, you know, to me it’s been very logical to sign Checo who has been competitive since the start of the year. So yeah, I mean, no surprise on that side. Obviously it impacts what's going to happen for my career in the coming years. And based on that, we just need to we just need to have normal conversation on what's best going forward. At the moment, as I say, these are conversations that are ongoing. I mean, I have nothing more to add. The right decision will be made at the right time. I know why I'm here. I know what I want to achieve in Formula 1. I'm a competitive guy and the only thing that matters to me is performance. You know, we are F1 drivers, here to fight for wins, poles, championships, and that's what drives me every single day. That's why I'm pushing myself beyond my limits every single time. And at the end of the day, that's what will make the difference. But, as I say, for now it's a matter of performing with AlphaTauri and will take the decision at the right time. I completely agree with Valtteri. You know, I think he’s good to two valid points and that's what we said. We know it's an expensive sport. We know to make it today to Formula 1, to finance all your career through, even just through karting and coming through Formula 4, Formula 3, Formula 2, we're talking like big numbers and you need financial support. People need to take risk to invest in yourself if they see potential and it's normal that these people expect returns. And if we start to put this salary cap for sure it's not going to push these people to help young drivers. And I've had a lot of friends unfortunately who would have needed this backing when they were younger and they had the talent to make their way up. And unfortunately they didn't have the chance. And I don't think by moving that direction we're going to give more opportunities to these young talents without financial backing. So, I think we’ve got to be careful on that side. And as Valtteri said, as well, the sport is booming. We have more and more races, more and more interest. I think financially F1 is really growing, which is a very positive thing and very positive for everybody involved in the business. And exactly, it doesn't really make sense to cap us at the time when they asking us for more. But think this is just a side comment. I think this knock-on effect it could have on the younger guys and young talents is not really going in the direction that will be beneficial for the entire sport. Well, when it ends, yes. Before that I don't have much to add on what has been said. So, I think, as I said, my contract situation is quite clear. There are ongoing discussions, but I just don't have anything more to add for now.",Azerbaijan,friday,AlphaTauri
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it was not easy, but at the same time thanks to Red Bull, it’s why I made it to Formula 1 way I am a Formula 1 driver right now and I'm enjoying a career, no? It's a difficult trade, but I understand what Pierre is going through. I went through something relatively similar. At the time maybe it caused me a couple of bad situations or bad moments with Red Bull but now I remain good friends with Helmut with Christian and I only have grateful words for them, you know. I can understand both positions. It's a very difficult trade between where you want to be but at the same time being loyal to the ones who have trusted in you. What I can tell you is that Pierre for me is a very good driver that is always performing on track and it’s normal that he has high expectations and wants to go and find a place where he can fight for wins and some poles so I understand, as I said, both positions. For sure, with the benefit of hindsight we would have done a couple of things differently.  Not so much on my side but probably more maybe on the other side of the garage. But for me it was a pretty straightforward race. I think we nailed the strategy I was leading before everyone had to go into slicks. I was the race leader at that time. So I think we did the right strategy call and then for details like the pit stop gap to Latifi and then having to be stuck behind him for two sectors then it was what cost me the race win. But on my side could we have done something differently? Looking back at it if I would have pitted one lap earlier I would have more margin with Checo but I had different traffic in my window. If I would have pitted one lap late I would have probably got undercut by Checo. So it's just shows that in Formula 1 for winning everything needs to be on your side. It needs to be extremely detailed and it needs to click you know, that everything goes your way one day, and it wasn't meant to be for me day in Monaco. But I’m confident I drove well and I could have been the race winner with a bit more luck. There's always a trade and I think you can get to a race win or a good result following both directions. You can be a bit quicker in the corners or a bit quicker on the straight. All our simulations are fairly flat in telling you that the lap time is going to be the same going one way or the other you know, so you just need to pick your trade, trust your process, your instinct and make sure you have a car that gives you confidence, because here you need a lot of braking confidence, to brake late and to be close to a wall. So it's a great challenge for us drivers but also for teams in terms of setting up the car and I think it's a great circuit. I enjoy coming here and it's been good for Formula 1, I think, Baku recently. I agree. You just need to see what it costs, you know, to run an F2, an F3 campaign nowadays. We're talking about millions of euros and whose father has one or two millions in the bank to spend for his son to compete in a racing category without knowing that he's going to make it to Formula 1. And if on top of that then you tell them that when he gets to Formula 1, he's going to get capped after wasting two million to run in F2. Who's going to be interested in investing? No, I think it's a very fair point. Also for junior teams like Ferrari and Red Bull, it's a complicated matter. But more than anything, is it the right thing to do nowadays? If you tell me Formula 1 is in crisis because of COVID and the sport is going in a bad direction, the drivers are earning too much for what the sport is generating, then I would tell you, maybe there's a chance or a point where we can all agree that maybe there is something that could be done. But when the sport is booming? You guys were all in Miami. You saw the amount of events, the amount of things we were doing, how busy we've been recently as racing drivers and we just keep hearing that the championship is going to grow to 25 races, even 30 in the future. And now when the sport is booming, you want to cap us, no? I find it a very illogical idea right now. And an idea that makes very little sense for where the sport is at the moment. So yeah, for me, it's more a matter of whether it's the right thing or the wrong thing to do in the specific time for Formula 1. Nothing to add. I agree. Honestly, with a guard that we have this year, any track we go to is a good winning opportunity. Then. if there is a track that suits a bit more the Red Bull or the Ferrari then it's on the detail. Also, I think Mercedes, if they perform like they did in Barcelona, I think they're going to join the fight pretty soon. But as a driver I'm lucky enough this year to know that I have a car that wherever I go to the car is going to be there or thereabouts. If the last 10th is in favour of Red Bull because of the straight line we have here or if it's in favour of us because we saw that in Monaco in Quali we had the edge over them over the corners and on slow-speed corners, then it's welcome. So it's going to be tight, but any race that we go to is a good opportunity.",Azerbaijan,friday,Ferrari
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, I think that the positives are you know, we came through Monaco, well, through the FPs though obviously we missed out on FP1, and then kind of played catch-up until qualifying. But then actually in qualifying, we were all quite close. You know, we weren't expecting to be as close to Valtteri and I think we were, so that's already a good positive. And then yeah, I think in the race, we chose the right strategy direction in terms of going from full wets to intermediates, and then going to slicks quite early on. Well, we were kind of forced to go to slicks due to the front wing being missing. But yeah overall I think we had everything… We have a lot of things which we can take away from there that are positives, but obviously the negatives are especially the ones we have to learn from. I was fine. Obviously, the impact was, was not actually that harsh and I was kind of surprised to see the car in two pieces. Well, it's important for me, but also for the team. Obviously we are kind of tight on spare parts and therefore have to be really cautious on that side. But nonetheless we're still trying to perform and get the points. And that's what we're aiming for here. Yeah, I think I agree with all of them. All of the points are valid, and I think that they're good. I think there's nothing I can add to that, in the sense that I think would definitely be the wrong way. Everybody's happy about the direction of Formula 1 at the moment and I think we, as drivers, obviously not only the younger drivers, but also we as drivers now, we travel the world basically and have nearly no private life at the end. And you know, it's all our life F1. So if we do spend all our time in it, I think, in a sense it would be a shame to not get rewarded for it. Well, I have had the discussions with him. Quite easy. I mean, you know, it's no secret, and we all want to score points and that's what we're what we're here for. And we want to want to do better than previous races. Not saying that the races weren't good, but, you know, there was always something which just didn't quite work out. So I think that we are in a good way.",Azerbaijan,friday,Haas
George Russell,"I don't remember saying that, to be honest! No, I think there’s no secret, we obviously brought some big changes to the car in Barcelona and it kind of changed our whole philosophy a little bit and where the strengths of our car were and the weaknesses were. And obviously, Monaco is a very unique race weekend altogether. So I think this will be slightly more in line with the performance we saw in Barcelona. Hopefully it would be faster. But I think I don't think it's necessarily much faster at the moment but it's given us a direction where we think we can get a lot more out of it, whereas the car we had in Bahrain, that was sort of its maximum potential, and we couldn’t really improve it from there on in. Sometimes you got to take a small step back to take three steps forward. And I think we're in that transitional process at the moment. And I think it'll be a few more races before we started to see us hopefully fighting with the Ferrari and Red Bull. Yeah, I think, yes, it’s definitely welcome in our position, I don't think it's going to be straightforward. I think we'd love to be straight on the pace here but I think we'll be in our usual position, just sort of behind the front two, and probably just ahead of the midfield group. There's some really fast guys out there in the low speed corners and that could throw up a bit of a surprise. But hopefully, come Sunday we'll be able to recover that. And yeah, let's see. It's definitely welcome. As long as we're on the right side of it, it’s all good. Yeah, definitely. You got to look at the positives. And you've got to look at things rationally. And we can't be disappointed that we haven't won a race this season with the package we've had. And we're in this development phase and I think it's been pretty well optimised. As a team, I think we've done a great job to maximise the points available to us. So you've got to take that as a positive and try and continue this momentum forward. And hopefully when we have a faster car, we'll be in good shape to fight for those victories. Nothing more to add. Yeah, I think it's been not a bad start to the season, personally. I think there’s definitely room to improve in certain areas. And I think, obviously, I’m in a really privileged position, being teammates with Lewis and learning so much from him, how he works, how he goes about his business with his engineers, how he gets the whole team motivated. It's quite inspiring to see. Also, on the technical side he’s pretty impressive, which a lot of people probably wouldn't really recognise or appreciate. So, yeah, definitely room to improve. But I think in terms of results, it's been fine. And yeah, I don't think we could have probably achieved much higher results when I look at the season rationally. I think probably other than Bahrain, we probably finished as high as we could in every single race. As I said, from Barcelona it was effectively a completely new car for us. So we have basically done two races this season with this iteration of car – one of which was Monaco, where we took little or no learning, because it's such a unique race track. And we think we can now start to build from this foundation. So mainly the aero side of things, making sure we don't go into any of the porpoising issues we faced earlier, but just bringing more performance to the car, which we have confidence we can achieve. But ultimately, it's always relative. We don't know what Red Bull and Ferrari have in the pocket. So, as I said before, if we bring half a second and they bring half a second, we're in the same boat.",Azerbaijan,friday,Mercedes
Sebastian Vettel,"Well, obviously, it was very tricky on Sunday with the conditions. I had one mistake that cost me probably ninth position, which was going wide and/or long and deep into turn one. But yeah, other than that I think it was what we could do on that day. So I don't think we had a chance to really score much more than that: as I said, ninth or tenth was probably the maximum on the day. So yeah, I was very pleased.  Obviously looking where I'm coming from, from all those years before, ninth or tenth is not what makes you really feel excited about but I guess you could ask the same question to Fernando, or this year probably a little bit to Lewis. So, you know, we are in a way dependent on the package that we have. But nevertheless the work that goes into it from the team’s side, everybody’s side is big and there's a big push in trying to improve our car.  We had a big package that basically is a new car which takes some understanding, what we believe is the better direction for the future, the next couple of races, and now we're waiting for - obviously - the next package to arrive to give us more performance. Well, it was only two weeks after Barcelona, and it's a street circuit and it was wet so I think we are learning is the answer and also Monaco, you know, with Monaco’s limitations helped us to understand further. But yeah, here we have another chance, Canada… aren't necessarily proper racetracks but still, places where tuning the car to the best possible place can make a difference. Yeah, I like it. It's a bit of a rhythm-breaker track,  a lot of big stops, but yeah, I think it can be a nice track. So yeah, I think it's important to get into the rhythm and feel comfortable with the car. So then I believe it's a place where we can also make a difference. Yeah, I think Lewis summed it up really well. I don't think there's much point going into what has been said but I think what I would like to say is that the topics that Lewis is continuing to raise, the issues Lando has been talking about, and I think stuff that I've been mentioning, I believe… I feel they are topics that are very important to be addressed. And they are bigger than us, bigger than a sport can ever be, so I think, yeah, it is important to mention those, to express those and to raise awareness, to make people aware that there's still lots of things that we can improve on. I would like Fernando to start. Nothing to add. I think it's wrong to have a salary cap for, you know, the reasons that Lewis mentioned. I think it's interesting if you follow up where it is coming from, this proposal. Obviously we have a budget cap now which, you know, pushes the model towards earnings for all the teams. And yeah, I think maybe they should be capped in terms of having certain fixed earnings and everything beyond that should, I don't know, go to a certain pool to do great things with it and have positive impact. And I think there's… as it is a suggestion I can imagine that the response will be that it’s a topic will disappear. So I’ll leave it to you. Isn't it a funny coincidence that it’s the first time that teams can actually make money with racing in Formula 1 and something like the salary cap for drivers pops up? Just thinking… isn't that funny?",Azerbaijan,friday,Aston Martin
Fernando Alonso,"So I hope so. I think at the beginning of the year, arguably we were more competitive than the last two weekends, but we didn't score points on Sunday: reliability issues, mistakes,  bad luck, you know, so yeah, Barcelona, Monaco, we finally scored some good points. And the aim is to have six or seven consecutive races in the points. So let's see on Sunday here. I think we were close maybe in Australia. At the beginning of the year we were more competitive than what we are now which I think Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes… they are a little bit too far at the moment. So yeah, we are maybe not in that position on merit to fight for the podium. Now maybe P7 is the first opportunity or the first position we are fighting for but let's see. I think Baku is a very unique race with a lot of things happening on Sunday. It’s a street race, yes, but Saturday maybe is not the priority, it’s more Sunday’s pace and being focused on any opportunities that may come with safety cars or red flags or whatever as we saw last year, so yeah, looking forward. I think we all want some action on Sunday. It is a very unique racetrack as we all said here and very low downforce to be on a street circuit. We are normally full downforce as in Monaco, Singapore, and here we come with a very low downforce car, which is prone to mistakes in qualifying,  and the race. So I think it's going to be some action anyway. OK. You know, I have full trust in the FIA President. Yes, that will be my answer. So if things are, at the moment, maybe a little bit rough and we saw a few things that maybe at the beginning of the year that they were not consistent, as we wished or as we asked for but I think there is room to improve, yes, but as I said I have full trust in the FIA President, so he will fix the things that need to be fixed. That's why I wanted Seb to answer. No, no. Well, it depends how… what is the cap? But I don't think so. I think we all love, you know, to race and…but it is true also what Lewis said, you know, and I think we do more things than ever before now and there are 23 or 25 races, there are events everywhere. Sponsors are coming back to F1, to all the teams, FOM, I mean we're doing more things than ever before. So, yeah, we will all have to work together, you know, and…",Azerbaijan,friday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"Loads of them! I think after every race we go through a process where we just try and analyse the race that we've just done and obviously in Monaco, there was plenty to analyse, because we've done some mistakes. But what gives me the confidence for the future is that we found the reasons why we did those mistakes as a team. To go into details now I won’t but overall, I think we've got those answers that we were searching for and this is good news for the future. A repeat of those exact same mistakes? I'm confident, yes. Then we just obviously need to focus on ourselves, don't do any other mistakes and if we do everything perfect, I'm sure that we can have a great result this weekend. I'm pretty sure that everybody will be on low downforce. I'll be very surprised if I see a car on high downforce here. I don't know. I think we'll have to see where is our weakness after the first day. I'm pretty sure that we are lacking a little bit of straight-line speed compared to Red Bull. Whether this will be the direction to take after today I'm not sure yet. But last year, I think we qualified a bit out of position and then in the race we came back to the position we deserved really. This year, we have a much more competitive car so I hope that if we do pole on Saturday that we can keep that on Sunday. Yeah, I mean I will comment mostly on the sporting side but speaking about sporting I think I would like to see a bit more consistency. This is where we need to improve, whether it will be improved or not I don't know, but I think, yeah, as Fernando said, there's room for improvement. Now we just need to make things better.",Azerbaijan,friday,Ferrari
Nicholas Latifi,"Yeah, it's been a track I've tended to go quite well at in the past. I mean it's a very unique one, obviously, it has a very repetitive feel to it with the way the lay-out of the corners is kind of very similar, 90 degree-style corners, so I think if you just find that right rhythm with the driving and combined with the car as well - because you’ve just kind of got to set up the car for that sweet spot - then you could be fast, but likewise if you don't quite find that feeling, as all the corners are very similar you can get it wrong. So yeah, I've just tended to - I guess - be on the better side of that and then in the races as well, I guess the approach when there tends to be quite a lot going on, obviously was always the same in Formula 2, as it has been in Formula 1, I think there's only been probably one not so exciting F1 race here in the past. You just kind of got to make sure you see the chequered flag, and hope you're in a good position to capitalise on some stuff at the end. Tricky to say. I think on the tracks this year, when we've wanted to be a bit quick in the straight line, we've seemed to be quite competitive so I think that should bode well for us here then at the same time that may be balanced that out. I think the layout of the corners is not one that's going to suit the strengths of the car. So yeah, it'll be tricky to see but yeah, we'll see come qualifying. Yeah, I mean I guess speaking on the sporting side, I mean, I think, obviously, at the beginning of this year there were some structural changes and obviously, we have two new Race Directors as well. So, I mean, I think I would echo the opinion of most drivers that I think we want most is consistency. But I do think we just need to give some time for this new structure, for everyone to feel comfortable in it, and then obviously once maybe that happens there will be some more consistency. But yeah, there has been some things that could definitely be improved. So yeah, I think we just need to give everyone a bit of time to sort that out.",Azerbaijan,friday,Williams
Lewis Hamilton,"Where's that feeling coming from? I love that, this collective positive mood from everyone. I hope that's the case! Lots of work is going on. I'm hoping that it's not as bumpy as Monaco but we'll find out when we get out there today. And yeah, like everyone was saying, lower downforce should be better. I hope so. Not particularly, but yeah, when you talk about cars’ strengths, it's… I don't know which ones we can align to. We're obviously stronger on a smoother circuit. Barcelona was a lot better for us, for example. So there's more open circuits that aren't as bumpy. This is a bumpier circuit so not necessarily great for the characteristics within our car, but it might be smoother than… as I said might be smooth and might be okay. Yes. I mean I can't really say too much about it because it's not even… I don't know if it's been properly announced yet but it's something we're working on in the background and a super-exciting project, long time in the waiting. And I can't really say much more, I guess, about it. I don't plan to be in it, no. I can't give you that information just yet. But it's a really cool project and we're already working on a script, for example. I'm very much involved in the script, which is fun and spending good time with Brad, which is pretty epic, and seeing his progress. And I guess really from my responsibility and something  that I take on is just making sure that the cast and the crew in the background is diverse, is something I'm really highlighting at the beginning. And then just making sure that know… it's been a… it's a very difficult… If you look at all the racing movies… I can't necessarily say that all the recent movies that have been in the past have been spectacular and that's something we want to change. And it's really about showing how great this sport really is to people that maybe have never watched it, but also making sure that we really keep the real heritage and the true racing spirit within the movie, and within the scripts. So that's kind of my… part of my role. It’s very surreal and what a huge honour it is. Surprised like everyone else yesterday when I heard about it. No one contacted me and told me. We just heard about it in the news. So I don't think I've ever really heard of anyone else being… I’ve not heard of that happening. I'm sure it maybe does in other places. But Brazil has always been a place that I've loved and admired as a kid. Obviously, following Ayrton you naturally are drawn to the country, but through my life just meeting more and more Brazilian and knowing more about the culture and the community and it's very, very diverse there, there's a lot of energy, music, colour and I've had some… just over the years, just amazing times there. Obviously won my first World Championship in Brazil. And to then 14 years later whatever it is, the epic race that I had there last year, and the moment I had with the Brazilian flag, so I'm really… that's my like biggest following is in Brazil, so I'm very, very honoured and grateful and can't wait to spend more time there. I only heard about it this morning. I've not read it so I don't really know all that there has been said. I'm also aware that sometimes I've been take… things that I've said have been taken out of context and so I want to give that… that maybe has happened, I don't know. But it's… I heard that he clarified things on social media which is positive. And that doesn't stop us from doing what we're doing. The sport is continuously growing. We have a bigger audience than ever before. I think it's gone up like 9 percent I think it is this year or something. And it continues to be an important platform to use our voices, every single one of us here within the industry, within our companies to do more to speak out more on things, to spark more conversations and just look now for example, I'm really proud of what we're doing and Mercedes with our pride month, our pride star on the car, which is like the first time I've seen that during my time at Mercedes which is amazing.  Just shows up… you know, we have over 100,000 people within Mercedes Benz and creating a more inclusive environment is so important and focusing on creating better diversity within your organisation, but also so important within the sport. It's moving at a very slow pace and we need more people to utilise their platform. So I encourage all the drivers to be more outspoken in future and speak about things they care about. And I'm proud to see what Seb does and to be an ally of his. I mean, the car wasn’t maxed out in Bahrain but we were very limited with what we could do, in a sense of not knowing what was causing the problem and therefore you can't manoeuvre into a direction if you don't know where it's coming from. So yes, our new… the new direction that we've got to in  Barcelona has given us a more of a direction to go in and it's been positive, I would say, so far. It's not working everywhere but it's.. can I say it's the best process… most exciting journey? No, but it is an experience, it’s bringing the team closer, it's making us all having to sharpen our tools. The technology is advancing a lot, to be able to understand it. And so it's…  and we're pulling closer than ever before so I think we're a more tight unit team than we've ever been. And I guess that's what happens when you're faced with adversity. And so there's lots and lots of positives from it. Yeah, I really don't have much to say. I would just listen to what people are saying. Yeah, we have to have confidence that they're…  that they will continue to make progress. I think it's about collaboration, so I generally think that there's been… that a good job has been done so far. I think it will get better with… particularly, you know, we are trying to work with the FIA and I think for Mohammed, I think it's a huge role, big shoes to fill, and I think we just need to give him time. There's a lot that he wants to do, and lots of things that he wants to change and I believe, from what he's told us. that he will do those. It's a difficult question to answer. I don't really have all the facts. And I don't really… have not really spent time thinking too much about it. So I can't give you a factual answer on what is right or wrong. I think there is some merit in what Geroge [sic] has expressed. I think there's many of us that have been here who have had been heavily invested in as youngsters and have had to pay that back which you would naturally want to do anyway. And so that, for sure, could be impacted in the future for the younger generation. Also, we have to remember that this sport has gone from what is it, like a $4-$6 billion business to a $14 billion dollar business. It’s consistently growing, the teams are earning more money than ever before. So… and we are a huge part of that. And so… look, I won't be here for like a huge amount longer but I do think about the next the younger generation and I don't feel that they should be kept. I don't know. We're going to need drivers, I'm sure, at some stage so I was, I think… what’s really important is that it's not my movie, it's Formula 1 so it's for all of us. And so there's lots of people within the sport who are being a part of this, helping educate those who are trying to create this movie. So it's going include lots and lots of people. And there's always this talk of already how are we going to capture some of the footage and it's going to take us drivers to be involved in that. But we're not actors so we don't want this movie to be crap. So it wasn't putting bad actors in, so yeah, which is probably why I'm not going be a part of it also. We need some good actors.",Azerbaijan,friday,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"It was, it was, but I felt like we did everything that we had to do out there. We stayed patient on the wets, we took the right decision to go onto the slick, and yeah, a lapped car or a terrible out lap stuck behind a lapped car cost me a race win today, so you can understand the frustration because a clean out lap would have secured me the race win today but it's how the sport is sometimes. Yeah, I knew it from halfway through a race. The first stint, sorry. I started to see the dry line and I started to realise that it was going to go straight into slicks. I think we did the right call, as we were leading the race basically. Then we pitted it for that hard tyre. Obviously hard is never easy on the out lap but I had to do 12 corners or something like that behind the lapped car that cost me at least a couple of seconds and that cost me a race win. Anyway, I'm not going complain too much. I know that this sport is like that. Checo was unlucky in Jeddah. Obviously today he did a great race, plus he got a bit lucky with myself and in this sport it will turn around one day or later. You can see I have quite a lot of graining myself too, especially at the rear, which made the entry to the tunnel quite difficult to get close and to pass. A couple of times, I was really, really close to launching a move into there, but it was still a bit wet on the inside. Checo was braking quite late. so I think if I would have braked any later I would have taken him out with me. No, I think that as a team we… There were some very tough calls to be made out there and a lot of communications going on on the radio to see what we could do. I knew that by staying out on the wets I would earn the race lead at some point and by the time I was on the race lead I saw that it was going to be very close to going on slicks. The track was drying up super-quickly and at that point we decided to go until the slick. We put on the slick, the hard tyre, and on the out lap actually the tyre felt really good after using a wet that is super slippery. On the hard tyre it felt pretty grippy, but with tough luck that we were in the gearbox of a Williams or a lapped car that did a very slow Sector 1 and 2 and in the end let me by. This cost me one or two seconds of race time that was enough for Checo to overcut me. It was tempting. It was tempting into the chicane but unfortunately the track was still a bit wet on the inside. So if I go and brake late in there, it would have been a bit of a mess. And I probably could have taken Checo out with me. Tempting in a couple of other places. But realistically, with these big wide cars, the spaces are really narrow and even on a drying track, where there's damp patches offline, It's almost impossible. And I tried everything I could to nearly launch a move, but even when I did, I nearly took him with me. So yeah, I think I did everything I could. I don't know. But it doesn't matter really. Monaco is not, as you said, today's not about who is the fastest, it's about who gets all the timing of the pitstops right, and all the strategy calls right.  Red Bull went for the Inters; we decided to stay out on Wets. I mean, I was on the race lead before this leg, so you could argue, I think today we did the right choices; it was the timing of that lapped car really that cost us a lot today. I think I… did I bump you? Because two times I said ‘I'm gonna make him spin’ because you were so slow. Where did we lose it? We lost it obviously with very good in-lap there from Checo, I guess, that you also need to give a prize to him as a driver and the team Red Bull that they did a very good in-lap – but we lost it in the out-lap. I mean to have to hold Sector One and Two behind a lapped car, a Williams that was on Hard tyres, struggling with warm-up. I was getting really frustrated on the radio because I knew this… Checo was going to be fast in the lap, with the Inter, and I was having a very poor out-lap on the Hard because of the traffic. This is how it is. We would have boxed one lap earlier, one lap later, maybe the track position would have been different at the time. And maybe, I wouldn't have had a lapped car that would have been in front of us. But especially in the wet, it's very difficult to calculate how long you're going to be through the pits, because the pit entry and the pit exit are wet. So the team doesn't have a clear indication or idea of where you're going to come out. Because the pit exit and pit entry times vary quite a lot. We were relatively unlucky, I guess, to just come out in the gearbox of a Williams that was struggling with warm-up at the time. And this is where the race went away. Yeah, I was. Actually when you tell me this, I'm in a good mood, because the race should have ended there. But, I think we were both lapping lapped cars? Yeah, right before the VSC. I think they were obviously staying in the dry line. And if you wanted to pass them, you had to go on the wet, on a Hard tyre, on a cold Hard tyre. And the main straight turns right a little bit. So I went on the damp patch and suddenly the car gave me a massive oversteer moment that nearly made me… I think I did three or four counter-steers to control the car and I thought I was gonna crash in the middle of the straight. It just shows how on the limit Monaco is, with this kind of thing, especially on a race like this. You need maximum concentration, like Checo said, because any little mistake, any little off-line moment, you're in the wall, or you're on a damp patch and you you're off. No, thanks.",Monaco,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, I did the best I could, of course, after yesterday. Once you got blocked by with that red flag in qualifying you start fourth. I tried to do the best I can. I think as a team, we did a really good job with the strategy to basically get ahead of the Ferraris. And yeah, I think as a whole team we can be very pleased with the Sunday. I mean, it was a very hectic one with the rain and stuff, but I think we executed it well and I extended my points lead which I didn't expect last night so I think that's a positive Yeah, especially when it's wet and you haven't really driven around here in the wet and the types of course are very slippery. I think, yeah, it's all about just trying to be very focused. It’s easy to make a mistake of course. But, yeah, luckily nothing really crazy happened apart from Mick of course. but I heard he’s OK. So yeah, overall quite a decent day. Yeah, no, an amazing result for Checo, so very happy for him. Well, if you just look at single lap pace, I think they were they were faster than us. Long run around here is very difficult to say because nobody really pushes, of course, even in practice in the long runs, because it doesn't really matter. It's all about qualifying. And it doesn't really matter if you're fast in the race, because you can't pass anyway. So difficult to tell. But yeah, today was really about strategy and making the right calls. And I have to say the team was very relaxed and on it with their calls. Like very straightforward. There was no doubt:  it was like ‘pit now, we go on this tyre’; ‘pit now again we go on this tyre’. They did a really good job with that. Yeah, I needed it. I mean, otherwise he would have passed me because you would not have the traction. So, my pit exit was quite… probably that was the most fun I had in the race, just my pit exit, trying to stay ahead. Which summed up a bit my race. I mean, of course, after yesterday, not being able to do that final lap, you know you have to start fourth and you know, your race is going to be a bit compromised. But it's all about just trying to maximise the result and I think, as a team, we did that today. We had good pace. I mean, all the laps I had in clean air, they felt right. And then the call to go with the Medium at the end was quite risky, I think, compared to just staying on a hard tyre. Especially also because I think we didn't really know how many laps were going to be left. But I saw that the two cars in front of me started to grain a bit. Checo has quite a lot of front graining and Carlos was struggling a bit with the rear. And yeah, from my side. I mean, it's just impossible to pass. But my balance felt all right, and I could actually be really close. If I wanted to, I could have bumped Carlos a few times in the hairpin. Maybe he would have liked it. It was so close. You were doing also at one point a different line, in the hairpin. So yeah, it was getting close at the end but even with getting close, the problem is always the acceleration out of the corner. Like you can be in the gearbox but you can never pass because they always gain two or three-tenths, and that's just enough, of course, to then defend or whatever –  drive in the middle of the track. Just because of course, I have a little bit better grip, and of course, because we already did a few laps on the Hard tyres, so they were a bit cold. But of course, at the end, it doesn't really matter, because it was going to be a rolling start. A standing start, of course, it might make a difference but anyway, it wouldn't have been fair, you know, if it would have been a standing start, just because of the difference in…  well the left side was still quite wet. And that's why it was a good call to do a rolling start. But then, yeah, when I saw my Mediums on the car, I thought ‘it's going to be quite a tricky one to the end.’ But luckily, my feeling, I had still decent tyres to the end. I mean, of course, they're not in the best shape, but they felt alright. But of course, when you're following closely, you start wearing them more as well. Where you went a bit off-line? Yeah, was that just before we had the VSC? I think what you did today might help. Just a little bit. I don’t think so, in terms of whether the relationship will change. We have a good… Yeah, absolutely. Why would that change? We work really well as a team. We always try to optimise the car and work for the team and we can accept when somebody does a good job or does a better job and I think that’s very important because that’s how you are respectful to each other and yeah, may the best man win at the end, right? We always, of course, trying to do the best we can on the track but we also respect each other a lot and try to score the most possible points every single weekend for the team. I’ve no desire to chase the triple crown, at least, not IndyCar. I appreciate what they do. It’s insane, these drivers… I have a lot of respect for what they achieve there but for me, especially not being in F1 for such a long time already and yeah, I don’t need to risk my life there and potentially injure myself, your legs, whatever or… it’s just not worth it anymore, let’s say like that. Maybe Le Mans. I do like endurance races, so I will probably do some, hopefully soon, but for me, it doesn’t really matter. I, of course, try to be good in F1, I try to be good in whatever I do, but that desire of the triple crown or whatever – not interested. And about Baku, yeah, last year was unlucky, simple as that. We had it all in control, it would have been a… I don’t know what happened. Probably ran out of talent! Yeah, it looked like all in control and also for the team it would have been amazing result and you know these kind of things actually might have cost us at the end also potential World Championship for the teams, right, so it was a very painful one, but that happens. That’s racing, it’s still a mechanical sport but you don’t really think about it. It’s different cars, different tyres and we go again. He's going to  build a squad, so he can go along and play football with them.",Monaco,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"It's a dream comes true. I mean, as a driver, you dream of winning here. After your home race I think there is no other more special weekend to win. So to do it and the way we did it, you know we just made it even harder for ourselves at the end. But it was just with the graining I had, to not make any mistake, to bring it home, but keeping Carlos behind wasn’t easy. I wanted to do another race! The graining was just clearing up, so I wanted to go back again on the car I was super excited. It’s a massive day for myself, for my country. Well, certainly very high up there, winning Monaco, it's a dream come true as a driver. When you come into Formula 1 and when you come to Monaco, when you drive it for the first time, you always dream about one day winning the race or racing here. So it's just incredible. And it's such a big day for myself. I was driving with Pedro Rodriguez’s helmet today, and I'm sure that there he will be super proud of what we have achieved in this sport. No, it was quite obvious at the time that the track was ready for slicks, especially with the wets already overheated, but it wasn’t clear for me if we could keep going and do like Carlos did, going straight into the slick. But I think in that phase we lost such… Well, you could see with Carlos that he lost so much race time that I was already behind him, but again, we managed to stay out, pushed when we needed to, to make that inter work. And I think it was just a great combination, you know, the team was telling me what to do, how to get the maximum out of today's result. And we managed to make it work. It sounds easy. But in these conditions, pushing but not making mistakes, and not putting a foot wrong is never easy to achieve in Monaco. Yeah, I felt they had the race under control pretty, pretty easy. I felt like I was not really pushing. And then all of a sudden, I started to have a lot of understeer into [Turns] 3 and 4, lap after lap, and I could see that Carlos just was next to me. And I was like, well…  I still had very good traction out of Turn 8, so I was still a bit comfortable with it. But going into Turn 10 I knew that it was very important to not make a mistake because if you cut the chicane then you have to be back to position. So Carlos was putting a lot of pressure. But then towards the end, I managed to clear up the graining a bit, and it was mainly Turn 3 and 4. And then once I managed to open a bit of a gap, I could do my normal line through 3, 4, 5, which already brought some lap time with it and we managed to bring it home a bit safer. Yeah, this is Formula 1. You go from one end to the other in in a matter of seconds. So today it's a day to enjoy. Don't think too much about what's ahead because today it's a massive day for me. I knew I could park my car and there is no room for anyone to go. Well, certainly, in terms of history of the sport, I'm a big fan of my sport. So, certainly knowing what it means to win a race like this. I mean, they're all very important, but certainly this is very special. And it goes very, very high in the list for my country. And yeah, I certainly feel like at the moment, I'm the only Mexican – or even Latin American – driver on the grid. So, it just shows how difficult it is for us – not saying that for European drivers, it's easy – but it just shows how difficult it is for us to make it into the sport and to have successful career in this sport. It is quite hard, but I have to say I'm extremely proud of it. Well, at that point, I think, like Max said, it was clear that we were doing a rolling start. So we thought that it was going to be a relative short, short race, but still there were plenty of laps. And I'm sure if we were to do the race again, we will have chosen a different tyre to do the race. I meant about the bottle of champagne. We'll find out. I hope. We are still going to be in love, right? Definitely. When I was on the inters I was like… I think we screwed up because the track was pretty dry and it felt like it was just a matter of laps before we needed to go onto the slicks. Yeah, at that time, still like, it was just the crossover between the inters that were a bit quicker but because of the warm-up of the slick tyres and it’s where we could make the difference to Carlos when he boxed for that tyre, we were able to have a very quick in-lap, we pushed really hard and yeah, the tyre was there and the track was dry for the slicks tyres. Saying that, it was quite difficult the first laps because, especially on the hard, the warm-up felt a bit tricky. You don’t put in a lot of energy in Monaco so… It’s a day just to bring it home. We cannot be happy because we could have done a mistake. I was chatting earlier to Max, the amount of times that even Carlos, he was so close into 15, to touch the barrier. I was so close, Max, so we all had big moments today when the race could have been over. …. Lost it on the main straight, right? Yeah, I have no interest to be honest. In endurance, I don't know if I'll do that one day. I don't think so. I think once I am done with F1, I need to look to go back and look after my kids. I already have three,. so yeah, I'll be quite busy. I think that's more for these two guys. Yeah, it was a very special moment to get my first victory with the team, and especially at the time that it was my start with them and it was just a bit difficult the start and that was great to get my first victory for Red Bull.",Monaco,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"It is very special. I’m so incredibly happy. It's been a very smooth weekend until now. I knew the pace was in the car, I just had to do the job, and it went perfectly. That last lap before the red flag was really, really good. But anyway, it didn't change anything for us. Yeah, and it was really, really on the limit. I had quite a bit of oversteer. I struggled to put the tires in the right window in the last sector because there was a bit of traffic, but at the end the rear was a bit loose, but still the lap time came and I was improving quite a bit. I think I was four tenths faster before I stopped, so it was a good lap. But to be honest, the car felt amazing and it's great to also have Carlos with me on the front row. I think dry is a bit more predictable. But whatever comes I think we are competitive so it will be fine. Well, the first lap was good, obviously. I waited for Q3 to start and push. And it was a really good lap. But the one that I'm particularly happy about was the second lap in Q3 that I didn't get to finish. Yeah, this one was really, really good. A bit everywhere. The first corner was quite a bit better. I got a snap… Basically, I got snaps everywhere but the lap time was coming really, really good. So yeah, I was surprised by how much pace there was, because the balance was really, really tricky on that lap, but yeah, it felt really good. I think it's both the track and the drivers, because of course I think especially Red Bull and ourselves, we've got a bit more margin compared to the others in Q1 and Q2, so we don't push as much as other drivers. And then for Q2 you push a bit more and then obviously for Q3 you put everything, so yeah, it's a combination of both. Good. It was good. I mean, we only did like three or four laps, but it looks good. So hopefully it will be the case tomorrow. There's a bit of a chance of rain too. But yeah, that's fine. We were strong in the rain in Imola, so whatever comes we'll try to make the best out of it and finally have a good result at home. Well, I don't think I've ever driven in the wet here. Not that I remember. So it's going to be tricky. I mean, city tracks are very tricky. Monaco is probably one of the most challenging tracks of the season and in the wet I'm sure that it's even tougher. But yeah, we are ready for it. And I think again, the last two years have been difficult for us in the wet but this year we seem to have finally a bit more than the right window to make it work in the wet, so we'll see but we'll be fine. Yeah, the track conditions changed quite a bit, but I think we followed the track evolution very, very well. And the balance was actually pretty good all the time. So yeah, we followed the track evolution nicely. And then for the traffic, obviously, in Monaco, it's always a very, very difficult, especially in in qualifying, but I always found myself with fast cars behind me when I was on the out laps and this is the worst situation you can find yourself in, because you obviously don't want to get a penalty for being in the middle, so I was just trying to make the best job possible, but in some places, it's very, very tricky, because you just have no place and you cannot push that much because the tyres are completely new, and you have no grip. So it was a very tricky situation I was in and I just wanted to make sure that the team understood that I didn't want to be in that position again, because I was scared of getting a penalty, just being in the middle. But at the end, we managed it well. And I was out of trouble. I wouldn't call it frustration but I definitely wanted to finish that lap. I was a bit a bit more than four-tenths quicker. So, it was a really, really good lap. And also, I think the onboard is pretty oversteery, so I think it's a nice onboard. But yeah, it was a great lap until then. But yeah, as Checo said, it happened to me last year, and it happens in Monaco. So it's like this. No frustration. It's a very tricky one here, because we get into the pits. I actually don't even know where the panel is, whether it's on the right or left but it's very far, far right or far left, and so you don't look in that direction. So actually, I didn’t see at all that I was called to the weighbridge. But luckily for me, the team saw the alarm and just told me to stop and they pushed me back. It wasn't great for being into the same sequence of the others after that, but again, we got out of this tricky situation. It was good. It was all about building up to this Q3 lap. I knew the pace was there. I think we were in the right place with the car. And yeah, 2021 wasn't in my head when I was doing qualifying. You just want to erase it. And obviously it was also quite a long time ago. So yeah, I wasn't thinking about it. And I just went all in as always in Q3 here. No. No, no, no. I mean, I don't believe in… I'm not superstitious at all. So, no. I mean, we've had a smooth weekend until now and we're starting in the best place possible for tomorrow's race. So hopefully, we have a clean race tomorrow. And we finally have a good result at home.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Pérez crashed in front of me. And I was in my flying lap. I saw that yellow flag just coming into Turn 8, and I had to hit the brakes and obviously try to avoid him the best I could. But it's a shame. Another year that red flag causes the end of our session that we cannot go for pole position, but it's typical Monaco. I think so, yeah. We had a really good pace on all days. I was just building it up for quali. We will never know, it's impossible to say but I was feeling good with a car today. Yeah, let's try and finish the job tomorrow. I think we are in a great position to score a great result for a team. The car has been amazing all weekend. So we'll go for it. I don't mind. Yeah, well first of all congrats to Charles and Ferrari for a one-two lockout here in Monaco. I think it’s great news for the team, first of all. Second, yeah it wasn't bad. I think it was coming along nicely with qualifying. Unfortunately, in Q3 run one we had the two Mercedes in the middle of my first lap that they were doing a build-up and I was in my push and yeah, I found one Mercedes in the middle of Sector 2, the other one in Sector 3. Anyway, it was a bit of a scrappy first run at the beginning of Q3, but then I was looking forward to that final showdown here in Monaco. That is where you give that extra bit, and to have a clean run, but again, every year in Monaco now seems to be a tradition that someone crashes in front of me or whatever and you cannot complete the lap that is normally the most exciting lap around Monaco. Anyway, it is how it is. We start P2. I think it's a great position to start and tomorrow anything can happen – the rain, whatever comes comes – and we're in a good position. Well, coming obviously from a blind corner that is Turn 7, you do Turn 7, you go full throttle, and as I was entering Turn 7 on my left hand side I see a yellow flag coming out. And immediately as I see a yellow flag, I realise that the car in front of me had crashed. You don't see where he has crashed, so you enter the corner without knowing where he's going to be. So I just hit the brakes. I tried to do the corner radius as tight as possible. And just as I was going to manage to avoid him, I hit the brake a bit harder and managed to clip his back with the back of the car. It would have been a pretty good save if I would have saved it, but because there was basically no time to save it, but it's what happens in Monaco. Yeah, it's true that this weekend, I felt more comfortable with the car. Maybe it's a feature of just, that I've always been good around Monaco and I've always been quick around here. So that's a factor for sure. And that the car setup is always very different in Monaco to what it is for the rest of the season. So, it might be track specific, it might not. What is true is that I've been better and more comfortable this weekend. This, I agree.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, all okay. There was a technical issue, apparently, because the g I got, was something like 20-g but it's quite a low-speed section and there are TecPros there. Just a shame what happened, because I think we had more pace than that – but we just couldn’t challenge, I think, the strategy with the tyre, especially that final set: it wasn't up to temperature, and it was just too peaky. I nearly lost it already into Turn 1. In hindsight, I think we didn't get it right today. Well, basically, I was, I think, quite close to my time, trying to make it up. Turn 8 has been a difficult one for me, throughout the qualifying section. So I was trying to anticipate and get quite early on throttle. But as soon as I touched the throttle, I could feel like the rear tyre was not gripping in. And I was playing with it a bit, until I lost it. And then it was quite… I was actually surprised that Carlos hit me at the time. And it was just a shame, what happened? And I feel sorry for Carlos, and for the rest of the guys. But, you know, this is Monaco. Yeah, certainly, it looked bad from the rear. And what made it worse was the hit we got from Carlos. So, we have quite a bit of damage. But we'll see. I think it should be okay for tomorrow. Yeah, we've been competitive all weekend. Since FP1, we've been always top three. We were fastest in FP3 but, as always, to get the pole, you have to maximise everything. And I felt that we could have done better. Especially on those out laps. You know, at the end, I was stuck with one of the Ferraris and on my final Q3 lap the tyres were too cold. But in general, I felt that they were a bit ahead this weekend, the Ferraris, but we'll see. We'll see tomorrow. It's a long race ahead. Obviously the starting position is very important here but yeah, overall it has been a competitive weekend.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"I'd love to say that but today was very tough. I gave it everything I could to hold Max off, he did an amazing job, and we are so proud to be standing here. The guys have worked so hard, so this is for everyone back in Brackley and Brixworth, thank you. I heard it was a lot to be honest, but when I had the Red Bulls in my mirrors all I was doing was my maximum to keep them behind and it was an enjoyable, good couple of laps and I’m just pleased to be able to bring it home in P3. A lot of points on the board for us. So yeah, well done to Max, he did a great job. Yeah it was very difficult in the last few laps. It was a survival race, when we knew we had the gap, and as I said, just proud to bring it home in P3 and thanks to all the fans here, they have been amazing all weekend, and the support… Formula 1, at the moment, is in an incredible place so it's great to be here at the moment. It feels great to be on the podium and I think it goes to show the hard work and effort that's gone on back at a factory, both in Brackley and Brixworth. We've always said that you got to be there at the end to pick up the pieces, and pick up points and especially on days like today it was incredibly tough out there for the cars, for the drivers. But I feel like we're making progress. And I think we, as a team, have turned a page. I feel like this is probably the start of our season now. Yeah, definitely. I feel like this was more genuine. I think we probably have probably halved the gap to those front runners, compared to the rest of the season. And I think we know there's probably more performance to find. It's been a season of problem solving, as opposed to trying to find more performance and bring more performance to the car. And I think we've now finally solved our issue. And we can now focus on bringing more performance. So yeah, we're six races behind but there's no reason why we can't claw this back. Yeah, it was enjoyable. I mean, it's… I think Max and I first raced each other back in 2011. So it was nice to have the opportunity to fight with him. And, you know, I'm here to win, I'm here to fight and I obviously wasn't going to make it easy. I felt bad for him, because he obviously had the DRS  issues and he was clearly the faster man today. But still, I think it was hard, fair racing. And that's what we would like to see, and expect, in Formula 1. No, it was definitely when I was battling with Max, I was managing tyres, the engine was overheating, then trying to go as fast as possible to keep them behind. You’re juggling so many things. And then in the last five, six laps, it was literally just bring it home, get it to the end of a race, because we were right on the limit throughout the whole race. But the team did a great job to not allow us to go over that limit and have to retire the car. Nobody enjoys these challenging races with really difficult temperatures but that can make a difference. And if you do a better job, you're there to see the rewards, so proud of everybody to bring this home. Yeah, I think it's important that we are allowing this hard, fair racing and the rule is to give a car’s width and that was what was done and I think there was still a wheel on the track from Max. But yeah, it's a little bit difficult at the moment. I think there's a lot of…  We've obviously got the new stewards in and it's very difficult for everybody, and trying to understand each other, what we feel like is required from the driver's side, and what they expect from us as well, and it will just need this open dialogue. But I wasn't even aware they were looking into it, to be honest, I thought it was hard and fair racing.",Spain,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean of course I went off. I suddenly had a lot of tailwind, so I just lost the rear, went off and then, of course, I was in the train and I tried to pass, but my DRS was not always working. So, yeah, that made it very tough but we managed, due to the strategy, to get ahead again and do our own race and eventually win the race. So, a difficult beginning but a good end. Yeah, I tried to stay focused. Of course, it’s not nice when stuff like that happens. And yet of course very happy to win and also very happy for Checo. It was a great result for the team. Yeah, I think so. I think the behaviour of the car was good on the soft but also on the medium. I think it was working out quite well. Yeah, it was more for because of my DRS you know, but yeah, at the end, we managed to get ahead. Yeah, a bit of a race with two halves, because the first 30 laps were very frustrating for me, after I went off in Turn 4 first of all, which really caught me by surprise, because I didn't feel like I was actually braking later or throwing more speed into the corner. But it was very gusty out there today. Like, one lap it felt all stable and then the next lap suddenly you could have more oversteer in places. So probably that caught me out, by surprise. So that was not ideal, of course. But then, of course, I dropped back behind George and Checo. Checo was so kind to let me by to try to attack George because I think already we were planning to do two different strategies as a team, at the time. But then as soon as I was attacking George, my DRS stopped working all the time on the main straight. So that was extremely painful. Like, sometimes it would open, like, almost halfway on the straight or not at all. So yeah, that made me stuck behind George for 20 laps solid. So it was a tough one. Didn't feel like it. I mean, there is, of course, gravel there. But I didn't feel like I damaged the car, because once I was back on the track, the car felt like normal. So I was lucky there, of course. No, because I mean, I'm pressing the button, but the system is not opening. So this is not working. So we really have to fix that. I was a bit frustrated at the time, because I couldn't get him because of the DRS issues. But the fight itself, I think was really cool. Also, I think that lap where I did go on the inside and then George went around the outside, but then I was on the outside of Turn 3 again, I think that was a really cool fight. Yeah, I look back at it and I'll smile now. At the time, of course, I was a little bit frustrated. But it was a really good and tough battle, I think. It's a bit too early to say about the full race. Of course tyre deg, because he did pull away from me a little bit at the time, but there were races also before where this has happened a bit. I mean, I'm not saying that I'm not looking at it, for sure they had a really strong weekend and we definitely need to improve. We need to be better over one-lap performance, especially. But I think we were so early on in the race that it was a bit difficult to tell how big the margin was exactly. Because I don't even know what lap I went off but it was very early on and then we never really had a reference anymore, right. We always have to improve, but for sure, after this weekend, it shows that with all the upgrades they brought I think they definitely took a step forward. So now it's up to us, of course to try and close that gap down again. There was not…  I mean, I could have shouted back on the radio something, but there is nothing you can do because I mean, I'm not stupid, once you get the light and the activation beep, then you press the paddle. If it doesn't open, there's clearly an issue. I've spammed it like 50 times at one point on the straight and it's just not opening, so there was clearly an issue. I mean, I tried all different kinds of things, stay off the kerb, on the kerb, open it a tiny bit later but it was just broken – or like malfunctioning. So yeah, we clearly have an issue there on this wing. I think maybe they were looking at the moving a bit, the weaving… ah, Turn 3, because of leaving one car width? Yeah, luckily nothing happened. I mean, there was a bit of grip on the outside, so I'm okay with it. I think it was hard racing. And of course, I went around the outside but I'm also in the blind spot of George, so I think he didn't even really notice where I was exactly, right? Well, for sure you knew that I was there, but it's always hard to fully give a car’s width there because it's a fast corner, you’re drifting wide. So if I was in George’s position, I would have probably done the same, so it's just how we are, I think. We had a lot of options to look at because it was very difficult to judge how the deg was going to be so we were just trying to be very flexible. And yeah, during the race, you make that decision, right? They put me early on, because of being stuck, having my DRS issue, I think we decided to be a little bit on a different, more aggressive strategy, because if I wouldn't have had that DRS issue, I could have cleared George earlier and I would have, let’s say, opened the gap again. And then you're in a different situation where maybe then we do a different strategy, right, but we had to improvise a bit because of that. And it worked out well because the tyres were very difficult.  Even in my last stint, like the last few laps. Of course, I had the margin in the back, but the tyres also they didn't feel let's say amazing anymore. Well, it's just things we can improve, right? That issue with the DRS, of course, was quite costly but at the end, we still won the race, so as a team we are quite flexible. We adapt quickly if we have issues and we try to work around it, even during the race, so that's good. But, yeah, of course, we tried to make sure that that doesn't happen again. But we didn't retire which other teams did. So that's already a good improvement and you can see, it completely swings the championship around again.  So from our side, yeah, we just have to try and be really consistent and try not to make too many mistakes. I mean, you're not a robot, I mean mistakes will happen. But yeah, we'll try to minimise it. It shouldn't be really car related because like the engines and stuff are pretty much the same. Of course, the fuel has changed a little bit, but it's a bit weird. Yeah. also from our side, of course, we had already two retirements where before we were always really strong on reliability, so it's a bit difficult to tell. It's also not major issues that we had. I don't know, of course, about Ferrari, but from our side it’s little things and yeah, we are trying to be on top of that, but I don't think it's specifically car related.",Spain,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, definitely. I mean, you already have very two good drivers but I’ve been feeling a lot of support this weekend, so I'm extremely happy to be on the podium for the first time in the Spanish Grand Prix. Yes, I think it was close. But at the end it is a great team result and I'm happy for that. Yeah, we were on different tyre strategies at the time. I let Max by in the beginning, then I thought at the time that I could I could go by and not lose crucial seconds, you know, to make my strategy work, but anyway, it's a good team result. Yeah, it was great. My first podium here in Spain. They obviously have their two very good drivers, Spanish drivers, but I can say that I'm probably the third one in terms of support here because every year it's been amazing. And to be on the podium for the first time, it’s nice, and great team result as well. We took our opportunities and very pleased with that. Well, on the first stint, when I let Max by, I was told that I was going to get it back. And we knew we were on different strategies. So when I was back on it, I felt like I could have gone through and probably given a better shot at my strategy, to make it work. But at the end of the day, it turned out to be the three-stop the way to go today. Not very unpredictable. I think we kind of expected it to be this bad. So, it was not a surprise today. Well, I think today… I think what was clear was that the three-stop was a better race, race time, and the various strategies, so I think if I went in that direction, I would have won the race. And it worked out for Max. I think that was something we discussed. It was good, because we didn't know at the time which strategy was going to be the best one. I only felt that in the first stint when I gave the position to Max, that I was told that I was going to get it back and when I was on the two-stop I felt that I could have gone through Max and George a bit earlier to try and make the strategy work, but probably it wouldn't have been enough. But it still is a great team result, the season is still very young and, yeah, I think the momentum in the team is great. So we just have to discuss a few things internally. But yeah, there's nothing that I'm concerned of. If anything, I can say that the atmosphere in the team, the momentum we're carrying, it is tremendous, like no other team, so I'm pleased with that.",Spain,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was really tough, but a good race. I mean, we were battling hard at the front and yeah, we just tried to play the long game. They were really quick through corners, we were quick on the straight. But the tyres were wearing out quite quick around here. You could see at the end, I think we had a little bit more pace, so I just tried to get by. It wasn't easy, playing smart tricks in the last corner, but eventually I managed to get ahead. But even after that he was constantly in the DRS and then with the yellow flags in the last lap, just knowing how much you should lift, whether it was allowed or not. It was tough but I’m really happy that we finally kickstarted the season. Yeah, it seems like once you get quite close, because I think the cars, when you get to within half a second, you actually can have a good exit. And I think that makes a lot more tricky to actually do the pass, let's say in the last corner compared to last year, so it's a lot harder to plan your pass. Qualifying laps! It was tough. I didn't really feel that happy on the medium. All the time, when you would get close to the car ahead the tyres would die. So there was not much racing going on there. So it was a little bit frustrating to just sit there and wait for the right lap to pit so you could go onto the other tyres, because as soon as we went on to the hard tyre I had a much better feeling. So then I of course tried to stay close with Charles after the safety car restart and, yeah, I was just trying to keep the gap more or less the same. And that was basically it, you know, just trying to match the lap times, trying to get a bit closer, then he was pulling away a bit. I got a bit closer again. And yeah, then of course, we had the VSC at the end. And then it's always a bit of a question mark, you know, what's going to happen after with the tyres, of course, because they cooled down a lot, but it seemed like we had quite a good first few laps on that restart. I had a good feeling with the car and the tyres were still only holding on quite well through the high speed. And of course, I then had a few good opportunities, but Charles really played it smart in the last corner. So it was not easy for me to actually get by. And of course then I had to line myself up again to have another go at it. And eventually I had the go and I got ahead but then once I was ahead it was really like four laps flat out trying to stay ahead because Charles was consistently in my DRS. So yeah, it was quite tough out there. Well, in go-karting you can rub a bit, you know, with the sidepods and stuff. That's unfortunately not possible anymore in Formula cars. But we have done that in the past. I think we are okay. Difficult to say if it's a step forward, but I think we are always learning and of course every track is different as well, in terms of what you need from the car, so still a lot of things to look at. Because clearly yesterday I wasn't very happy and also in the first stint it still wasn't how I would have liked it to be. But having said that, I think in general, being the car following you just open up your tyre a bit sooner and it's not great out there. Because as soon as I felt like I was in clean air, the car actually did change a bit in balance. So yeah, we'll have a look but still quite a few things of course to get on top of because it's a very new car still. To be honest, I was a little bit surprised myself that it did look a little bit closer, but I don't know how close Charles was, of course to zero, you know, with the delta. That's always a bit of a question mark. But also, sometimes it depends a bit where the restart is: if it's in a corner for somebody in front or not. I think I was still on a bit more of the straight side and had a bit of a better run into Turn Four as well. So, it's a bit tricky. And yeah, I think, like Charles said, you know, you always try to of course have a good run with the DRS into the final zone, where then you have a lot of fast corners where you cannot pass so, of course you know Charles played is very smart there, but also, it seemed like their defence/attack mode is very powerful. So, for me also, even more top speed. It was very hard to nail the overtake, but eventually it worked. I think the cars are better to follow, it just depends on the tyre. Like the hard tyre was capable of following closer, the other compounds – and this depends on the track – but they just fall apart. Like, as soon as you follow for a few laps, they just open up. And I think it's also a little bit of a thing … probably tyres, but also the weight of the car pushes you over the tyre edge. So, this is something we need to look at for the future. Because yeah, we improved the following with the cars, and I think probably the racing, but if the tyres don't let you, due to whatever reason, if it's the weight of the actual car, that’s a bit of a shame, because in the first stint, I think we could have actually raced a bit more if the tyre didn't die. Because everyone was basically struggling with the same thing at one point. So yeah, we need to understand that a bit better. Well, if I didn't have DRS today I would have never passed. I think we are still too sensitive for that. And of course, some tracks are easier to pass than others. But for me at the moment, if DRS wouldn't be there, I would have been second today. Every battle is different but yeah, well, it's just smart racing and good racing, you know, so just have to deal with it, adjust to it. And yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was not easy but a lot of fun. Yeah, that middle bit. I was just trying to stay with Charles without hurting the tyres too much because that was a bit my problem in the first stint, to see what would happen in the last 10 laps or 15 laps. And yeah, then of course, that VSC happens so the tyres also cooled down quite a bit. But then yeah, when I started to fully push, seemed like we had good pace. So that's why I think I could actually push up to Charles a little bit. So yeah, a lot happier on the hard tyre in general with degradation. And about the race here, well, we had a lot of guarantees that of course, we would be safe but I think after this weekend, all the drivers also together, we will speak with F1 and of course also the team bosses to see what's happening for the future.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it was, but it wasn't enough today. But oh my god, I really enjoyed that race. Again, it's hard racing, but fair. And every race should be like this. So it was fun. I'm of course disappointed. I wanted to win today. We just missed. I mean, we had two very different configurations with Max and Checo and both the Ferraris. We were quite quick in the corners, but quite slow in the straight, because we put more downforce and so it was extremely difficult for me to cover Max in the straights, but it's like this, and he did a great job and it was a fun race. Oh, yeah. It's always been there, especially when you finish a race like this, honestly. I mean, we are on a street track, we've been pushing like I've rarely pushed before, to the absolute limits and we take risks at the end. So of course there is respect, but I’m a bit disappointed. I definitely enjoyed the fight. It's obviously disappointing to lose the win so late in the race but it was a fun fight. It was very difficult because we had two cars that were in a very different place. I was very strong in the first sector, in all the corners, and basically much less strong in the straights. So it was very, very tricky. I tried to have the DRS in the last corner. It worked twice but it didn't the last time and then obviously there was this yellow flag. I don't know if we are speaking about the same yellow flag but I think the one where I could have had a chance to at least be alongside was the one into Turn 1 where I had no DRS there, so this was a little bit of a shame but it's part of the game! We'll try again next race. They were consistent, but the first run was a bit more difficult. I think we did a great job by managing those Mediums, because it wasn’t easy following Checo. But, towards the end we actually had quite a good pace on those Mediums. And then on the Hard, it felt nice whenever I had a little bit of margin I felt like I could keep the gap to Max but then obviously with the Safety Cars with the Virtual Safety Cars as soon as he got within DRS range, everything became a bit trickier there. But yeah, it's like this. No, no. We were ready to pit. I mean, yes we basically went for the opposite to Checo in front, and he boxed that lap, so yeah, I think we did the right choice. For the VSC I mean, I don't know. This is probably more a question for Max. And I'm pretty sure that if there is a way, he won't say it now, in front of everyone. But yeah, I felt at one point that Max was closer, but actually, I think at the actual restart, I don't think it was the case. But we'll look into it anyway. And yeah, I knew that the strength of Max and the Red Bull in general, this weekend was the straight line speed. So I basically knew that if I was leaving Max with a DRS behind for the main straight, I will basically be overtaken very easily. So, I just wanted that, DRS, so on the first lap, I braked very early and I got the DRS and manage to overtake back on the run to Turn One. And then the second one, obviously Max knew that I was going to do that, so we both braked quite early, but I still managed to stay in front at the end. And the third time, it didn't work out for me. But yeah, I just tried to do the best I could to keep the position but it wasn't enough today. Yeah, very similar, very similar comments. But it is definitely a step forward compared to last year in terms of following. The balance of the car is much more predictable, compared to last year's car where it was very difficult to understand whether you will lose the front, or the rear being behind. This helps us to have the confidence, to actually push behind someone and to be a bit closer. So, it is a step forward but, as Max said, I think there are other things that we can probably look out for the future to make it even better. Yeah, I think we still need DRS for now. Yeah so for the tyre management, I don't think we did anything wrong, there. Yeah, I don't think it is the reason why we lost a win today. I forgot what I wanted to say. Alright, go ahead. Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah. I'm back. So yeah, I think the point where we struggled the most is whenever Max got the DRS basically, because our weaknesses were just bigger, the straight-line speed difference was much bigger. We were still quick in the corners, but not enough to have that margin to cover. So from that moment onwards, it was a bit more difficult for us.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah it was close call there with Checo but in the end I think he got a bit unlucky with a safety car obviously but the rules are the rules and I think I was just ahead at the safety car line and it was my position then, and since then it was all about holding on to P3. The Red Bulls were super quick in the last 10 laps after the tyres cooled down on the safety car, on the virtual. They were flying and they were putting pressure on us. For me this race was a bit of progress from Bahrain. I think I managed to find a bit more rhythm with the car. Still some tenths to find but I think I will end up getting there. I was happier than in Bahrain, definitely. There's been a bit of progress done from my side of the garage, with the feeling with the car. Also, having the opportunity to come to this track, one hundred days only after we were here with last year's car has given me a much clearer picture of the type of corner and the two or three corners that I'm still lacking with this car – because it’s quite clear for me now, it has given me a great opportunity to understand fully the magnitude of how much I need to adapt and how much I need to get the car bit more to my liking. I felt like today we did a small step in the right direction and you know still… well, while I'm still not 100 per cent with the car, to keep bringing the points and the podiums is important, until I will get back to 100 per cent and it will be time to join these guys at the top for the fights. Yeah, it's a very narrow start here. So I had a very good launch out of the start. And then I was squeezed a bit in between Checo and Charles, and I had to lift and this gave Max the opportunity to go on the inside, and pass me outside of Two with a better run. I was just basically a bit unlucky because I think I was just boxed in, due to my good start and I had to lift. So yeah, the good thing is that it was a good start and they’re going to be important for this year. Those good starts. And we need to keep them up. I agree, I think without DRS passing would be reduced significantly. So I think we are still better off with DRS. What we might need to consider maybe is the speed delta that there is with the DRS might be a bit too much, which gives the car behind maybe too much of a speed delta [so] that sometimes the overtake is done before the braking. And you’d much rather have the two cars battling under braking rather than passing like in the highway. Now, that is sometimes what can happen. So maybe we need to have a look at this but we definitely need DRS nowadays. Well, the fact is that as you say you I'm not feeling 100% but I felt like this weekend we already  did a step in the right direction and this gives me hope that if we keep working like this then I should just keep getting better and better every race. It might need a bit of more trial and error, try in one direction, maybe not getting it right and coming back. But yeah, as I said before, I was here 100 days ago with a car that gave me a lot of confidence and I was super quick around here with last year’s car, and coming to this track and doing the same lap 100 days later with a car that doesn't give me exactly what I need or, or the way I feel, makes me realise exactly what I need to work on and where I need to put the car for the future. So it's going to be  a… it has given me a greater overview of the situation, and I know exactly what to do for future races and in which type of corner I need to work on. I am not sure if I'm allowed to go into detail about the problem. I think it's better you ask the team exactly what happened. What I know is that there was a bit of tension there because we were obviously about to go to the grid and the mechanics and everyone just did a great job to put everything back together to have the chance to race today. So a big thank-you to them. These things happen and it was important, you know, to get out there to score the points today. So good job. It definitely was very strange. I think as a sport we need to keep analysing these things because we could simplify things so much more if Checo would have just given me the position during the safety car which basically would have given me an opportunity to fight Max at the restart and would have given Checo on opportunity to fight me to get the position but what happened is that I was obviously fighting Checo, but I knew that Checo was going to give me a position quickly and he couldn't fight me because he was going to give me a position back so in the end, we created a mess that for me is unnecessary, given the fact that we did six laps behind the safety car and there were",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Ferrari
Valtteri Bottas,"[mic dropout] … starting the season more or less on the right path, and that we have potential with the car. We have potential in the team, within the people. So yeah, it gives me a lot of courage and hope for the for the season ahead. So, yeah, really pleased with the end result at the end. During the practice sessions last weekend, we saw that if we can get everything right, we should be able to fight for top 10. Actually, qualifying sixth was a bit of a positive surprise. In the race… it was not an easy start the race but then afterwards, what we achieved, obviously, with some bad luck from competitors, with the points that we had. Yeah, I think it was slightly beyond expectation, but it's a positive surprise. I've been very happy with my Ferrari engine. It's been good to drive but honestly, they’ve made great progress from last year and we still keep working hard trying to optimise everything and hopefully there's eventually more to come but I think overall in a good place. I think it's been one of the biggest priorities since the first race. And we saw already in testing, there's unfortunately, the no quick fix. I think the lead time is going to be – I don't know – maybe another one or two races, at least for a mechanical fix as such. But there's other things we are trying to try to look into, how we can avoid it, because like I said, like 50% of the starts, it happens. But how do we avoid it, you know, in terms of hold the revs, where you drop the clutch, or the driver inputs, trying to be as consistent as possible. So, we're working in all those areas to try and hopefully have clean starts for both cars and more consistent ones. So, that's where we're at at the moment, and we're working on it. I think the fact is that as drivers, it almost feels like we didn't really have a choice where we race. If we could choose places, maybe we would change the calendar a bit. But we love what we do and I love racing, and we're here to get points. I think we end up going to places and trusting Formula 1, that it is appropriate. And, of course, Formula 1, the big thing is to try to raise the issues, and bring the awareness and go to places and try and do something positive than negative. Already, from last year, I can see a bit of a change in the country. And I've met a couple of local people. And you know, they're all really hyped about Formula 1, so I think it creates positive things in a way. But for the things that is going on behind the scenes, I'm not fully aware of all of those. So yeah, I don't really want to say too much, I just hope that we have positive impact. That's what I'm…  I really hope so. Yeah. And I race, wherever if that means I can get points because I'm a driver.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Alfa Romeo
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, a few things are just trying to sort out. We have some ideas coming into this weekend, so look forward to see what we can do. Yeah, we had a better day on Sunday. But, you know, I still think we have some work to do to catch up to some teams in front of us and you know, really be in a position to fight for some points. Like I said, it's a few things. We're on top of it. Let's see what we can do to try and sort some of those things out this week. Yeah, it's been fun. You know, he's a nice guy, obviously. You know, feeling for Seb, I think he's been feeling pretty rough, so I wish him all the best and a speedy recovery. Yeah, I think we’ll understand a lot more this weekend. Just nature of this circuit. Yeah, we’ll have a much better idea.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Aston Martin
George Russell,"I think it was probably as we expected, obviously so many people thought we were sandbagging during testing and that would just turn up to race one and turn it up and be fighting for victories. But I think we all knew what our limitations were. Ultimately, we came away with a good result as a team. Probably not on merit with the pace of the car, but we say you gotta be in it to win it. So we'll definitely take that result and keep on working, keep on pushing and see what we can achieve this weekend. I think there's always more to come, to be honest. I think the pace was fine, nothing spectacular. Generally looking fine in qualifying until Q3, made a bit of mistake from my side. But I think… for me personally, it feels at the moment in a similar position to what I found myself in the previous years that our competitors ahead of us are so far in front and we do have a bit of a buffer behind so can almost afford to take a few more risks to try to make up that gap. And you know, for me, I qualified ninth and we had the pace to be able to come back through the field and you know, back up to P5, P6, so we're in a bit of an intriguing spot right now, that we can try a few things, But I think ultimately, there's more to come from all of us: myself; Lewis; the whole team, and we just need to keep on working. I think there's always room to improve. But I think the Williams with a Mercedes power unit in the back was the fastest car on the straights, I believe, in Bahrain, or one of the fastest cars on the straights. So, I think there's, there's a number of reasons why we were we were struggling. I think we had more wing on compared to the Red Bull and the Ferrari, I think the porpoising issues aren't helping things either, because we're just crashing into the floor, as opposed to skating along the top of a surface. So, we'll have to wait and see, but I don't think it's necessarily purely down to the power unit. I think in Formula 1, things change incredibly quickly. We are very fortunate that the calendar is not, as I said before, it's not very dense at the start of this season. And even if it's a couple of months, we are only six or seven races down and out of a 23 race season. And even if you come out the blocks incredibly fast after the summer break, even as Mercedes and Lewis did last year, you're still in with a shot. So, we need to be in almost damage limitation mode at the moment, pick up the pieces, when there's an opportunity, don't throw away unnecessary points, even though it may just be for fifth or sixth or hopefully, a bit higher, and make sure we were within touching distance always. And then hopefully, when the car does improve, we can come back fighting. It's a very long season, I think we've all got confidence that if we do things right, there's no reason why we can't close the gap and potentially overtake – but we equally appreciate and recognise that Ferrari and Red Bull will continuously improve as well. So, we could close up by six-tenths; there’s no reason  why they can't extend by another six-tenths as well. So we need to play it by ear. We'll have to test that and see, and we'll only get the feedback once we go out there. Sometimes solutions like this work really well; sometimes not so well. We know the difficulties of visibility on a circuit like this. And I think the more the FIA can do to help us is only going to be beneficial. So, I can't comment quite at this moment but it could be quite an intriguing implementation and if it works we’ll  potentially see it in Baku, Monaco, Singapore maybe and it reduces the danger, risk and improves safety for all of us, then why not? I think it's clearly concerning to see what is going on in some of these places but I do hope that racing in some of these countries, it does raise awareness, and we can have a positive impact. And I think if Formula One can look back in 15, 20, 30, 40 years’ time, and see that the impact of our sport has had a positive change on society in some of these countries we're going to, that's something we should all be incredibly proud about. So, I think you can't ignore these facts. I just hope that with our platform, we are raising the right awareness and we can have a positive change in the long run. We have to wait and see. I mean, some teams are experiencing more issues with the porpoising than others. For us last week in Bahrain, it was definitely not pleasant down the straights. The difference here is, there are no straights. The straights are bends and if we experience that, that may be quite… we could find ourselves in a dangerous situation. But we have to wait and see. I can't look into the future. For sure, with these bigger wheels and with the wheel arches, our visibility has reduced, it will be our first street circuit and I think it will be intriguing to hear from all the drivers to see how we get on with the visibility. Some corners are worse than others. It's generally the tighter corners where the bigger wheels are having a negative impact for the visibility. It may not be such an issue here but perhaps when we go to Monaco, Singapore, it will be. So, we have to we have to wait and see.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Mercedes
Alex Albon,"Thank you! Yeah, I feel like actually, if you look at where we were during testing, especially during the Bahrain testing, we were a little bit on the backfoot. And to get… we got P13 I believe in the end, obviously, a few DNFs, but a little bit like George said, actually, for us, it was kind of the same story. We optimised what we had and I felt like, as a team, we did a great job to get the most out of the car. And we did a good job over the weekend. I feel that we've got a good platform to work with. We know the weaknesses of the car and focus on addressing them. I think there's definitely going to be some circuits that suit us more than others. And obviously, it's trying to make those circuits… well, trying to be competitive in all styles and really get rid of the weaknesses. So, Bahrain was, we believe, was one of our weaker circuits. So, if we can fix that and address those issues, I think we'll be we'll be in a good place. Yeah, it is. And I don't want to speak too soon in case, in case it's not there but I think, hopefully, we'll see how it goes, and we'll be fighting a bit more towards the mid-pack. I think what George said applies to us as well. I mean, we've got to focus on ourselves first and foremost, I think that's really the main priority. We're clearly behind but also we're behind in the corners as well. We'll see where it comes out during the season but for now, at least, we just need to look close by and see what we can do better.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Williams
Lando Norris,"Downforce. Just overall grip. It’s quite a simple thing. Like there's quite a few times when the balance has been in a decent place. And if the balance is in a decent place, but you just slow then it's quite a simple thing of what you need. So there's not loads of problems, it’s just one, I guess, one big problem, which is very costly in the world of Formula 1, because all you need is downforce and that's what we're struggling with a minute. So that’s what we need to work on. There is, there is. It's not a not an easy thing to say exactly when, or the timescale or anything. but I have good faith that we've not come out strong and we've struggled a little bit, definitely, in the first race but there’s hope and there's a good team back in MTC already working on a on a good plan to f put things back together. And I guess just try and understand everything on where it's gone wrong and what we've missed, and so on. And as soon as we figure that out, then then there is. James [Key, technical director] is working hard already and was already as soon as we f realised where we were standing compared to other teams, putting that plan in place of recovering and trying to get back to much higher positions. Yeah. II mean, it's, it's weird because we started off in… it's not weird it’s just what confused us a little bit initially is the fact that we were a little bit stronger in Barcelona. And I think we just started off with a, I’d say, a decent car. We just didn't make a lot of progress, because it was a car which just went on to the track very well. And we understood how to optimise the car very quickly. But then we can make much further progress from there. And I think that's where all the other teams were able to take steps forward, continuing to find out about the car and make bigger steps. There was more hope after Barcelona but that slowly went away with time, when everyone else was able to find out more about the car and bring bigger upgrades and we could, then we took some steps back. We’ve not struggled with porpoising, so I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing. In some ways, there’s advantages to having it in a way. And there's some disadvantages. So, it's not necessarily always a bad thing about having it. Some parts of having it mean, certain things are working well. So if that's the reason we don't have it, then that's obviously the bad thing. But we're also not struggling with the issue so we can optimise other areas of the car and gain in other areas, but we're just not getting anywhere near enough, the amount that we that we need. So no, I think there's good things. And I'm hoping that there will be certain tracks, more in line with Barcelona-esque, which is going to favour us a little bit more. I do think but Bahrain was on the tougher side and track, which was more towards the slower speed and so on. In the medium speed corners, we didn't struggle quite as much. So, I'm hoping this weekend can be slightly better. But I don't be too over-optimistic and say we're gonna have a great weekend when it could be pretty similar to last one. George and Mercedes are our main guys to compare to from a Mercedes point of view, and they're a long way down the road from us. So, before we would ever start to complain about engine or anything, we need a much better car first. You can't lie. There's always… if you have points and you have success and you have podiums, there's always a rise in morale. So, I don't think it’s got worse, I think there’s expectations, of course, and we want to… as just racing people…  we want to have success and do well. We're never going to be as happy P16. compared to if we were P8 or P7 or whatever. So, there's always just a little bit of our happiness gone. But at the same time, I think the key thing is everyone's still very motivated. Like George said, there's still such a long season to go. And, and even if it is two months of struggling, or six, seven, eight races of struggling, I think everyone's quite confident and just motivated within themselves and with other people, that we can make good progress again, and get back to where we should be. So yeah, I don't think we can be happy with where we are. I think that's the point of what I'm trying to say: we can't be happy, and therefore we're not but the important thing is we're all motivated still to get back to where we know we should be. Yeah, George said it well. I think we have to kind of just wait and see. It's such a quick section – it isn’t like you have a lot of time to look at a TV screen and see what's going on. But we'll see, and if it is good then I'm sure we're trying to implement it more through the rest of the season. No, it's not the issue. We just need to go around the corners quicker. We don't need to try and brake any later at the minute. We'll be able to brake later when we have more downforce is just as simple as that, really. So, there are some changes, some different fuel changes and so on, but it's got nothing to do with our pace loss and where we're struggling at the minute.",Saudi Arabia,friday,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Hi, everyone. It’s good to see everybody. Well, a huge amount of work has gone on in the past three days. I’m very proud of my team for just keeping their heads down, staying focused, churning through the crazy amounts of data that there is, every time we're basically out in the car, and just trying to understand what are the issues we have. We were aware of the problems we have, but in terms of what's causing it, we're just working through trying to figure that out and how we can rectify it without losing performance and ultimately gaining performance. But three days doesn't… there is such a short time between races there's not a huge difference here this weekend. But hopefully, we'll have some things to try. And from a driver's perspective that that's exciting when you go to come to today when we get in the car for example, just trying something new and hoping that it unlocks a bit of performance. But those are the others are still very strong. And as I said last week, it was great to see Ferrari back up there after a couple of difficult years. It is different, so yeah, it shouldn't be as bumpy as Bahrain obviously. Bahrain is a much older circuit, it’s got more character to it, because it is as old as it is. This track is super fast and but a different surface will behave with the tyres differently. These long, long straights where we might not be too fun with the bouncing if we still have it. But yeah, everyone's… well, those that have the bouncing are in the same boat. And hopefully, we'll try and fix some of it. Yeah, I pretty much am nocturnal, yeah. I don't think so. I think we probably all do the same. You don't really notice a huge difference from day to night, it's just temperature and track surface difference is probably the only thing. The night races are awesome. And naturally, when the track cools, it makes it a little bit easier for us to do what we do in terms of making these tyres, that struggle to last on the hotter surfaces, last. Hotter tracks are difficult. But no, not really. I think I’ve just probably been fortunate that we've hit the sweet spot on most of the night races. Yes, I did see it. And I was really fortunate actually just during the process to be speaking to Serena and Venus about the whole process and how excited they were about the documentary. And of course, I know Will [Smith], so really proud of what he was able to project with this film. I know he's had awards and stuff, but I was really moved by the story, I think ultimately, because I think we all of us have watched both of them rise and see their success and trials and tribulations. But like all of us [we] very much don't always understand what it's taken to get there. People that tune in probably just think that they're just the best and [they are] not understanding the commitment and the time and sacrifice that they have to put in. And so it's amazing that Will was able to highlight that. Behind everyone that's successful there is always somebody and I can relate to it because I have a very amazing family who, without them, I would not be here today. And I hope at some stage, I'll be able to do something similar, to be able to… I think it's inspiring for families out there who… I'm sure anyone in here that has kids wants the best for their kids and wants to create the best opportunity and push them in the right way, but not too much. And I think that was a great showing of how you can do that. Yeah, It is. I don't know if everyone here has the bouncing. But it's something that when I've sat down and spoken to the aerodynamicists and engineers that we've not faced before. So it's new for everyone. I think it's exciting when there's something new, but when it continues and continues and you can't figure out how to fix it of course, that's not always the best. But we will get to the bottom of it. And I think some people been able to fix the bouncing that they have. Of course, we have this downforce and we have these bumpy circuits, so there has always has been a form of bouncing, but nowhere near to this kind of level. So we're just trying to learn as fast as we can in the short space of time that we have between races. I don't know what to say, really. My position is still the same as I spoke on last year. There's not really a lot that I can say that's going to make any difference. It's obviously mind-blowing to hear the stories. I've heard that there's a letter been sent to me, for example, from a 14-year-old who is on death row. When you're 14, you don't know what the hell you're doing in life. But we don't decide where we go. And, as Daniel says, I think we do have an opportunity to try… I think we're duty bound to try and do what we can while we're here… It's not necessarily our responsibility, us up here that are brought here, but we try and do what we can. And I think it's important that we just try to educate ourselves. And with the little bit of difference that we can try to make, make sure we are doing something. But ultimately it's the responsibility those of those that are in power to really make the changes. And we're not really seeing enough. So we need to see more. Well, I didn't feel downbeat. I was being realistic that we have issues and we’re fighting to fix them. I think there's a lot of potential in our car and we're just trying to work as hard as we can to rectify them as quick as possible. And we've seen the amazing performance of some of the other teams, how close it is between all of us. And so I am hopeful that week on week we will improve. I have no doubt that I've got the best group of people behind me in order to come up with solutions and fix it and extract performance. So I don't currently feel too stressed. But I want to get in the fight as soon as possible. But the last race was an amazing feeling for us. Given where we thought we were going to be, to come out with the result we did. But we can't rely every weekend on that to happen. So we need to move forward as fast as we can. I think again, just reflecting on that, it shouldn't be our responsibility to have to do that. But it is obviously a very, very complex situation. But I'm always open to having a discussion, to learning more, to try to understand exactly why the things that are happening are happening and why they're not changing at all. Because, look, it's 2022 and it's easy to make changes. So, but I'm open to doing that. I don't know who I'd have to speak to exactly. But I'd love to see that. I know that Boris has been over here recently. I heard that human rights were raised during that, but what was said, what’s being done, I’ve heard about that? I didn't know that. That's pretty amazing. I'm grateful for Mercedes’ loyalty to me over the over the years, you know, but I've been with Mercedes since I was 13. So, it’s a long stretch together and I'm very much embedded in the family. And I'm grateful to be a part of that history ansd continuing to work on adding to that in the future. I've not been given exact numbers, but I know they're large. But I think it's the same for everyone. You know, those that have had to raise their car, it's much steeper steps that we've seen compared to previous years. And there's lots of performance when you can reduce some of those steps, obviously, lowering the car, for example. The cars that were ahead of us, for example, have an incredible amount of low-speed downforce. So I don't know what the exact number is, but I know it's, it's nothing. It's not small. I have no idea who would who would have played me. But as I mentioned the last time I was here, we have this documentary that we're working on and I think you have to just do everything at the right time. The documentary is the current focus. I think stories are there to be told. I think it's important. I think there's lots that can be learned. And as I mentioned, for people, if you can affect and have a positive impact, if your story can have one positive impact even on one person or one family that's could be amazing. So I think, yeah, one day I perhaps will try to do the same maybe. Very inspired by how Will did it with his team. And with those two icons, pretty proud of them. So yeah, maybe one day. I don't know. I have no idea who I get to play me. I don't know who's out there that that are that I would use at the moment. I'd have to do some research. But I'm actually going through a process right now of castings for another project that I have. And that's quite an interesting process to go through. So it's quite exciting, reading up on all these different characters, people that could fit a role that the script… you know, when the script’s written, and they’re writing that character, finding someone that matches that and  represents that character is quite an interesting process.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Mercedes
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, it was very good and I was more like very satisfied with the result, just because there's a huge relief from the pressures I was having since last year, as I mentioned before in few interviews. But yeah, overall, I think with the debut, our first weekend, I was able to have no mistakes inside the cockpit, which was very good, and then that was able to give me that confidence try to improve session by session. And of course there's plenty of stuff for me to be still looking at and to improve from myself, but nevertheless, I think especially for the race it was a very good comeback after a difficult start of the opening lap. And then, yeah, I think the team did a very good job to, you know, make a big step of improvements in the car compared to where we were the year before, so that really gives us the boost to be keep working and yeah, it's still a long season to go but it was a very good starting point and then all the team are very happy with you know, we was able to give them the reward or this hard work during the winter so that was very nice. It definitely gave me confidence or more like a belief with the car, how much I was able to push, probably more into the limit of the car, but nevertheless I think that was what was missing in qualifying because I think both cars had maybe the ability to be going into Q3 but to be already in Q2 I think was a good first step. But here Saudi is a complete different layout of the circuit, a lot of high speed, a lot of straights and we have to probably be more realistic [about] where we are compared to the others because it could be you know, In Bahrain we were good, could be here we are even better or we struggle more, so we have to find out. But nevertheless it was nice to be able to trust the car more, since day one in Barcelona to Bahrain qualifying I have much more built up the confidence with the car. Well, for us, how we started at the very beginning, first day, put the new car on track compared to now is of course a big improvement. I think it’s the same for the other teams out there. But nevertheless, I think we normally suffer more when the DRS is not open on the straights when the bouncing to be a bit more unnatural for me. But in a way I'm quite used to it because when I drove F2 we normally were suffering very harsh, stiff, bouncing or with the kerb riding. So I'm used to that. But definitely having bouncing [at] high speed is not something nice to have. But I think we can have probably if going to Monaco, tracks like that, bit more bumpy on the straight, maybe we can suffer more because the visibility already is quite low with the new car compared to last year. And then that is definitely not helping. But it's only the very beginning of this development of the new car. So I'm sure everybody can or maybe will find a way of figuring it out.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Alfa Romeo
Kevin Magnussen,"It's certainly one of the more enjoyable ones, you know, because of the element of surprise also, getting back into Formula 1, and not expecting that, and then going and having such a weekend was just so surprising. And I guess, something that rates very high in the results, although P5 isn't the best result I've had, it was very surprising and satisfying. I don't know. I mean, it's not like I felt very rusty. I'm not expecting to get a huge amount better. But everyone is still, I guess, learning about the cars, and there's going to be a race to kind of get fully on top of these cars. But no, I don't feel like there's going to be massive improvements for me. I felt very good in Bahrain and I felt on top of it. Just going to get physically better. I was sore in my neck the day after the race. But it didn't really hold me back. So I'm quite happy.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Haas
Daniel Ricciardo,"I feel OK. Thank you. It was a little a little more physical than it probably should have been. Yeah, it was like that. But yeah, I would say like, each day is kind of just gets better and better. So, I feel OK. Thank you for asking. I mean, there has to be, you know. That's what we work towards. And we'll keep working towards it until we get to see the light, if you will. I think it's going to be a bit of a process now. It's not an overnight change. It's not a change that can happen in the space of a week, you know, so maybe here at this circuit maybe it plays more to our car, and we do a little better, but I think we have some kind of bigger changes to address to get us in a, let's say, top five position. But that's what we have to work harder now than ever for to get there. So at some point, we'll get there. Yeah, we're aware of some of the situations when we come here, we're informed. But I think by coming here, we also have a chance to create some change or have some positive influence. As opposed to not coming here. I know F1’s doing a lot. 40% of staff are females here this weekend, 600 I think underprivileged kids, orphans and underprivileged kids are here today at the track to be educated be inspired. Is at McLaren, we're working with KAUST, which is the first co-ed university here in Saudi Arabia. So, inspiring, trying to create some opportunities. So I think there is, let's say, a positive impact we can have when coming here. We're still trying to do more and do our best to create that or influence that in a better way. And, of course we're aware of some of the other issues, but we're trying to create a good change or have a good impact from us being here.And for now, that's all we can do. I think. Yeah, I guess I'm not too sure how to answer it. Again, if we could have positive impact or learn or educate. I mean, even from being here last year until now, it's only a few months, but I feel I've tried to at least understand a bit more and learn a bit more about it. So if speaking to, let's say, a group of people could help them. Why not? But I think for now the best thing is to remain open-minded and to see that we're aware there is room for change here. And if participating in certain things helps, then I think we're very open to do so. I can answer quickly from my side. I'll jump in. We haven't had too much of it. Yeah, that's probably as far as my answer goes. I think we've, as a team, have been suffering less with the porpoising. And, yeah, I look at some on boards of the others and I'm sure there's a few sore heads after a long race. Everything is already quite intense with a helmet on, balaclava and everything, so it’s quite easy to end a race dehydrated or with a headache. So yeah, it doesn't always look comfortable for the others but for myself it's been quite, I say myself in Lando, it's been quite chilled for now. Yeah, I'm expecting to see more beautiful beards like yours, Matt. It's getting better by the week. I think your camera as well, the quality's better, so we can really see the definition. The real girth on that beard. It's gorgeous. I'm excited to go home. Definitely. You know, it's been a while and yeah, I've heard sales have been nuts and it's going to be an awesome atmosphere. So I cannot wait. Max is cheering. He's excited to go as well. Obviously it's personal to me, because I'm Aussie, and it's a home one and that's a privilege. But every driver I speak to about Melbourne, they love it. They love it as an event. And it's exciting to go through the track changes as well this year, see what kind of racing that produces. So just a big bundle of excitement. Nearly as big as your beard.",Saudi Arabia,friday,McLaren
Nicholas Latifi,"Yeah, I think after the second round of pre-season testing, it was clear we were not going to be where we wanted to be and where we hoped to be before any of the pre-season started. In large part, we had a lot of the same limitations that we had with last year's car, and Bahrain was always one of our weakest tracks last year. So in that respect, I guess it wasn't surprising. Well, it’s not nice to say it wasn't surprising that we were where we were. So I guess coming here it's a completely different track and again, based off these feelings we had last year, it should suit us slightly better. At the same time, I'm under no illusion. I don't expect us to make a massive step up in performance. So yeah, we have a lot of work ahead of us for sure. You have to be quite patient as well, as you know, everything takes a lot of time in F1 and we just have to learn to optimise more what we have right now. As well from my side there is a bunch of things I didn't do correctly last weekend, in both tyre preparation and qualifying as well. Managing these new tyres in the race is a completely different challenge I feel compared to last year's tyres, but still just as sensitive in a way. And yeah, just make steps bit by bit.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Williams
Max Verstappen,"Well, not entirely happy, but I was still in second, which would have been, of course, a good amount of points. But unfortunately we couldn't finish the race. But still a lot of things we learned, because we more or less completed the whole race. So we had a lot of information from that. And, yeah, we'll try to implement that here. Of course, the track is a bit different, but it was a good understanding of the first proper race distance on the car. No, it didn't. I expected more, but we have our reasons for that. So that's why we'll try to do better here. I do think it was a tiny bit better. But I don't think Bahrain is the best example because of tyres overheating, and once you're following for like two laps you just start sliding too much, even if you can follow a little bit better. So, I think there will be some other tracks where the deg of the tyre is a bit lower and then for sure you will be able to follow a bit longer. But it felt like it was a bit better. And that's why I guess we had a fight for like two or three laps instead of only one. Yeah, well, we didn't encounter it in testing. So we didn't know about it at all. And I don't know how we would have spotted it. You can say, in a way, it’s unlucky, but it shouldn't happen. It's as simple as that. Because, you know, to retire basically three cars was  pretty bad. I mean, there is no way around that. And we have to do better. If we want to fight for the title you cannot have too many races like, like we had in Bahrain. I'm sure we'll talk about it with Stefano. But at the moment, I'm not really interested to take part in it. It's also just taking more time. And we're already doing so many things. And I don't really… I saw the benefit initially, of course, to get more popularity. But for me, now, I think you reach a stage where it's a bit more like keeping up with the Formula 1 world, if you know my reference… I think it shouldn't be like that. It's better just to make a season review by F1 itself. I think that's way nicer to look at. But that's my opinion, nobody needs to share my opinion. I just don't like to be a part of it. Visibility will be a bit more tricky. And the bouncing, we'll find out. I don't know my car is going to respond to here. But if you do get it, it's not going to be enjoyable with such high speeds for such a long time. I've read about the changes but I haven't walked the track or anything. So probably on my lap, I’ll just take a bit more of a good look at it. But it's going to be different. But it's the same for everyone, right? So we just have to deal with it and we know that the first sector is not… It’s really cool to drive, don't get me wrong but it is definitely, not the safest when you have to guide through traffic and stuff. But yeah, we'll see how it goes. I'm always happy to talk. I'm not against that. And you know, Stefano is a great guy and you can talk to him about anything. Well, I watched a few episodes of the last one and I was surprised as I suddenly found myself talking in it. And it's probably stuff from like, 2018 or something they picked up and used again, about fighting and what I like to do. But that already is not correct. I could hear that my voice was a bit different. And I realised also, actually, a lot of times I was saying stuff, and they were with this beam around, and they pick up a lot of stuff. So I have to be a bit more careful with that as well. It's just not my thing. And then of course, they all tried to pick, throughout the whole season, they tried to pick moments and fabricate in a way. And for me personally, what I didn't like and it's not even about me, it was about Lando and Daniel, who I think are two great guys. They're really nice, first of all, and made it look like Lando was a bit of a dick, which he isn't at all. And again, you know, I think… I know Lando and I think many people know Lando as a funny guy, a great guy. He has a great character. And actually when you look at that episode, you really think who is this guy? What the hell is going on? And I think when you're new to the sport you don't like you've never seen a racing car or a Formula 1 car in general, they don't like him. And why should that be? Because he is a great guy. And you just immediately get a wrong picture of a person. And that's exactly what I think happened to me in the beginning. And then I think I'm someone who, when you ruin it from the start, you don't fix it. That's it, you ruined it. So that's my stance. And that's how I'll go forward. Yeah, well, during testing, of course, brakes are getting hot and we were trying to make fixes and we thought it would have been just about enough for the race. But of course, when you're fighting and close to a car, they get warmer. That's why I had to lift a lot. After my battle with Charles, basically, the third lap, I had to back out because my brakes are literally on fire. So, I had to be really careful with that. It was not worth it to try and force something when you know you have no brakes. We'll try to make a fix on that, because that's costing lap-time. So, I hope of course, this weekend will be better already. And yeah, with the pitstop, something happened when we dropped the car. My steering got damaged, so it wasn't very enjoyable to drive after that. And also, I had to defend from Carlos on the restart with that. I was not really sure what was going to happen with the balance and the behaviour of the car but in the end, it didn't matter with the retirement, but also there, I think we made a fix, that wouldn't happen again. So yeah, quite a few little things we have to get on top of but the positive overall is that the car is competitive and that's the most important. These things we had, I think they’re are easier fixes than when you have a uncompetitive car. I think it was quite clear in Bahrain, what we were allowed to do and not. Of course, every track is a bit different, so you have you need to have discussions again about what you think and feel and ad work together with it. But Bahrain was straightforward. And I think that's what we all want, right? We want clear understanding of what's happening. I think we can all agree that Ferrari has the slowest car that's for sure. It’s all Carlos and Charles! Yeah, pretty similar. I think I do know what I want to go faster. It's just I don't have it yet. So yeah, I'm trying to find that balance to go faster. But with these cars, the extra weight and low speed makes it quite a tricky car to set up. But of course, it is also very track dependent. So Bahrain, you have more low speed corners, it's really hard on tyres. So let's say low speed it doesn't feel fantastic, Here, it's completely different: street circuit, so grip is different – but also a lot more high speed corners, so you are definitely chasing something else from the car. I hope it works for us but yeah, we'll find out soon.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, maybe I was a bit too negative after a race because still, you know, we managed to finish on the podium and bring home a 1-2, but yeah, it is not a lie that I was probably not very happy with a car and just not driving it the way I should have, and probably just not understanding this new generation of cars 200%. But I'm working on it. And I'm feeling like I also need to bring the car a bit more to my driving style, to my liking. And as soon as I feel a bit more comfortable the results and the pace will come. But still without feeling very confident and comfortable in the car we managed to bring home a P2, it would have been a P2 without Max’s retirement. But yeah, exciting times ahead. And I think some time to find. Yeah, we are getting there. Obviously it is an important contract in my career and I really wanted to make sure that everything was done and both Ferrari and I were happy with what we are signing. And yeah, we are very close to finalising it. It still needs the last details. But yeah, it looks good for the future. I agree with all of them. All three have said interesting things, which I actually agree with. I think the steps that have been done are going in the right direction, but are very small. It's not like in 100 days between the last race and here you can do much more to such a big circuit. So yeah, I think for the future, we just need to keep working together to maybe try and improve a bit the visibility of this circuit, because in 100 days… I like what has been done, but it's still on the limit. And we need to be making the circuit maybe a bit more… to have a bit more visibility. Because as Max said, the first sector is super fun to drive, it’s actually one of my favourite sections of the of the calendar, but we need to keep improving it. …and the Red Bull is very reliable too! In all honesty, not yet. Not a lot. I feel like if I compare myself to the end of last year, last year, I knew exactly what I need to do to the car in order to go faster at each track,  and what I need from from the suspension, the aero, and everything and I just… every time I went to new track at the end of the year, I knew exactly where to set it up and what would work for each track. With this car, very little. I mean, we've had a good winter testing and we've been consistent and we've been running a very similar car across the test and into the first race; we've developed it, we found our setup direction that seemed to work well in Bahrain–  but I have no idea of the setup is going to work in Jeddah, we're going to need to change it much or not. So, I think we need races, we need samples, we need time and on the personal side I just need to keep experimenting, keep trying diections and see ,what the car likes and what I like as a driver also. Oh, I think that's a combination of two things. I think Charles did a very good job in Bahrain and he found his groove with the car and he was very quick straight out of the box and very competitive, while maybe I was lacking a bit of feeling with a car, a bit of fiddling with the setup from testing maybe didn’t set up the car completely to my liking – but I think it's only one race, so I think it's very difficult to tell after one race if I have adapted or not. I think we need more races, we need more samples, as I said before, and maybe Jeddah is a different story – and that's why I think we need to give ourselves a bit of time and see what the tendency is,  and keep working on the setup front, put it a bit more to my liking, and as soon as it is there,  I know I can be quick with any car – like we showed last year. So, a bit of patience, still 22 races to go, so early days.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Ferrari
Mick Schumacher,"Yeah, it was obviously positive. The car feels a lot better than last year, it's a lot more competitive, obviously. We had a car in the top five, which is amazing for the team. So I’m really, really proud of that. And it just shows the potential of the car. So we have everything to play for. And I think we have a good season ahead of us. I think it wasn't as it was before, that's for sure. But the damage wasn't huge. So you know, obviously we were struggling a bit more than we hoped for after that but nonetheless it's racing. These things happen. You come close to each other and yeah, I came away with a nice 360 there, so that's alright. It's amazing to see the difference. You know, everybody's super-motivated, everybody's super-happy to be working and to have a car to look forward to and to see the progression, especially from a very poor last year, the poor performance last year in the car. I think that there's more to come. We have upgrades planned and stuff. That's something that I haven't had last year. Definitely, yeah, I'm sure they will keep on growing and keep on improving. Obviously, the first part of Drive to Survive, the first seasons, are quite interesting, and quite dramatic. And I think that brings a lot of people to the sport. But I guess as the show progresses it's important to become more accurate with some of the things and maybe don't mix up some of the comments or radio messages and stay true to how it actually was on track. I think that that would make more sense. And maybe chronological order could also make more sense. But again, I’m not the producer of the show, so it's just an opinion. I've seen the changes. And probably they are into the right direction. But I think they don't improve visibility and especially in the first section where visibility was an issue and where things did get quite close last year. I just wonder if there's maybe something else we have to do to get the safety up. And I guess, as Max said, also the visibility of the of this year's car is a bit different, a bit more difficult. So I guess we'll just have to try and find out on the fly how it goes. I don’t know, it’s hard to say. We had obviously only one race, one test and stuff in our test go just as planned, so I think we still have a lot of margin in terms of performance that I think we can exploit. Overall, I'm happy about the progression that we made in our car. I can't speak for the other two cars, so I guess that for sure one of them will say that their car’s the fastest but I guess we'll have to see over the year. Then it's good to know that we have the fastest car! Thank you very much!",Saudi Arabia,friday,Haas
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, it was very close. It's a bit of a bittersweet memory, of course. But, you know, nevertheless, it was, it was a great race weekend here last year, finishing with 12 points, P4, qualified in the top 10. The car was very competitive and it's a track that I felt comfortable with straightaway, to get my foot in. So, yeah, I can't wait to feel those new cars, the high speed is usually a very strong point for these 2022 cars. And that's most of what you have here. So it's going to be very interesting. It's a good start. It was a very positive start to finish with both in the top 10. Of course, we want a little bit more performance to get closer to the cars in front, we're always looking for it. We have a way of working that we think is the right one, and it's going in the right direction. As always, both me and Fernando give very close feedback together. So that's good. And hopefully we can, you know, make that into some good developments in the future for the car. I think I will join Pierre on the comments. I think, of course, it's good to have an opening, you know, from the outside world of Formula 1. I think it has been a big benefit to have Netflix on board. Just to show how it works from the inside as well. But it's important, I think, to stick to how we are in reality. But yeah, for me it has been has been positive. I think it's very similar to last year, in my opinion. Of course it's very high speed here. It's very enjoyable to drive but I think still the way we were working with engineers from last year, just telling us if there is a slow car in front and all that, it’s still going to be valid this year. So yeah, we'll be as careful as we can. I think it will be very close. I think it's gonna be very close the whole year. I mean we've seen in quali, there's not much separating all of us, but I think at the moment the Haas looks the best package.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Alpine
Pierre Gasly,"It was frustrating not to see the chequered flag for the first race of the year. And until we had the issue I think we had a pretty clean race, a well executed strategy. Performance-wise it was great. We were fighting in the points and it was good to see. We expected a pretty tough race, because we saw Haas and Alfa Romeo were pretty strong, we knew it would quite close with Alpine and we still managed to end up in that P8 quite comfortably. So it was a shame, but still it's positive to see we have the performance to fight for some points. I guess it’s the same as everyone, we are still not in a position that we would like with the car, not as comfortable as what we would like and hope for. But it's our job to improve that and find some directions to find more performance. Similar comments. I think we had the cleanest testing of all the years I've done with that team. So we came into the first race quite confident in terms of reliability. But I must say, motorsport keeps you very humble all the time, because these things happen and it’s obviously painful on our side and there was no sign that this was going to happen. But obviously it should not happen. We lost quite a lot of points. And so it was clearly not the ideal start to the season. It was different problems with Max and Checo. But clearly things that that we need to sort out and can’t have in the future. No warning at all. It was just all on-off out of Turn 1, the whole car switched off. And that was it pretty much. I must say, I haven't seen the whole series, so I haven't seen like [more than] pretty much the first two episodes. You can clearly see that some scenes are kind of made up for the show. It's difficult to speak for the drivers, I'm not in their position. I don't know how they [Netflix) get on with other guys. I think on our side with Yuki, which is what I can compare, it was kind of normal. But obviously as a driver you don't want to be portrayed differently than the person you are in reality. I think that's the main thing that we ask for, you know. We're happy to play our part in the show but as long as it kind of reflects who we are personally. On my side, I never had any issue. I never felt like they were kind of changing or adding more drama than we had. I think we had enough drama over the last three years. Didn't need more. But I understand Stefano. I think it makes sense for us as well. Not much to add, I mean, at such high speed it's always going to be dangerous. And this year with a bit less visibility than last year. We all know it's a kind of dangerous track. And we all deal with it the best way we can, but I think it just requires definitely more attention from all of us. [you have to] pay more attention than any other track. But the changes have been made are a step in the right direction. Whether it's going to be enough or not, this will we'll find out this weekend. Well yeah, it was battery related but yeah, it was all safe. Everything worked. As expected, after that, obviously, when you stop on track, and there was a shortcut, and it was enough to start the fire at the back of the car, and basically the whole thing went into flames. But yeah, in terms of safety, there was no concern at all. And obviously, we have some fixes for this weekend. Can’t guarantee that it won't happen again, but surely we’ll try to do everything we can on our side, at least for now, to make sure we don't face such a situation again, because it wasn't nice. I mean, especially at that part of the track, where it happened. I didn't really realise initially, there was the fire coming out of the car. But it wasn't a nice feeling. At the end was all fine. Haas! I think so far, I mean we've done only two tracks. I really believe that it might be quite different from track to track, but so far from what we've seen, they look the most competitive but yeah, we'll make sure we give them a hard time as soon as possible.",Saudi Arabia,friday,AlphaTauri
Charles Leclerc,"It feels good. A lot more smiles around in the team and you can really feel the extra motivation that it gives to be back fighting for the top positions. I haven't been back in Maranello, but Mattia was there and was telling me that everyone is super motivated and super happy about the first race. So it's great to see that.  The last two years again, have been very, very difficult but I think we have prepared in the best way possible this new season. And it’s great to see the results on track so now we need to keep pushing more than ever to keep this position. But it feels nice to be back at least fighting for top positions. Not one in particular because obviously the cars are so different compared to the ones of last year so it's very difficult to make any comparison. But overall, I was very happy with the balance, which I think gives the drivers the confidence to push in qualifying, but also in the race and that was a very important aspect. But on the other hand, everything was working very well, I think we have a very solid car for now so it's nice. I think will be in the mix for this weekend for sure.  Whether we are favourite or not I don't know. I don't think so. I don't want to believe so. I think Red Bull are going to be extremely strong around here. So yeah, let's wait and see. I think we'll have the answer a bit later on today but yeah, I don't want us to feel like favourites at least. Yes, I did. Well, I think first because as a driver, I felt like I'm better than what I was in 2019 especially in the race pace. I think it was definitely one of my weakest points in 2019, I was always quite strong in qualifying, always managed to put the lap when it mattered, but then on tyre management especially I was quite weak so I put a lot of work into it. 2020 I got much better. 2021, again much better and actually last year, it was probably my strongest point was the tyre management and the race management so yeah, in Bahrain everything was much more under control. There was obviously moments where it was very tricky with Max pushing massively behind but overall, I had the control of my pace, of my tyres and everything felt good. Yes, same,  as I said yesterday I did a track walk before yesterday and there was slight changes especially in the last part of the of the track which might be a bit better for traffic but there was also this first part of the track that was quite tricky and there I don't think there was any change. But let's wait and see. Again maybe from the cars it looks better than what it is. Well, first of all, I can feel the difference from the car, the progress that's been made from last year to this year and this is nice, it's the result of all the work of the guys back in Maranello and it's also a reason why we are much more competitive this year so it's great to see that. On the other hand, I don't think we have any advantage. I think we are very similar to where Red Bull is at the moment which they seem to be very strong, power unit-wise and we need to keep pushing but yeah, it is definitely a big step from last year. The side pods. For a start, definitely the side pods. For us, we cannot see the yellow line at all when we are parking to start the race. But then for the actual visibility I don’t have any problems. How do you call it the arcs, yeah, whatever. This I don’t  have any problems and actually the visibility is fine for us. Again, I think we should wait and see. On a straight track it's normal to see red flags and I don't think that because we've seen two red flags it's more concerning than anywhere else. I think it's expected on a track that is so challenging and on a city track so yeah let's wait and see and maybe I'll go a bit more into details after the first few laps this afternoon. Well, yeah, I think that it is quite clear what we are allowed to do in the in a race, battling with each other now and yeah, we will be right at the limit of the rules as it's always been the case and that's the way I enjoy racing when it's hard but fair and when the limits are very clear, and I think it is, so whether there's Lewis at the back or not this… I will be racing the same way and yeah,  but hopefully we'll also be as competitive as we were in Bahrain for the rest of the season for these fights to happen.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"It will be interesting to see, first of all, how different it is to… if the team order from  Bahrain changes are all in this circuit. You know, it is a very different one. So yeah, it will be interesting. I really hope we are in the mix. I definitely believe that things are going to be really close between a couple of teams,  so yeah, like Charles says, you know, we will have more idea later today. I don't think there's anyone in here that has… that is at one with the car yet. You know, I think we are all experimenting on how to drive best with these cars, how to set them in the best shape for your driving and how to take the best out of them. You know, we've gone into a very extreme regulation, very different to what we've been used to. So yeah, I think at the moment all we drivers and teams, we are getting there. But we are far from 100%. Well, I think in the short period of time, it was nice to see that they managed to do something. To be honest, I have to wait until I drive to make a comparison to last year and see what else we can do to make it even better. I think last year, it was something that was nice, you know, that nothing happened in the race but it was really on the limit of safety and yeah, I think I only can wait until I drive the car to see how much we have improved that. Yeah, we're pretty convinced that we managed to get on top of it. And it was the same issue with both cars. But there was always different… and at different points. But then, at the end of the day, it was the same cause and we believe that we have the problem sorted.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"More or less happy, I have to say.  We came to Bahrain with not a clear idea on where we were exactly in terms of performance, and we went into Q3 nearly with both cars and then as you said, double points for the team. So we have to be happy and proud in a way after the difficult winter for us,  especially in Barcelona we were struggling a little bit but then in Bahrain we were more happy and the race was good. But let's say the first couple of races it's going to be interesting to see where and how fast we are. I think Jeddah is going to be the first test for us is a completely different circuit than Bahrain, then Australia, Imola and probably by that [time], I think we should know where we are. No one knows that. And we don't know it. On the first question, yeah, I'm happy, I’m happy to be here. I came to the sport here for these regulations and the hope that it gives to everyone to have a closer competition between teams and the budget cap and try to reduce the differences between the teams. And on the other question, I think they should be quite relaxed. You know, I guess. I've been 20 years here and keep… they changed, you know, some bosses on the teams that I was and in the teams that I was not there, they changed as well. But, you know, this is the nature of Formula 1. I guess so. We were 1.2 seconds from pole position so we tried to understand where are the strengths of the car and the weaknesses and try to attack those as soon as possible on the next few races and some developments that are coming. But yeah, I think there's still some work to do for sure in the car. Everyone will improve massively in the next two or three months and we know that we need to make an extra step if we want to compete for higher things Will not share here, probably. Yeah, I think tonight we will have a better opinion. I only did the trial walk yesterday, seems not to big a change but maybe in the car it makes a big difference. So let's wait and see. For us, definitely a step on our side as well, not only on power, pure power, also the concept of the engine is completely different, and, you know, it was a lot of work on this project for already one year and a half or something. So, you know, I think they did a very good job in Paris and we happy with our power unit now, progress everyone… we are very similar. I don't think that we have a huge disadvantage or huge advantage. And that was maybe not the case last year so we’re happy with this step forward. It was okay. I didn't find any big issue in Bahrain. I think it's more the tyres. It is different, compared last year, they are bigger. But you get used them to very, very fast like with the halo but no, no problem. I think we went into the race – obviously the details we will not share here – there are a couple of points that maybe we identify that we were doing differently between the two cars. Also, we had different tyre age in different moments of the race. Some of the teams had new tyres, Esteban had new tyres and maybe that also was it was a difference but nevertheless, we ended up both cars in the points and that was the goal at the beginning. I'm not sure that's a question for me, I only drive cars as fast as I can and you know, I try to feed back the team you know, with what I feel is necessary on the behaviour of the car but the way and you know, we go into design production and creativity and things I think we have the right people in charge of it. Laurent made a few changes over the last two years on the management side as well so I guess everything is going in the right direction. So we trust those changes.",Saudi Arabia,friday,Alpine
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah. I'm quite happy what the position I ended up, because I didn't expect this race before the race start. But yeah, the performance in long run in the race was quite good and also we are kind of happy for what we achieved with progress through the race week in Bahrain. Yeah, also was possible that we ended up with both cars and points. We got a little bit unfortunate retirement from Pierre, due to the issue. But yeah, in Bahrain I was quite happy what we have achieved. It's hard to say.  I think, in the race, we were… kind of the conference we had from Bahrain… I mean Barcelona test. We were more like having question mark about performance and we managed… Pierre managed to go Q3 in Bahrain, but I think we're still feeling on the edge. And we have to know the place we want to fight so yeah, hopefully, of course we've focused more developing the car and trying consistently on top, you know, top midfield but currently, I think we're not that position we're fighting so just refocus what we have to do, develop the car and still 22 races to go so hopefully we can have a good development through the year. It's early to say how is the feedback for the modifications but yeah, we'll see after free practice one and hopefully the visibility issue gets better.",Saudi Arabia,friday,AlphaTauri
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, so happy. I mean again I keep repeating myself but the last two years have been incredibly difficult for the team and we knew this was going to be a big opportunity for the team and the guys have done such an incredible job giving us and building this amazing car. So for now it's starting in the best way possible: pole position, victory, fastest lap, one-two today with Carlos, we couldn't hope for better. So yeah, thank you to all of you guys that kept supporting us in the past few years. It hasn't been easy but it's incredible to be back at the top. Yeah, I was trying to be as clever as possible using the DRS as much as possible so I was trying to break early into Turn 1 just to be behind him at the DRS detection and twice it worked out, so I took back my first position and just incredibly happy that we made it work. I didn't want it now but then I did a great restart. And then that gave me a little bit of margin to then manage my race until the end. It feels amazing. Obviously, after yesterday, it already felt great. But yeah, we had to finish the business today and we did a one-two. So it's the perfect start to the season. And I'm incredibly happy after the last two years that have been very difficult for the team, for myself, for, obviously, Carlos also last year. We had to work extremely hard. And we did work hard and well. And yeah, to finally prove that all the work that we've done in the past two years is paying off, feels amazing. Yeah. It feels good. I did a bit of a joke on the radio on the last lap, saying that there was something strange with the engine, which gave a heart attack to some of the engineers I'm sure, but everything was fine. So yeah, very happy that this time we brought it home. Well, I only followed into Turn 2, because I was always behind only for one corner and would Max back into Turn 4. But it was tricky. It was nice though. It was on the limit, hard racing. But we will always give each other space, which was nice, and following him into Turn 2 was actually a bit more predictable than what I expected or what I had last year. So this was good. But it was always very close. I would always try and brake very early into Turn 1 to get the DRS for Turn 4 and it worked out three times in a row. So then I could keep my lead. And it was always also very tricky because I was struggling quite a lot with my energy and had to manage that too. But then after the third lap, I think I was in a better window with it and could push again and manage to have a bit of margin to manage my race. Well, it’s just to have a bit of a different strategy between our two cars and to hopefully put Max in a bit of a difficult situation and for Carlos to try and get him towards the end by having a slightly different strategy. I don't think at the end it was possible for Carlos to do the alternate strategy because… I don't know, I haven't seen the race but I guess it wasn't possible because at the end we did a soft, soft, medium both of us, but the thinking behind was just a slightly different strategy between the two cars. Yes, on the first one I think I did a small mistake on my in lap and also we had a bit of a problem on the front right at the pit stop which cost us a bit of lap time and that puts us in a bit of a tricky situation after the first pit stop. I didn't really know how much grip I will gain from these new tyres and also on the out lap I was not pushing as much as I could and I was probably a bit under the limit and Max was right behind. He had already done one lap with the tyres so he was already pretty much on the limit of the tyres and it was very tricky to keep him behind. But I managed to do so hopefully. And then on the second one, it was just a bit smoother, the in lap was a little bit better. I think I still had some tyres left, so I could push and the pit stop was also better so it was a bit more under control and we probably also took a bit more margin, seeing how the first one went. For the safety car, obviously I wasn't very happy to see the safety car out. I was very happy when I saw the virtual safety car because that would mean that I would have a big gap to the second place but I lost everything with the safety car. But I quickly said to myself that is the way it is, and I had to stay calm and to try and do the best restart possible, which I did, and then manage my race to the end. Yeah, I think that they went for a three-stop strategy. I felt quite nice at that point with my tyres, to go to the end, but obviously when I saw that they would pit, I was a bit concerned – and that's why I made my thoughts clear to the team, that maybe it will have been good to just cover him and stay in front and, and have our race like this, a bit on the safer side but yeah, after once they told me that it was… that we had to stay out, I just agreed. They have so much more data than I do in the car. And if they were confident to do so, it gave me the confidence to also just get on with my work, and bring the car home at the end. So yeah, I just wanted to make sure that they questioned all the scenarios before we took a decision. I think it's a very good problem to have. I mean, coming into the season we surely knew that we were going to be in a better position compared to the past two years but we didn't really know where, and now we see that we are actually in the mix to fight for the title so it's amazing! I think we are both very, very happy to have a car that is capable of winning. And yeah, we’ll fight for it, for sure. Yeah, it wasn't the smoothest ride I had in a Formula 1 car but it was definitely a fast one so it's OK like this, but we need to keep working on that because I'm pretty sure that on some tracks it might be more of an issue compared to this one where we had the porpoising problem, it was for a straight line braking.  In Jeddah I see some places where it might be coming in a place where, I can't remember, there are way too many corners in Jeddah, but the fast left where I crashed last year. This one, with porpoising, might be quite tricky, so yeah, it is definitely something that we need to keep in our mind and work on. But I think it's clear for everyone in the team. But it hasn't been too bad and I think we have improved massively compared to the first test. And again, from the test to the race here, we improved another step. So yeah, we just need to keep working in that direction.",Bahrain,post-race,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, well, first of all, congrats to Charles, congrats to Ferrari. Ferrari is back and it is properly back, no, with a one-two and where the team should have been over the last two years but the hard work is paying off and we are there. For me it’s been a very tricky weekend, I'm not going to lie. I didn't have the pace today. But I managed to hold in there and bring the one-two for the team. I have some homework to do over these next few days and I'm sure I will come back stronger. At the restarts, I had a good, strong chance because I had a very clean restart behind Charles and Max. He defended well, to be fair. And then suddenly I started seeing some flashing red lights on the back of his car. And I said ‘okay, this is my chance’ and I went for it. He was unfortunate. I think today he was driving well enough to get P2 but yeah, I had a good run on him and then he had to retire. So it's what it is. And it's good for Ferrari. I feel great. I'm particularly happy for the whole team. It's massive, you know, after two difficult years to be back and be on a one-two, it shows that all the hard work has just paid off and that we are back in the fight, back to where Ferrari should be, and congratulations to Charles because I think he drove a really good race. And he's been on it the whole weekend. So to bring home this one-two means a lot to all of us and to all the tifosi and for sure today, we need to celebrate because it’s a huge day. It would have been very tricky. I had a run at him into Turn 1. But they seem to have very good top speed. And I never really quite got ahead of him. But I gave it my best shot. He defended very well to be fair, and then it was going to be tight because I was on the limit of the DRS zone. I think if I would have kept the DRS then I would have given him a run. And then he started facing the problems that we saw. And in that sense, I guess I could be lucky that I could pass him and then finish P2. But he has been driving also very well all weekend so it’s tough to see. But at the same time we've also done a very good job in reliability, it also counts. Yeah that that was, as Charles said, the plan, to make sure that we were running a reverse on Max because they were either going to choose new or used also. We elected for the used and this probably made me fall a bit too behind in the first stint because Charles was pushing very hard at the front and Max was nearly managing to keep up with him on the used and me on the used just reflected a bit the struggles that I've had all weekend that is just I'm not quite there with the car yet. I'm not managing very well the tyres and suffering a bit with the rear and it's just confirmed a bit the deficit that I had going into quali that for some reason in quali disappeared but in the race it came back and it just exposed a bit my limitations and it's something that I need to look at and see where I can gain that lap time back. Yes, same. It’s just great news for Ferrari and for us because it's where Ferrari should be and it’s where Charles and I want to be in our lives, fighting for World Championships. It’s still going to be a long year, we still need to make sure that we develop well this car, because at the moment it is a quick car, as Lewis said, but it also needs to be quick the whole year, to keep us in the fight. And it's a great problem to have, actually. Before the race, Charles and I were working together and the first thing that we said to each other is how good it feels, just to be starting first and third and to finally be fighting for something bigger, and together. And we kind of had that moment of just realising that we are in the fight this year, and it was… between us a good moment to reflect and to realise that we are a lot luckier in that sense that last year, and we have a good fight in our hands. Yeah, to be fair, I mean in FP1, FP2 and FP3 I was very far behind, the most far that I've been ever in Ferrari and that's why even with a one-two that we scored I'm not entirely happy with the weekend because as a Ferrari driver it’s been my most difficult weekend and it just shows that I need to put my head down, understand this car, understand where is Charles making the difference with his driving and the way that he's approaching the corners and driving the tyres, also in the race. And I need to improve if I want to fight for a win and I will put my head down and try to do some steps coming into Jeddah. Can I improve it from one weekend to another? I think I can improve it. Can I cut down the deficit completely? It’s a very good question. I wish I can and I will be working hard for it but I still need to understand everything and I still need to analyse everything with my with my engineers to come back stronger and yeah, in the end later let the bad weekends as a Ferrari driver be a P2 and I'll take it and move on. Same not the smoothest of rides, but you definitely can complete a race distance with the amount of porpoising that we had, that we actually had a bit, both in qualifying and in the race, but I see some other tracks that could bring the issue. Best example is Jeddah and we need to see how much progress we've actually done since Barcelona because the tarmac there is a lot closer and the type of bouncing could be closer to Barcelona that we struggle a lot more and we need to analyse how much we’ve moved on since then. But full trust the team is doing everything they can because they know there's performance on it. And we are trying to solve it completely.",Bahrain,post-race,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, firstly, a big, big congratulations to Ferrari. So happy to see them doing well again. They are such a historic, epic team. So it's great to see them. It's great to see Carlos and Charles up there as well. So congratulations to them. I think yeah, it was such a difficult race, we struggled throughout practice. This is really the best result we could have got and of course it was unfortunate for the other two drivers. But we did the best we could and we're grateful for these points. I'm hoping! I know the guys are working really hard back to the factory and it’s not going to be a quick turnaround, but I know that… we all know as a team, I do feel like we've been the best unified team for so long. I know that we all know that just keep your head down, keep working. There's a long, long way to go. For sure. Well, firstly, big congratulations to these guys. It’s great to see them up here. It's a lot of red. But really happy to see these guys shine and be back up there. It’s you know… With the national anthem, also just the team and the energy that they always bring. It's nice to see. I know they had a difficult year last year but they kept pushing, so it's great to see them back. But I hope that we can get in the battle with them at some stage. I had a moment where I thought for a second that I was going to have a little bit of a battle with Carlos but it was only for five laps and then after that they were gone. I definitely didn't expect to be up here. Of course I woke up this morning and I was hopeful and we did everything we could, praying as hard as we could to get the best results, but ultimately it came down to just really hard work from the whole team both here and back at the factory. We have a lot of work to do. We have quite a big deficit in performance but this is a great start still. Oh, well one, we've got a reliable car and two they're much faster. But we kind of knew that already. No, I don't think so. But of course we've learned a lot from this week. Their straight line speed as well as the Bulls were very quick in a straight line and their performance through corners is quite a bit different to us. So the car was very hard to drive but it could always be worse. So I’m hoping for the next race we manage to find some improvements but it's a fundamental issue that’s going to take a little bit longer I think to fix. I don't have a response to it. I just focused on our job. Obviously it was unfortunate for them today but, yeah, I just focus on positives. Look it's such early days. Reliability of course is always a key player, but with the performance they have, they look strong. To be able to come back strong in the next races I think for us, we just keep our head down.  We've got a lot of work to do, we're not currently fighting them necessarily on track. So that's what we'll focus on. Yeah, huge, honestly. I think incredibly motivating probably for the whole team. Given that we have been faced with these challenges which we were not expecting, and but just no one's been down during this phase where we've been struggling through practice. Everyone’s stayed positive, everyone's just kept their head down and kept working. No one's moaned.  And that's great to see. And so whilst we don't have the performance of these other guys, I think, in terms of our processes, in terms of squeezing absolutely everything out of the car, I think that's what we did today and for both drivers, and I think that's a true showing of strength within. Of course, it can. Every point can make a difference. I've lost world titles with just one point. Whilst we're currently not necessarily performance-wise fighting with these guys, as I mentioned, this is you know, not damage limitations, but just really, it's a really, really great result. Of course we were fortunate but ultimately we've done a better job, we have better reliability. So I don't necessarily count that all… I wouldn’t say that's luck, I think this is the hard work of everyone. But it is such a long season. It's going to be such a hard battle but we love a challenge. I really do enjoy a challenge. And it is a privilege to work with.. for all of us to be able to work with large teams of people who are hungry, who are focused on a common goal. There's no greater feeling when you all come together and you get a result like this. So yeah. Our’s was a lot better than it had been. Through testing it was killer, you could see for many of us jumping up and down but I think I was probably a little bit worse than perhaps some of the others but yeah, it's a long race to be bouncing up and down. But I'll take it with the performance that we managed to squeeze out. I hope in the next races we can try to reduce that.",Bahrain,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I do think testing did go well. It’s still a bit unclear where we are exactly. Of course on the final day we had an upgrade on the car and that seemed to give us a bit more lap time. Of course I was happy with that, but it’s not the race weekend yet and we will find out in qualifying where we are. Of course, try to be ahead. We’ll find out. I don’t know at the moment. I mean that naturally as a driver you always want to race and you would say ‘yes, we should be allowed to race’ but I think you should also ask a medical expert about it, what is allowed and what isn’t and then work together with the FIA to see what’s possible and what is allowed in the future, but at the moment it’s a bit difficult to tell. I don’t think we need a full report. Of course, always, every year it’s good to discuss what happened in the year before and what you can do better as that’s what teams do as well, right? You always analyse everything you do. We will find out and if things can be written down in an easier way or in a way to understand it better, the wording, then for sure, but let’s see. They might be a little less visible but at the end of the day not a lot has changed luckily, so I am just looking forward to starting the season where we left off, but of course trying to become better. They are still with us so that’s good. Yeah, the facility looks really good and of course I know about the plans and stuff, and what’s coming, so it all looks very promising. And the engine for this year, yeah we made a nice step forward but we have to wait and see what the other teams did as well. From our side I think we did the best we could but it’s never good enough, right? So you have to try to keep improving and trying to find more performance. So that’s what we will try to do from our side. No, I proved that with the most wins and most pole and most laps led. People forget that. They only look at Abu Dhabi apparently but we have more races than Abu Dhabi in a season. I think they will be dead last. According to their comments they have an awful and they’ve had that already since 2017 in pre-season testing. We will find out. I don’t know, but for sure they will be competitive. If you look at last season, even during that season I think yeah, we could have had more wins and more poles even but you need a really competitive car to be able to do that, so it’s going to be really difficult to do something like that again. Of course you always try to do better so I hope if we have a very competitive car again that we can reach something similar. That’s also part of racing in a way. Unfortunately. I think the most important that he feels well, right? Who cares about this race at the end of the day. It’s about that he feels well. I think it’s mainly tyres and weight but luckily the cars also quite quick and it will definitely be a bit different from track to track, in terms of how competitive we are going to be compared to last year. On the other hand there is also not a big shock. It is still a Formula 1 car with a lot of downforce and it is still nice to drive. Lando explained that very well. No… but I was still on the track yesterday, so for me, nothing changes. So maybe we can ban coming to the track on the Thursday, and the team also doesn’t give me anything to do, because at the end of the day I’m still doing exactly the same – but you have to wake up actually earlier on a Friday morning. If it’s not going to change, can we please go back to the old schedule – because at least I can sleep in a bit more? I haven’t met him here in the paddock yet but I’m sure we will anyway during the drivers’ briefing. Let’s see. Let’s find out how it’s going to be. I’m positive that it’s going to be fine. I mean, they all have a lot of experience in racing, so as long as we are clear before we enter the race weekends, it shouldn’t be a problem. The motivation is the same, or even more again, because you want to keep winning and you want to… you just want to be upfront, right? Especially after last year. But yeah, you do… as a little kid you always dream of, of course, trying to be a Formula 1 driver and hopefully one day you win a championship. But that’s achieved, that kind of pressure of wanting and needing to do that is gone… but you still want to win races and stuff. So, that’s what I’m here for. I don’t know. I mean, I guess you shouldn’t ask me that question. I grew up like that, like that can’t happen. Because of… you know, when you are little, you do become lazy at some point. I mean, you still have to learn how to be a professional. So, my Dad made sure that didn’t happen.",Bahrain,friday,Red Bull
Zhou Guanyu,"To be honest it feels quite fresh. Of course it’s the first time, FP1 seems to be not that new for me anymore after the experience I had last season, but overall, all this format, everything is completely new for me but to be honest it was definitely nice to be testing here in T2 here in Bahrain just to get familiar with everything. I am feeling quite ready for the first race weekend but of course there is plenty of stuff for me to digest inside myself to be more ready but I think that just takes a bit of time but overall I am quite happy with how everything went last weekend and the feeling of putting everything together for this weekend. Well, yeah, they covered pretty much everything. You just have to be really on top of yourself and staying always with mask, to do our job right. The others are up to… It’s not my position to discuss or say anything. Nothing to add. I wasn’t in that race and that’s it. No, definitely not dropping scores. Yeah, exactly. For me everything is pretty new but of course with the new era you do feel the change of the weight and the way you have to adapt a little bit your driving style compared to what I have driven in the past with the different Formula 1 cars and of course many teams are suffering with this bouncing issue, since everybody felt it. It’s quite surprising for us to feel it. It was getting better and better and we are finding the right solution for it, but there is plenty of stuff you have to be adapting to and like Lando says, all the teams after testing our speed is very similar. Of course there are a few teams that are a little bit quicker than the rest but it feels like the mid-[ack is a little bit closer than it was last year for sure. Well, for me it was of course the mileage limitation in Barcelona was affecting us as a team, a lot but then we had a big step-up in Bahrain so it much better with upgrades, all of that involved with the car. In terms of feeling, as I mentioned before, the bouncing was something I never experienced in the past and very new for all of us. I think the challenge for all of us as a team is going to be trying to reduce that, in terms of going more towards the ultimate performance of the car. That’s the biggest challenge of the year. Hopefully already at ease – but yeah, we have to say, it’s quite a bit of difference whether you have DRS on or off, and if one is behind a slipstream or not, but I’m sure I’m sure we’ll figure it out. I won’t say how many races but yeah. For me, it’s a fresh start, so wake up early is not a big problem. I’ve experienced that in the past few years, we always were the first one on track, so that’s fine. Of course, it’s much more busy now, compared to my schedule in the past – but I’m OK with all of that. I haven’t met him yet but he did sign my superlicence during the week! So that’s as close as I get to him so far, so yeah, I’m sure, apart from that, everything else will be OK.",Bahrain,friday,Alfa Romeo
Charles Leclerc,"Well, the ones where we have had the least problems for sure, but the smoothest one, for sure too. But then again I don’t want to say it’s our best because then people will straight away come to the conclusion that we are ahead of everyone and it’s not the case. I think we are a bit behind Red Bull. But in terms of smoothness and amount of laps, it definitely is. It has been a very smooth test with a lot of laps, everything that we wanted to test we did, so it’s great. It’s a tricky question. As things are at the moment obviously it’s impossible to do that because in some places we cannot race having COVID. Then, for sure, if there are some places where we will be able to race with COVID then things might change. But yeah, the way things are at the moment I definitely wouldn’t do that. I think it is really important to have that transparency and for us to be able to see it. Whether I will read it, I don’t think so, it will be probably too long, but it is important to at least have the big lines and know what is the conclusion of it, in order to grow from it and to maybe manage those situations better in the future. I wouldn’t want this. Yeah, well, it feels quite a bit different compared to last year. Whether it feels like a new era, I don’t know. We will have to see how much closer we can race. I saw some benefits already from testing but we will have to see in a proper race how much we can race closer. But the weight, for me, of the car changes massively and it is something that I really feel, especially on a track like this with the slow-speed corners. You really need to change your driving style. So the cars are very different and hopefully better for the racing, but this will have to wait. yeah, definitely bouncing will be the biggest challenge, especially for the race. It depends a lot on the conditions also, from where the wind is coming from, we might have some, and the race is quite long, so yeah, it’s going to be pretty bumpy. Then, how many races we need to adapt to those cars. With Ferrari, we’ve had a bit of a different approach this year, staying with the same car from the first test to the second test, which helped us to know the package very well, so hopefully it will give us a bit of an advantage at the beginning. And then for us drivers, I think we’ll all be quite quick to adapt to those new cars. It’s the first race of the season, so I’ve been pretty busy yesterday, so it didn’t change much for me now. Lando said it all. I haven’t met him yet but yeah, consistency is key and I’m pretty sure they are, they have organised themselves fully to work in that way. I’m not too concerned about this.",Bahrain,friday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"We learned a decent amount. Definitely not as much as we wanted to coming into the first race of the year but still in a decent place. I think what makes it tough and what makes it almost worse than previous years is it is looking probably a bit tighter in the midfield than what it has potentially been over the past couple of years. So, therefore you want to be able to have all the information possible and be on top of everything, which we are not 100% on top of coming into this race. We will do our best and we definitely have a few things to work on and few things to make sure they work in the first place and we’ll go from there. Some things I am confident with and other things maybe not so much. Nothing further. I don’t mind seeing them or not. As long as there is a good result and a positive result going forward, then I will be happy. We’ll see in a few hours’ time. The team done an excellent job in trying to get as many parts here as possible, things to fix those issues and those problems. But to a certain extent we don’t know how well they are going to work. We literally have to put the parts on the car  and go out and drive with them for the first time to understand just how good they are, whether it’s enough or too much. Obviously preferably on the side of too much and we come back and make modifications from there. There could be a chance of either. It could be a perfect race where there are no issues and of course that’s an ideal world and there could be a race where we still have to manage many things. Personally and for the whole team we don’t really know yet and we will have to see when we go out on track. No. Max said it will, tyres and weight and everything is the biggest change. Apart from that it feels like a fresh start, there are so many new things around, things you have to work with. In terms of racing, probably we’re going to be racing against Mick a bit more this year. I’m sure that will be a good thing for him. Haas are looking strong, so we are probably racing a few more cars, which is just going to make it more entertaining and tougher for everyone else. Biggest challenges I think, still some of the unknowns with the racing, Like Zhou said, what the slipstream is going to be like, how the DRS it going to work in the slipstream. Size, the lack of visibility in the cars this year comparing to last year and so on. So racing, and knowing where the front wing is an everything. It’s going to be slightly different. Probably the race on Sunday is going to be the first time we really get to experience all of those things… but also with this car and how it works, the characteristics of it. There’s many different tracks where it’s going to feel very different, so until we get to Monaco, or Singapore, the street circuits, we’re not going to be able to learn anything or know what to expect too much, until we get there. In terms of being on top of the car, it’s hard to say just yet and it could be a few races, it could be many more races. Because things are going to be changing. There’s many new things which are going to come in future races. Things you can’t necessarily prepare for in Bahrain, in Barcelona, so early on. I completely agree with Max. I met him yesterday briefly and of course we’ll meet him again in the drivers’ briefing later. Don’t know. Not too sure how it’s going to work just yet. Of course, if there’s consistency, that’s the main thing we want as drivers, then it doesn’t really matter how many how many people there are. As long as there is consistency through the season, I’ll be happy.",Bahrain,friday,McLaren
Mick Schumacher,"I think it’s a quite difficult question to answer really. Personally, I think it shouldn’t be the case just because COVID is still apparent and people still have very hard symptoms with it, although maybe Omicron is a bit easier to deal with, and there are still people that are at risk, so I don’t want to be the person who puts those people at risk because I want to race. I think we have to think globally and we have to try to get it under control and by doing that I think we should minimise the contact with people who are positive. I think that probably… that’s in the past. It’s good to know the results and analysis but essentially we have to look to the future and obviously try to not repeat something like it. I don’t understand the question properly I guess. Drop out of points, reduction of points if you miss a race? Oh OK, so you can decide if you want to lose a race or not. No, we had that in the past in junior categories and honestly it wasn’t great. As everybody else said, no, I guess. It can stay as it is. I guess you see the cars are new so it feels like a new era but I guess in terms of driving and stuff, as Charles just said, there is still stuff we will learn across this year. I think hopefully if we get to fight closer that will obviously be great and hopefully the teams will stay closer or as close as they were in testing now. We will see. Every team seems to have their little issues here and there. I think it’s a matter of probably a few races in that we’ll need to really sort these out –  but I guess there are some fundamental problems right now, which are obviously bouncing, which I expect to be part of this season across. I guess there is still something to be worked on and I’m sure that teams are working on it quite hard for next year. Generally, I guess that I wouldn’t know how many races we’ll need for the other problems, but definitely bouncing will stay. I guess as you just said, it will probably make some days earlier and unfortunately the Thursday will be anyways packed with media. It is interesting. I guess it does help at times but yeah, we’ll find out across the season, if it’s any better or not. I’m not sure, I think I have met him in my junior years, so I guess I have been working with him before but yeah, I guess, as everybody has said, it’s just about consistency and that every weekend is the same, basically, on the rules side.",Bahrain,friday,Haas
Daniel Ricciardo,"I’m good, thank you. Yeah. Quite a few people have said welcome back, but I think the guy to my right (KM) is more of a welcome back. There’s two welcome backs here. Definitely knocked me about for a bit but the last few days have got significantly better each day. Feeling myself again. Which is good. I guess time will tell, but I was still following what I could and trying to keep up with it. I mean yeah, for sure I missed some seat time but, y’know, I felt we left the Barcelona test in a good place and I personally felt comfortable after that test. I felt like we got a lot of laps done, so yes, not ideal missing the Bahrain test, but I still carry a good feeling in the car from Barcelona, and see where that takes me today and the rest of the weekend. Yeah, I feel OK. It’s the first time I got Covid and it’s nothing new now to the rest of the world, I think most people have had it and you do hear of varying effects and, whether they’re long lasting or not. Obviously time will tell. I was here, all day yesterday, obviously doing the media day and we had pretty much a full schedule and I felt OK at the end of the day, and energy was fine, so that’s like the first small test, which would seem OK. I don’t foresee any hurdles but of course, we’ll see what happens. But I do feel prepared. And even though I missed the Bahrain test, I caught up on a tonne of rest, so I’m… yeah… where’s a negative, there’s a positive, and we come in pretty fresh now. Fortunate I’ve been doing his sport quite a few years, we have a couple of hours today to get up to speed and I expect to do that. yeah, we have to see how it goes. I know pretty much every day at the test there was modifications happening, and trying to improve it. I know Day Three there was a good set of progress made, and I kept in touch as well with Lando and he was giving me the feedback as well. And then, since then yeah, we have some modifications to trial today. So, I think we’re in a, let’s say, confident place but will there still be some management? Let’s see. Probably get into some more long runs, I guess, later today and probably trial that this evening. Can you repeat the question? I’m just kidding. I agree. Whoever scores more points! I can’t predict where we’ll be at the end of the year. I’d love to obviously say myself,  you know that myself and McLaren really get on top of these new cars and we gel and we win a ton of races and win the championship. I think today I do think that Red Bull and Ferrari are probably the favourites coming into race one here in Bahrain but will that be the trend for the whole season? I’m not really sure. Let’s say that over the next 48 hours probably these guys were the favourites but over the course of the season I’d like to think myself and McLaren can put our name in that mix. I tried to give you quite a bit but I thought… Yeah. It’s a good question. Yeah, I’d like to kind of think that if you feel like healthy, strong, fit and I don’t know if it’s whether you need to like pass a little fitness or some kind of test to show that you’re in condition to race then maybe that’s enough moving forward but yeah, to be honest it’s the first time I’ve answered a… first time I’ve really thought about it. Yeah, that’s the thing, so I was definitely in a pretty tough place so I would have struggled. Yep, I would have struggled. I was pretty knocked out from it and that’s the thing, so I think it’s really obviously case by case and if you feel like you can do it then yeah, maybe show some kind of little fitness test and prove it but I would have struggled a week ago. I think most has been said. Of course in my head I want to move on and open everything up and do that and for sure at times you think that yeah, it’s kind of past but then obviously I was reminded a week ago that it can still come and bite you so yeah, with that said, I would still obviously love us to progress through it and yeah, make some changes over time if it seems like the right time to… I don’t know if it’s remove masks but just kind of free it up a little but then yeah, again it’s up to your own kind of discretion if you want to wear a mask and take caution and then do that. Yeah, like on a place, I think I’ll continue to wear a mask for even ten years after Covid, probably just a new normal now. I haven’t face-to-face yet met but via video yes. I think, let’s say I’m happy with the approach of the rotation and the additional support so again we have to see how the year pans out and after12 months we can assess if it was a good move but sitting here today, I’m happy with the direction they’re going.
VB: Also haven’t met him yet and yeah, happy with alternating the race directors. I think there’s no issue as long as they obviously communicate well and both are always in the loop with whatever happens so let’s see how it goes in the first three events. No issues from my side. Yes, so your beard’s getting more majestic each time I see you! You’ve really got a good thing going there Matt! So yeah, as much as obviously, myself, I would hate to miss an event, if a replacement was Oscar, I think that would be… you know, I would welcome very much welcome him as a replacement. Yeah, he’s obviously had a phenomenal last three seasons, winning every championship he competed in. Obviously this season he’s probably not competing or at least, not that I know of for now but if he gets an opportunity then at least it’s one that everyone would say is a deserved one.",Bahrain,friday,McLaren
Kevin Magnussen,"I don’t know. I mean, I’m just excited, surprised. I didn’t expect to be starting this season, of course, and I got the call, a little more than a week ago, before that I was on holiday in Miami, with my friends, not expecting to do anything like this. So, just so thankful. No matter how you get to Formula 1, it’s such a massive opportunity, and, in this way, it just feels crazy. I just can’t wait to get started. We’ll see. In the test it felt fine. It didn’t feel like I’d been out for 15 months; it felt like I’d been out just in a normal off-season. The car’s a little different, so it didn’t feel exactly the same, but I didn’t feel like… it’s not like I’ve not been driving race cars for a whole year. It’s just I haven’t been driving Formula 1 cars. My neck especially was not up to it, but that will come back very quickly, and just, as I said, I can’t wait to get started. Nothing to add. Whether I would be able to race with Covid? I don’t know, I’ve never had it, so no idea. Well, first, I was following Formula 1 last year and it wasn’t good to see Haas in the state that they were but I understood it was already the case when I was there in 2020 that they had shifted focus to this new car and so it kind of made sense that they were in the state that they were. It was almost like a decision, it wasn’t a decision that they made so obviously that’s good for the situation I’m in, I’m in this car that they’ve been focusing on so much now and hopefully that will go well. On the other question, of course I was aware of the situation in Ukraine. I saw on the news that Nikita had lost his drive and you know, I thought that made sense from a political point of view. Of course I would love not to be back in this seat because of the situation in Ukraine, I would love it to be whatever odd the situation, there wasn’t a tragic one that this one is but that’s the opportunity I was given and of course no matter what, I’m a racing driver and I love the opportunity that I’ve been given and I’m going to make the best of it, despite the tragic reason for it. Personally I’m not too worried about getting Covid from a health perspective. What I’m worried about is getting it and missing a race, that’s really my biggest worry about it. And as has been said, if we could do the race with it and just be isolated and not expose the team, I would be happy with that. I can understand if people… you know people have families and maybe somebody in their family is not good from a health perspective and wouldn’t want to have it, I can understand if you couldn’t really put that on your surroundings but you could be isolated as a Formula 1 driver and get through a race weekend alone, remotely.",Bahrain,friday,Haas
Sergio Pérez,"I think we have a good base car, which is always important but we also know that it’s so important how much you can improve throughout the season on these new regulations, so I think that will be the key. But, I have to say, it was so impressive to see the amount of work the team has done over the winter, back in the factory at Milton Keynes. We just put the new package on the car and straight away it works. We didn’t have to do any install or anything like that and it worked. So that’s definitely very positive and it just shows the amount of work the team has done, so yeah, big credit to everyone back home in Milton Keynes, and hopefully we can start the season with the right foot. I feel a lot more comfortable, just knowing the team, understanding the Red Bull philosophy in regard to the car, I think, although these cars are very different, it gives you a very good platform, and I’ve got a very good baseline, towards the end of last season, things went a lot better, so I look forward to start our new year with good results. I agree a thousand per cent with these two. I think it would be important to learn from it but also it would be very important to move on. I think the race is on Sunday. We have 22 races so there is no point to start racing each other right now so we just have to wait and see, be patient and we will have a bit of an idea after Sunday but it’s going to be such a long year, development will be the key to it so I think we are not too far away so let’s be patient and see. Covid has evolved so much, you know, that I think the best judge would be ourselves, to know, like Daniel says, probably he wouldn’t be able to race but maybe there are other people or other drivers who get Covid and feels OK. You see what some countries, as well, you  know, it feels like the world is fully open but Formula 1 is very restrictive with the Covid things, so I think we should leave it up to the driver to decide, you know. I think we have all raced once or less feeling really bad healthwise and we are the judge as to say OK, we can race the way we are at the moment, or we can simply not so yeah, if the driver feels comfortable to race like that, I wouldn’t think it’s a problem, you know. The world seems to have moved up from it. Yeah, I think take us back to my point, we are exposed to… I mean Formula 1 has moved up in this regard. The whole world has moved on. But the drivers are still limited and if we get it then we are not able to work but at the same time we are exposed to people, we are exposed to a lot of media, a lot of fans so I think the world has moved on and I think as Formula 1 we should discuss how we can also move on. I think Carlos mentioned a very good point that our sport it can allow the driver if he’s feeling comfortable to perform at this work. You see that some countries have stopped testing, they’ve stopped everything probably, at the other extreme but as a sport, yeah, we just have figure it out how we can make it useful for everyone because at the moment, you cannot see the gaps around us.",Bahrain,friday,Red Bull
Valtteri Bottas,"Things are going good. There’s still work to do, for sure. We’re now taking the first proper step with a team, working together, which is the first race weekend and testing we did have some troubles and I would say the reliability concerns we’ve had through the testing have been the number one topic and priority for this first race. But yeah, I’ve enjoyed it and now it’s time to see where we are, at this point of the season, and then hopefully from there hopefully the only way is up. That’s the target. I feel it has potential. When it is working fine and running smoothly and we got to go a bit deeper into the setup work, it started to feel good, I really started to enjoy the car, both in high fuel and with a little bit less fuel, so the potential is there, no doubt, we’ve just got to make sure we keep on unlocking it throughout the season. I think Carlos said pretty much everything. It’s time to move on but I’m definitely keen to see the full report and all the details and make sure the learnings have been made. That is the main thing. I also feel like it should be a call for the driver. I would vote for yes, should be allowed but only in a way that it can be made sure that there’s no risk of spreading it further so I think that maybe then for someone who has Covid there should definitely be extra protocols to make sure that other team members get affected, because obviously with every person the symptoms can be different, for some less risky, for some more risky so I think that’s the question mark. I think it’s good to see that we are starting to live with it, in a way, but obviously it’s still around and I think in the end it’s a lot about common sense and at least me, I’ve been advised by the team that always when you’re in close contact with people wear a mask, there’s no harm in doing that. Only concern for me, like today, arriving at the paddock there was quite a lot of fans who were taking selfies and none of them were wearing masks and they get pretty close and then I feel uncomfortable so for sure I take my distance but it’s a lot of common sense. In the end, we need to live with it but still be sensible in a way.",Bahrain,friday,Alfa Romeo
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, relatively confident knowing that testing has been really smooth for us. We managed to do six total days with barely any issues, and we managed to learn everything we could from the car. There’s still already things that we need to work on, that we spotted on data and on driver feedback that we wanted to develop further forward into the season and yeah, I think it gives us a good base coming into the first race. Normally at the first race you want to keep it clean, and you want to make sure you have the full quali and full race experience in order to build on it for the rest of the year. It’s going to be a 23-race season and it’s important in the first  race to avoid anything crazy and learn from the car as much as you can. At the same time, if there’s any opportunity to go for it, I will obviously go for it – but let’s see. Yeah, I’m obviously interested in seeing what comes out of it and what we have learned as a sport and what changes are going to be applied to make sure that such things aren’t repeated again but at the same time, I think it’s time to… as soon as it comes out and as soon as it’s analysed and read by everyone, it’s time to move on. We are in March 2022 and we are still talking about December 2021 and I think as a sport it’s also time to… whatever comes out of that meeting, learn from it, apply the lessons learned and move on and never talk about it too much again because if not we’re just going to spend too much time in the past. I think we are not too far away from each other and development is going to be king this year and it’s going to be more how it finishes more than how it starts now. I don’t know, we’ve waited three months to know where everyone is going to be. We’re going to wait 24 more hours now to see who’s going to be in front in qualifying and in the race, so let’s just wait a bit more. Yeah, picking up from where Valtteri left, I think it’s… if there is a sport that I think that you can race without… or compete without spreading the virus too much or at least zero I think it is Formula 1 I think you could do all the meetings back in your hotel room, arrive 15 minutes before the session with your suit and your helmet on, jump in the car and go. Personally, I feel like if I get Covid and you’re in the middle of a championship fight or a very important thing I would struggle to accept missing a race and if I’m feeling well and I’m feeling perfectly fit, if I am feeling bad I would be the first one to raise my hand and say I cannot race and the third driver needs to jump in. But I think it’s an interesting case that we should investigate because I think that our sport gives us that opportunity to maybe be a bit more protected and less spread and yeah, I think it should be up to the driver to decide. I did feel, for a bit, like we were moving on a bit and then suddenly, obviously, Daniel positive case and Sebastian’s yesterday raised the alarms again and all of a sudden you need to kind of react, wake up again and go back to two years ago because you see that Covid is still around us and is still a possibility. It’s like it’s never really leaving us. You start to feel like you’re getting out of the thing and then suddenly there’s always a positive case near to you and the alarms ringing and it’s a pain, I’m not going to lie, it’s for me two years in a row like this, it’s becoming tiring and it’s becoming like it’s never ending but at the same time, what can you do? You put on your mask and you keep going with your life and try not to get it like in the last few days, so whatever. I just hope we can keep moving on as Checo was mentioning before and little by little with the whole paddock vaccinated we can little by little as Checo was mentioning we can keep moving on.",Bahrain,friday,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"I don’t know. I think no one knows. At the moment I think testing has been up and down for everyone. I think we had good days, especially the last two here in Bahrain. We made a lot of progress on the car and we are happy with how we approach race one. Tomorrow in qualifying I guess we will discover what is the performance of everybody and then move on. The season is going to be long – 22 races – a lot of development on the cars, so it is not how you start tomorrow, it is how you make progress in the first two or three months of the season. Yeah, we are working flat out and the team is very optimistic about this. I think they are definitely different. As we spoke about last week as well, the cars are heavier and every driver will tell you a faster car or a lighter car will feel a little bit better to drive. It’s the way it is and how racing should be. But on the other hand these cars are very safe and sustainability has been also a big topic in the last few years in Formula 1, so it’s the world is going and we are happy to embrace that as well. I don’t know, I mean, nobody knows at the moment where are all the teams in terms of performance you are only happy when you are fighting for pole position and as we have said many times you know we are entered in this new era of Formula 1 where all the teams have more or less the same possibilities, the budget cap, so it’s up to us to build the fastest car and maybe we cannot achieve that in this very first year, there are a lot of things going on in the team just to make sure that we are a contender for the future and it’s what Alpine wants as well, so you know, we will work day and night until we reach that. Yeah, probably the slow speed are the corners that these cars they struggle a little bit more because of the weight and also how the aerodynamics work this year but I think here in Bahrain we saw also last year that the winter was difficult for everyone. It’s a track that exposes all the weaknesses in the slow-speed corners and the heat and things like that. In Barcelona it was not that bad, the last sector for example, a few weeks ago, so we have to wait and see, to judge exactly what are the limitations on these cars. But yeah, the weight of the car is the biggest thing we felt driving. No, I don’t think we need to read anything. It’s done, it’s over already and there are many race direction decision we can understand and we cannot understand sometimes and always we move on and this time is no different. I don’t know. I honestly don’t care. And I think, as I said, you know, it was it what it was, right or wrong and in that moment the race direction felt right and over the season you know in 21 races there are always decision we could agree or maybe we don’t agree and we never had to study anything in detail, so we have different rules this year for safety car and for lapped cars and things like that. We move on and let’s see this year, track limits are different, so there is the normal evolution in the sport. No, I’m not concerned. Yeah, there were a couple of positives in these last two weeks but I think the world is moving on as well and we respect the countries’ restrictions when we go racing there and every team has its own internal policy as well. We take care of ourselves and hopefully we don’t see many cases during the year. No impact, I think. It’s the white line for everybody. It’s like in football. There is an area that you cannot touch the ball with the hand, that is how you referee and it is the same for everyone. We just need a referee that applies the rule.",Bahrain,friday,Alpine
Nicholas Latifi,"I think the testing had its ups and downs. I think Barcelona was definitely a bit smoother obviously. Having to miss day two of the Bahrain test was not ideal and it did set us back a little bit, but we weren’t the only team that had quite big issues. It was clear up and down the paddock, across both test, that lots of teams were having to set out an a.m. or p.m. session for various reasons. I think definitely here in Bahrain some of the, let’s say, limitations were highlighted a bit more. Like I was saying coming into the test that was always to be expected. The car always feels much better testing in very cool temperatures in Barcelona than when you come here. I think we are still going to have a lot of work to do, but as Fernando said, and as I have been saying, it’s not about how you start in race one, it’s going to be a long season of 23 (sic) races and that development and how we react as a team to what we see once we finally find out what the pecking order is, I think that’s going to be key - how we react. I am excited to start the season now. To be honest, it’s very difficult to say, especially with the testing that we did miss. We were one of the teams that wasn’t able to do the softer compound runs and the cooler track conditions and what not. Too early to tell but I think we are probably not exactly where we want to be right now, but as I say, it’s going to be a long season. To be honest, nothing more to add from what the three previous guys have said. I echo their sentiment and agree. From my side I don’t think I’m any more or less worried than I have been in previous years. I guess like Fernando said, the world is moving on and just learning to live with COVID. It’s more just a kind of normal illness but I guess for us in particular the penalty is still the same as testing positive two years ago, which is missing a race or potentially two races depending on when you get it. In that sense, from my side at least, I’m still obviously being careful when I can. Obviously the difference this year compared to the previous years in terms of the general feeling around the world, yeah, for sure it feels more relaxed. Testing is less and less. It’s still something we have to be aware of.
LS: We are seeing the world move forward. We’re adapting to the world we live in now and I still think it’s important to be responsible when you around elderly people, grandparents, all these things I think are separate, that’s everyone’s responsibility to be around elderly people but as Formula 1, as a sport, as a world we have to move on and live our lives. We’re starting to see that all over the world now.",Bahrain,friday,Williams
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, it’s definitely not ideal for the team. But we carry on doing what we do, yeah, I mean, at this stage it’s all just about learning and improving the car as much as possible and I’ll be doing that as best I can with the team. Yeah, I think Bahrain was good. We got a lot of laps and we got some low fuel runs on the softer tyres, the softer compounds, we got some of those runs done. We got some high fuel, long-run simulations done and we definitely got a good understanding about the strengths and weaknesses of our car areas we have to work on and improve on. But it’s definitely a big learning curve with these new regulations. Going forward it’s all about understanding how to get more out of the car and developing the car as much as possible every race. Yeah, I think there needs to be absolute consistency, clarity on the rules. What happened was unacceptable and yeah, we need to have consistency everywhere we go. I’ve had it twice. She likes me. Yeah, you know what, I think we know so much about the virus now, I think there are ways of being very cautious and responsible, you know, whilst having COVID and still competing. I think there are ways of being, isolating yourself, putting your helmet on in your room and minimising completely contact with everyone. There are ways to do that. I do think I could compete with it. Yes, I was just a little cold when I had it and you know I think the main thing is really like I said earlier I think it’s watching out and being responsible around elderly people and I think that that is everyone’s responsibility when they go visit their grandparents or older people. Get tested, wear your mask, be very safe and be responsible. But I think there comes a point where we can’t stop the rest of our lives and we have to continue living and you know find a balance where we have some normality in our world.",Bahrain,friday,Aston Martin
Pierre Gasly,"Well, I do hope we’ve got that car. It’s been a great year last year and it’s been great to see the team evolving over the last few years. I joined Toro Rosso in 2017 and I have seen every year how the team steeped up their game and everything became more professional and I’m really happy with the level they are performing at now. It’s a new year, a new regulation, a new car. It’s a lot of unknowns but we are ready. We are ready to give it everything and hopefully we can do as well or even better than last year. It never goes as smooth as you’d like but for sure you always come into a new season hoping for the car to be very amazing and then you discover along the way you obviously have work to do but I think it’s the same thing for everyone. We know what we want to achieve. We know what we have got to work on. No idea at the moment where we stand in the rankings compared to other guys but it’s part of the game on Saturday. Everyone is going to go full beans and we will see where are and work from there. Yeah, I echo George’s comment. We need transparency and we need clarity, to know what we expect for the future. What’s done is done. Whether it was the right thing or the wrong thing, it is important for us drivers to know, going forward, how these situations are going to be treated and yeah, to know what to expect, so the sooner we can get this information the better. I agree with everything that has been said. I think we obviously have to be responsible but I’m really happy to see that things are moving forwards for the better and looking forward to see all your beautiful faces soon.
GR: Not a lot more to add, I think. I trust in F1 and the FIA’s decision. I think we all know a huge amount more about the virus and washing hands, being outdoors is a bit easier than for everybody to not contract the virus and so I think you have just got to be responsible. But equally, time is moving and if governments feel that it is safe to do so then they’re the experts. Yes, I think physically clearly there was no problem. I got tested after having done like an 18km run and I never felt as good as it did at the time and I was kind of in shock when I got the news and after that I was still feeling fine. Different to Lance, I haven’t had any symptoms at all and obviously physically it would not have been any problem. You have to be responsible. At the end of the day scientists and doctors if they believe that there would not be any problem then I think we should go ahead because what you don’t want, as a driver I don’t want my championship to be impacted by this virus. I think it has been hard enough over the past two years. When you see Seb’s situation, missing the first race of the season, it might affect his final position at the end of the year and you don’t want the championship to be decided on whether he missed a race or not if he was tested positive. Yeah, it’s a tricky one but as Lance said, now we have learned so much more about that virus, how to be more careful and cautious about it and I am sure there will be ways to still race as long as everybody is safe and everybody is comfortable with it.",Bahrain,friday,AlphaTauri
George Russell,"I think when you get to qualifying and you sit in the car everything feels the same, it doesn’t matter if you’re sitting in a silver car, a black car, a blue car, your objective as a driver is always the same and these external factors almost disappear. Obviously it’s a real privilege and a special feeling to be part of such an incredible team but we’re here to make the car go as fast as possible. I’m here to try to make myself go as fast as possible. I feel ready. I feel in a good spot. I’m feeling relaxed and I’m just looking forward to driving this afternoon. My goal is to try to make the car go faster. We know we are not quite where we want to be. I think it’s clearly visible when you see it on the television that we are bouncing around a lot, especially compared to our main rivals, and that’s what we need to get on top of. The team have been working day and night since the tests to try to resolve some of these issues to bring some more performance. I believe there is potential in our car somewhere. Whether we are going to be able to reach that potential this weekend or whether it is going to be a few races down the line I’m not too sure but fortunately the races don’t come thick and fast at the start of the season, as the probably do from race six onwards. I feel really comfortable within the team to be honest. I think it’s helped being part of the junior programme for so long, seeing how the team operates, knowing all of the team members, so it doesn’t feel like I’ve joined a new team, it feels like I’ve returned from a couple of years at Williams, as I spent two or three years previously, and I think what’s great so far working with Lewis is that we have really got the same feedback, we are commenting on the same limitations, we are pushing in the same direction and I think we both recognise that the competition isn’t with each other, our competition is with Red Bull, with Ferrari, with McLaren and we need to work together to get on top of the issued we face. We are definitely being vocal about it because we are seeing different issues compared to what you would normally expect, mainly with this bouncing issue we are facing. You obviously see it in the data but what we feel under our bottom is probably the best sense of what you’ve got on the car. We are really working as hard as we can to improve that. I think it’s very important to be published as soon as possible. Obviously the events that unfolded in Abu Dhabi were not to the standards that all of us expect, all of us Formula 1 fans, drivers, teams. Clarity is needed and it’s important that the issue that faces… it was in the past and we obviously do need to move on but it can’t just be swept under the carpet, so we need to see the outcome. I think it’s… you know Netflix is so important for all of us in Formula 1. We have seen the change the sport has had for the better over these years, the increased fan interaction, new people coming into the sport. People have been very vocal about it being dramatized a little bit but at the end of the day you always want to show the best light of your sport and your story as in any documentary that there is. Netflix is unique and as long as it’s having a positive impact on Formula 1 I think there’s no real issue. I don’t think I will be going to Hollywood anytime soon. I think fighting for victories and winning on merit are two different things. We saw last year Lewis and Mercedes won the race but they qualified four tenths of a second behind Red Bull and Max. They were far behind the Red Bull but they did things right on the day and they came away with a victory, so on merit I totally stand by what Lewis said. I think we aren’t where we would want to be. We are continuously trying things but we don’t have a silver bullet at the moment that we thing is absolutely going to clear our problems but equally we don’t know but the thing we might try this afternoon might just be the thing that needs to be done to solve the issue or this might another three, four, five months of work to truly understand this and it’s always difficult during practice sessions, so you can’t try a million things at once, you have to do it analytically. Fingers crossed we get it right sooner rather than later but even so I think we will be in the mix and there’s no reason why, if we do everything right, get the strategy right, make a good start, that we couldn’t hold off a faster car.",Bahrain,friday,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"As a team, it was relatively smooth. It wasn’t smooth for me, or plenty of us drivers, it wasn’t necessarily smooth out there but it’s… yeah, it was obviously a surprise for us as a sport to see the changes to the car and the effects of the changes. We’re discovering bit-by-bit the limitations of our car and know that we have a lot of work to do. I don’t expect that we’ve made a huge amount of progress. The car naturally was fresher. As you come into a test you have a new engine, you have new components but it is still the car from last week. We have have learnt a lot from the week of testing here and I hope that we have taken some sort of step forward in terms of… through that understanding in terms of where we position the car – but we’ll find out. There was no way I could have raced when I had it. I was very, very sick. And even when I came back, just on the tail end of it, I barely made it through the race. I just actually messaged Seb because it is sad not to see him here. I hope that he is OK. I know Daniel was heavily affected by it. It is strange that… Obviously the world is getting more and more used to having it and you less and less of it on the news. Actually I never see any of it on the news anymore, but it is still around us and I think we will still need to take precautions, continue to wear masks and continue to stay safe and keep others safe. If we all stop wearing our masks and everyone in the garage gets it, everyone is going to be sick and it will affect people differently. Some people don’t even know they have it and some people get really ill. So, it’s better just not to take the risk for now and also I think just as a sport and how we appear in terms of the message we are sending people out there I think it’s important that we continue to keep our masks. I think it’s important that, as a sport, that we’re transparent. I had a good meeting with Mohammed last night who agreed that that’s the direction that we should take as a sport and so (I’m) looking forward to seeing it come out and for people to know that this sport is transparent and we are learning from what’s happened in the past and will make improvements moving forward. Ah, no to both of those. That’s not my psyche, that’s not our approach this season. I’m just approaching the season, trying to be the best that I can be. I want to see if there’s a way I can come… somehow raise my game, drive at least how I was at the end of last season and just that collaboration with the team, it’s just going to be lots and lots of hurdles along the way, but I love that and yeah, I don’t have that viewpoint, just trying to be the best driver I can be this year. I think there’s still more that I can do both in and out of the car. I still have a lot of work to do on the diversity front here as a sport, so I will continue to fight for that too. Nothing’s changed at the moment. I think we’ve learned a lot, obviously, through the test as everyone will have and I really… I’m hoping that my guys have come with some sort of solution going into this weekend and when I get in the car today, it feels better but I know there’s not a huge change in such a short space of time so we will still most likely have some of the problems that we had last week. Mentally, I think it’s just about trying to make sure you’re extracting everything in every other area and all I can do is control how I’m performing in the car and so yeah, just trying to be positive, know that we’ll work together at a team. It is the best team and I’m very grateful for the group of people that I have behind me, confident that we can make our way through it somehow. Is it important I do what? I don’t really… I don’t hold any grudge, I don’t have any baggage that I’m carrying into this season. I think it is important to let go of whatever. All I can do is control what’s… try to shape what’s up ahead of me. I know I can’t change the past, but will work as hard as I can with the FIA, with the teams in the sport to make sure that things are done better moving forwards and as I said, we welcome the changes that they have proposed. We hope that it works better for everyone. I think what’s important is clarity, that the rules are applied fairly for everyone and consistently, that’s all we ask for as drivers. Yeah, I think a lot different. I think every year you’re evolving not only as a human but also as a driver and I think your preparation, trying to find that balance outside of work, as inside of work is always adjusting. I think I would say (I’m) just much better at managing my time today and given that I have been here so long, there’s obviously the knowledge that you have that you carry with you. Also, I’ve been with this team for ten years so there’s a great rapport within the team. I know what we can and can’t do. If I’m honest, there’s nothing that I don’t believe we can overcome, so yeah, we’ve got some challenges, it’s not great, but we’ll work through it. I haven’t seen the drawing yet but each year I receive letters from those that are suffering and all I can do is try my hardest to empathise with those who face these challenges and have these tragic stories to tell. I think the weight of change really needs to be put on the governments and those that are in power and I think that’s why we’ve got to continue to utilise the platforms we have when we arrive in these countries as well, make sure we’re holding serious conversations about what is happening there. I think, as drivers, we have platforms to try to help raise awareness for those, but there are amazing organisations out there on the ground that are fighting for human rights and I support those. But there’s a lot of work to do. The world is a mess and yeah, we see more displacement of refugees than ever before, not only in Ukraine but in Syria, in Yemen, I think it needs to be a priority for all of us to come together and really try to push for change, long-lasting change. What was the first one? I think none of us have really had the time, I think, over this… it’s been flat-out. I don’t know if the other drivers have yet met him but hopefully in time we will. I met Mohammed a long long time ago through an event that we had ten years ago or something like that in Dubai, so it’s good to see him in the position he’s in, again it adds to that diversity challenge that we’re trying to overcome. What was the other part of the question? We’ve not spoken about the VAR stuff, we’ve not spoken about that. I don’t know any further about that part. And there will be some sort of fine re the gala but we’ve worked together to make sure the money will be put together towards youth from under-privileged backgrounds getting into motor sports engineering. It won’t affect involvement in the Netflix series but it is a really exciting part of my life. I’ve started a production company working on creating documentaries and movies. I have a movie that I’m working on which is also super-exciting. The documentary, yeah, it’s a challenge; of course you want it to be great. There’s lots of great documentaries out there and lots of not-so-great documentaries out there but I think the ultimate goal of the documentary is really to explain the story and hopefully to inspire lots of kids out there, lots of even parents, it’s a journey of a family that had a dream to do better and I’m sure there are lots of parents in this room who want the best for their kids and would do absolutely anything they can to create better opportunities for them moving forward and this is what that story is really about. Honestly, when I did see the story on that and I was very moved to… I never in a million years thought that I would ever be able to have that sort of impact on people, particularly in those positions, with just some of them with some incredible stories, fighting against a difficult system. And honestly, I really tried to hold serious conversations in the background to try and improve that system for those that are currently in prison and those that who may face those circumstances in the future and it’s not an easy line to walk and it’s risky, it’s challenging, it’s difficult relationships but for me what’s important is seeing a better future for people and I think we come to these beautiful places and there’s challenges everywhere and no country is perfect but I think we can all do more and so I’m just trying to do as much as I can with the time that I have. I can’t do everything and I can’t do it alone, so I need allies but it’s really, really… honestly it’s amazing to hear of that story. I will be a more aggressive driver this year. You’ll see.",Bahrain,friday,Mercedes
Esteban Ocon,"It’s difficult to give an order exactly what we see, what we’ve seen in testing. What I know is that we had a very good Bahrain test, we had three days trouble-free, completing the programme. I know that we have a few little things here and there to test in the car today, so hopefully that’s going to boost our performance a little bit as well. But yeah, I think we’ll know more about positioning and who’s where today, when everybody’s going to be more on the same plan. Yeah, I like this track a lot that’s for sure. It was on a different version of it back in 2020 but I have great memories from racing here, if it’s in F1, if it’s in junior categories back them, yeah, it’s a lot of fun, there’s a lot of overtaking, there is high degradation, so the overtaking should be nice. There are a lot unknowns of course, if with these cars the race is going to be closer so looking forward to seeing finally what these cars have got. Yeah, I think it’s quite important that we all understand how it’s going to go forward. Obviously I’m happy to see that it’s already very clear, on track limits, what’s going to be the limit which is going to be the white line. Of course we’re going to have an extra meeting tonight to discuss about all that but so far I think there are positive things coming along.",Bahrain,friday,Alpine
Alex Albon,"Good. Obviously the team have made me feel very welcome and we’ve hit the ground running I feel like. Obviously I’ve had a year out, so a lot to think about, a lot on my mind and you know the team are clearly on the rise and they’re pushing on. They had a great year last year and whilst joining the team I have been able to at least put some of my input and just try to help the team move forward. I don’t really have anything else to add, same as what these guys have said. Transparency is good.",Bahrain,friday,Williams
Yuki Tsunoda,"Of course aim for the points. We don’t know the exact position we are in now, so just focus on what we have to do. Of course it [would be] good to score points but we will see. We’ll just focus on what we have to do to develop the car and also even we end up in a bad way or a good way it will good to have a baseline for the future to develop the car as much as possible. I have good memories of last year, like you said, scoring points first time in a race, so I will push as much as possible and we will see what will happen. Yeah, same.",Bahrain,friday,AlphaTauri
