Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I knew I had to be very aggressive. So I knew that in lap one, I had to take all the risks possible in order to gain as many places as possible, to then be in a good position for the rest of the race, this achieved. But then, unfortunately, we were just starting too far back to do anything better than what we've done today. I think we've done the maximum. It hurts, obviously, because the season was so close until the end. It was a hard hit on Friday when we knew we had the penalty. We still gave it all and we just came short of our goal, which is a shame. But at the end, we've tried everything. Yeah, I really hope so. I mean, if we look at our first part of the year, we were nowhere near being in the fight for the Constructors’. Then the second part of the season was really good and the team has done an incredible job. I think Carlos and I have done a really good job as well together. So, yeah, we ended strong, and I'm sure that next year we’ll hopefully start as strong as what we have ended this year. Yeah, of course. I mean, Lewis has achieved so much in the sport and it will be a big motivation. But obviously for now, it's more thinking about the past year and the past years I've done with Carlos. We've had an amazing relationship. We've pushed each other. I really hoped that we could finish these four years together with a Constructors’ title. We both gave it all. It wasn't enough. So obviously now the disappointment is here. And yeah, now I will have four or five days to reset and start thinking about next year then. Thank you very much. No, not really. I mean, again, I'm, of course, really happy about the race. But the disappointment is a lot bigger. You don't win or lose a chairmanship in the last race. But obviously, it's over the course of the season and after every single race. And McLaren has just done a better job than us. And congratulations to them. But it obviously hurts when you get to the last race. You know there's an opportunity. It was a very difficult weekend, obviously, already with the penalty on Friday. It was never going to be easy. But after such a good first lap, the hopes were high. And yeah, we just came short of our dream, which was to win the Constructors’. So it hurts. I don't know. Maybe in Formula 2, I've had a few good first laps. But in F1, I think it's definitely the best first lap I've had. I mean, yesterday, I think P4 was probably the best, which would have been P14 or P15. Then you never know what happens by starting P15, we'll have had won anyway 11 positions? I think it's a long shot to say that. So yeah, all in all, I think my first lap recovered basically everything that we've had since the beginning of the weekend. So I don't have any regrets. I'm very happy because I think the first part of the season wasn't easy. We were definitely not the fastest car. We were actually struggling for performance. The second part of the season, we've done an incredible job, mostly for improving the car in terms of pace. We've picked up a lot of pace. We were a lot closer to the guys in front, and actually on some races we were probably the fastest car and this is thanks to the team in Maranello, thanks to Carlos, thanks to me and the team back at the track as well to have done such a great job with the new upgrades. But I think the highlight of this season has definitely been the execution. Because to be fighting for the Constructors’ at the end of the year until the very last race, if you look at the performance we've had in the first part of the year, And that's where I think we've done a particularly good job. So on that, I'm very proud. Yeah, I think we've had two seasons where we're basically fighting for the championship. Obviously, one was not for long enough, which was in 2022. And I think with that, we've grown a lot. I’ve grown a lot as a driver and I think we've grown a lot also as a team, because when it's been such a long time, obviously, the people in the team, most of them have changed. And so for many people, it was also the first time fighting again with Ferrari at the top. So I think it's an important process. But yeah, I think in the last four years, we've taken steps by steps going in the right direction. With Carlos, we've pushed the team into a very good direction. And I think we are in a very good place now. Obviously, we just came short of the ultimate goal this year. But I kind of agree with Lando that momentum is not really a thing. There's been quite a lot of examples on our side where we finished a year strong and then the beginning of the year after we've been struggling, so we really need to stay on it. We've had quite a few examples, and we managed to pinpoint what went wrong in that winter break, that we didn't do quite right, and that we paid the price at the beginning of the season after. And this is probably the experience that is the most helpful in order to start next year in the best possible way. I completely agree. I think Lando and myself are probably the two best persons to speak about it, because we've been sharing the same team with Carlos for many years. And I can tell you, Carlos is so incredibly talented. He's helped me to improve in so many areas, his work ethic, his talent, just everything he brings. The discipline he has, he's been just such an incredible team-mate. And I think if today, I will repeat myself, but if today we have done such a step forward in a year and in these four years, it's a big thanks to Carlos. He's just been extremely quick. And in Formula 1, as Lando said, some things you don't really have explanations for. There's also luck that is involved to be at the right place at the right time and Carlos definitely deserves to be in a top team. But I'm sure that it's just a matter of time before he comes back and joins us to fight for wins. He will give so much to Williams, the way he's so sensitive to every small change and every small feeling there is in the car. I'm pretty sure that already tomorrow they will have a lot of valuable feedback that will help them for next year. But yeah, I'll definitely miss the fights. We've had our moments on track, but that's only because we were fighting so close together and because he's been pushing me all the way. And it's been an absolute pleasure. And of course, in some moments, in the actual moment, in the present moment, there's frustration. But I'm sure that, and actually already now, I'm looking back at those moments. with a lot of positive memories. And I wouldn't be the driver I am today without him as my team-mate in the last four years. So yeah, it's been a really big pleasure and four years that I will be looking back in the most positive way. And I wish him the best. But as I said, I have no doubts that he will be back at the top of the grid, whether it's with Williams by his input or with someone else. But he deserves that. I think everybody knows that. And it's just a matter of time before he comes back.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Obviously, a bit of a bittersweet feeling in the end. V2, I think, was the maximum we could do today, given the pace of Lando in the McLaren. Yeah, I gave it everything, especially the first thing. It looked like we could hang on to them. Then as soon as we put the Hard tyres, they just seemed to be that one or two tenths quicker per lap, like we've seen all weekend. And they just got a bit out of reach. But yeah, congratulations, first of all, to McLaren. They deserve this championship. They’ve been rock solid in the last two-thirds of the championship, and they've been incredible. From our side. I think we can be proud of the effort and the championship we put together. It's been a tough year, but definitely a year where we need to be proud of and, yeah, hopefully be back here soon. Yeah, obviously emotional on the in lap with my engineer talking to me on the radio, Yeah, at the same time, very grateful, you know, to be part of this amazing team for four years. I think I've had the opportunity to win my first races, do my first pole positions, my first podiums. I've proven to myself and to everyone that I can be fighting for race wins and for podiums. If I have the right car and my target is from next year onwards, focus together with Williams to get back to where we belong together. Thank you very much. Yeah, obviously a bit of mixed feelings, I'm not going to lie. I think we all came into this race trying to win the Constructors' Championship and ultimately we did manage to do it. McLaren have put together a very strong weekend. Lando hasn't put a foot wrong all race and all weekend. And in the end, congratulations to them because they deserve it. On my side, I tried to do everything I could to keep within reach of McLaren. Before the race we knew that McLaren might have one or two tenths of pace on us and that was enough, you know, to pull a bit of a gap before the pit stops or during the race to have a bit of a buffer and not to feel too much pressure. I think I had a very strong first stint, managed to keep them within reach and within pressure margins, especially when I was told Charles was coming in a good comeback. Oscar had obviously that incident in lap one, I thought, we might have a bit of a chance, but then little by little it started to fade. When we put on the Hard tyres, like we've seen in many cases this year, the McLaren upped the pace a bit, turn up the pace a bit, and they started pulling away two, three tenths per lap, and that was enough for them to have that safety margin and bring it home. And from our side, I think we did everything we could. Both Charles and I have given absolutely everything this weekend. It hasn't been an easy weekend for me, obviously, knowing it was the last one. But I did the best I could to stay focused and to do the maximum that the car could do today, I think. Strange. A bit emotional, I'm not going to lie. Probably, I would say it was more emotional the last time that I jumped in the car, in the grid. I knew that was obviously going to be my last race with a group of people that I've enjoyed these last four years. The last time that I would jump in a Ferrari car, probably, and I was just feeling emotional. I tried to remind myself to try and enjoy the race as much as possible and to give the absolute maximum for this team. Jumping out of the car, I already had the bittersweet feeling of... Lando just did the snake. A worm? a snake? I don't know what you were there. Where were we? That distracted me. I honestly lost, where were we? Being very honest with you, I don't think so. I think, I'm not going to lie, my last laps, as much as I was pushing like hell for this team and trying to, I was already starting to feel things in the car and trying to say, remember how this feels. because tomorrow and Tuesday I need to remember why is this car quick in this corner and why does it feel good? Because I know probably what I'm going to find tomorrow and Tuesday needs some margin of improvement in the corners that I was feeling the car. So this just sums up that I'm already looking also ahead. I'm extremely motivated for the challenge that I have ahead of me. Today is a day to try and enjoy as much as possible with the team as my last day in red. We still have some days in Maranello coming up, but obviously my competitive mind is already looking forward to Monday and Tuesday and to see how I can make that Williams car faster. It was a very tricky thing to handle because obviously I did a very fast out lap to try and get within DRS or within range of trying to overtake Lando after the pit stop. Also, in case they had a half a second to a second slower pit stop that could put us within reach. And that's why we sent the undercut. Then after he came out in front of me, you go through this thought process of do I push like hell now to get within DRS, but Lando can also push and keep me out of the DRS. And that means I'm going to destroy my tyres and not have a chance at the end of the race of putting him under pressure. Or I save my tyres to try and put them under pressure at the end like I did in the first stint. And so it's very difficult thing to judge with these tyres to use the first three laps to extract the peak of the tyre or to save that to the end of the race. I don't think it would have mattered. I think McLaren and Lando today, with a Hard tyre, they were just one or two tenths quicker. And he could have used that pace whenever he wanted to keep me at bay, you know. Even though on the Medium I really strongly believed we had a chance, little by little with the Hard, it just seemed like it was getting tougher and tougher. And that's where I think the weakness of our car started to also appear and the strengths of the McLaren started to appear again. And it slipped away from us a bit. Yeah, I feel obviously very proud of my time in Ferrari. Proud to have contributed these four years to bring in this team back to where it belongs, that is fighting for world championships. Unfortunately, like Charles said, we didn't manage this year, but I have a feeling that Ferrari now is ready to fight for the world championship next year. And together with Charles, I honestly believe they have a very good chance, and they are, for me, one of the favourites for next year. From my side, I'm proud of the four years, but maybe more proud of this last year. I think this last year was a very tough year mentally and very challenging with the news at the beginning of the year to keep the motivation up, to keep the determination, to keep pushing through the whole year with a 24-race calendar and not letting myself get too deflated at times. I think it's been a big challenge that I think I managed to respond with good strength and determination to finish the year strongly and to finish the year with a few podiums, with a win in Mexico and helping the team to dream about the Constructors' title. We've seen that it was not easy for any other driver that was leaving a team to keep that focus and that motivation up through the whole year. And I managed to do that. And that's what makes me feel good about this year and my lasting of this season. Maybe I already have. And you just don't know. And you haven't seen it. Maybe it was in the helmet. Maybe it was in the in the 10 minutes prior to a race when I was in the car. Maybe it was in the in-lap. Yeah. Maybe you'll never know. I can just tell you that I did get emotional at some point today. I'm not going to tell you exactly when or how. It's a feeling that I save to myself and for my team. And yeah, maybe it's all a bit of acting, and I'm acting like I'm not emotional at all. And I've learned from Brad Pitt that is here this weekend. I don't know. I tell you, I've been emotional. It's just up until today, there was too much of a job to do and too much of a thing to fight for. So your brain doesn't allow you to get emotional because you care more about winning and giving the team a Constructors' Championship than your emotions itself. Let's say, your competitiveness takes over. But today there were moments that I got emotional and luckily you guys didn't get to see it. Yeah, that is a question that I cannot answer. It's impossible to predict the future, impossible to know how long it's going to take me and Williams to be back fighting for podium positions. I think James said it the other day and calmed everyone's expectations, that next year is going to be a tough year and a learning year before we prepare for the change of regulations in ‘26, where I believe the team is investing and the team is preparing to maximise that chance. What I can tell you is that I'm as determined as ever to help that team to be back where it belongs. I personally feel like I belong to be fighting for wins, podiums and top fives in Formula 1. I think I've proven it these last four years as a driver. I think I belong to that. But Williams cannot forget that Williams also belongs to fighting for these top five and podium places. And together with the determination and the strength that I think we're going to show together, the target is to get Williams and myself fighting for those positions in the near future, in the nearest future. How long that's going to take, I cannot tell you. But as I said before, I don't think you guys understand and expect how motivated and how much I'm actually looking forward to that challenge. I know that's one of my qualities, to help a team to perform better and to know which directions to follow. And that actually motivates me, having a full team behind Alex and me pushing all in the same direction to make a historic team like Williams competitive again is. It's a challenge that yeah it's tough to explain but some people don't understand how much i'm actually looking forward to it. I don't think you will. I think it’s better. One less guy to...",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Thank you. It feels incredible. It feels incredible. Not for myself, but before the whole team. The team have done an amazing job this year to come from where we were at the beginning. I'm so proud of everyone. It's been a lovely journey, and to end the season like this is perfect. So just a congrats and a big thank you to everyone in McLaren, everyone in papaya, everyone who supported us this year, because it's been a tough one, but for us to win a Constructors’ after 26 years is pretty special. Yeah, me and Zak already said we're going to get absolutely hammered tonight, so I'm excited. You know, we're going to celebrate. This is a historic moment for the team. They're going to want to celebrate, and I want to celebrate with them, so it's going to be a good night. This is my goal. This is our goal as a team. We want to win the Constructors’. We want to win the Drivers’ next year. I made my mistakes this year, but I've learned a lot, and I've learned a lot from Max and my competitors around me. As much as I'm happy now, I'm excited to get next year going. Yeah, I mean, I'm very, very happy. Just as I'm sure everyone in the team is. Today was a very special day for all of us. It was ours to lose today and I'm sure at certain moments people thought that it was not far away from being lost. You know, two Ferraris up there and Charles doing a great job to get back to the podium. Oscar was super unlucky. He got taken out in Turn 1. So for a minute, my heart was like, ‘oh God, it's not looking as likely’. But if I just kept my head down and kept focused, I knew I could deliver and do what I got to do. That's that, but the bigger picture of us winning a championship for the first time in 26 years, you wouldn't have thought that when you say the name McLaren. It feels wrong to say that they've not won a championship in 25 years (sic). But for me to be part of that, for Oscar to be part of it, is something we're incredibly proud of. And delivering that for the team has put the biggest smile as possible on everyone's face. This is the biggest reward you can give back to everyone who designs the car, builds the car, gets the partners. Everyone has played such a big part, so just proud. Proud is my biggest thing. Of course, I'm happy I finished the season this way, but I'm way more happy for the team than I am for myself. I don't, so... I don't believe in a lot of things, but I think the one thing I've learned this year is probably to believe in myself a bit more. I've certainly not come out on top as often as I would have liked in certain moments as a driver, you know, especially in my fights against Max. As much as it hurts sometimes, I'm probably happy about it now that I'm going to go into next season knowing that I can fight. And I know myself, and I know more and better than anyone what I need to improve on, where I'm not strong enough, where I'm strong enough. You know, I'm always open for criticism, things like that. But I'm the one who knows better than the others, right? So not in an arrogant way or a selfish way, but I know that I have to improve in a lot of areas and certain things. And I feel like I've already done that quite a lot in the last three, four, five races. I feel like I've delivered some very strong results. But on the whole, next year is hopefully a year where I can go in and decide before the first race we're going to fight for a championship. We've not ever thought of that. We've not even had the feeling of it from a team perspective and also for me as a driver. So hopefully the next year is that year. And we obviously have a lot of work to do. And Ferrari are going to be pushing a lot. But that's another year. For now, I'm just going to celebrate with my team tonight and celebrate what they deserve. Yeah, I was watching the TV screens and I saw Charles was P8 after lap one, so I was a little bit nervous! But I knew I just had to focus on myself, put my head down, and Carlos was never far away. I think the biggest I got the gap was to like 4.2 seconds in the first stint, and that's not a very nice gap in my opinion. It's a bit too close to my comfort. So it was still a tricky race, and I'm sure there was probably a lot more nervous people on the pit wall and in the garage, knowing what was at stake and things, and I’ve got the adrenaline of the car and focused on that. For them, they're just sitting and watching the screens, and they have a lot more time to think about what can go wrong and all of that. But, yeah, a shame for Oscar. We really wanted to have a one-two today and let McLaren be on top today as a team in a race, but also for a championship, you know, and I felt quite bad for him in the beginning. It wasn't his fault. But he's had a great year, so we'll all celebrate together. I certainly am. And we'll have some fun. Yeah, Carlos said it well, honestly. It was a tough one. I mean, I knew he probably pushed a good amount out of the pit lane to try and get me. I didn't have the finest in lap. I started to struggle a lot with the tyres. And like Carlos said, a set of tyres and how they perform and how they work on our car is all it needed to shift from them being quicker to myself. I think in the first stint, Carlos was probably the quicker driver-car combo. Just the dirty air is painful, even at three seconds, two seconds. To do that for a whole stint and stay that close is impressive. So I knew that he was very fast. But the whole season, we've always performed better on harder tyres. So simply just changing tyres and the characteristic of a tyre changing makes for one team to be the quickest to us to be the quickest. And that's how quickly and easily things can change. So I knew if we just executed a good pit stop, depending on how much he pushed out the box and how much he continued to push, that would decide my strategy, let's say. Do I also push to cover or do I introduced the tyres in a good way, because it was a long race ahead still. And I saw already in Turn 2 and Turn 3 a place you save the tyres that he saved immediately, which gave me some comfort and allowed me to start saving at the same time. So it's a difficult one because if he would have pushed too early, he would have completely gone off a cliff and maybe so would I. But it's very difficult to judge those kind of things at that time of race. Honestly, it's probably the harder moments, which are the ones you learn the most. So it's kind of true what people say. But those harder times, my battles with Max, that kind of thing, certain other cases throughout the season, you know. If I go back to Austria. Silverstone. You know, there are just some along the way and some have different reasons, but... None of them are necessarily ones which have made me doubt myself any more. This season's been my best season from a performance, like personally. Was it good enough? Probably it wasn't, no. But when you look at my own performance and my qualifying performances, for instance, they've been almost twice as good as what I was last year, especially comparing to the other guys in exactly the same car. So I've definitely stepped it up at a good level this season. I obviously lost out on a few things. And there were maybe three starts this year, which lost me one or two positions at times. But they were positions quite often just to Max. Or it was Budapest and one to Oscar and little things like that. But none of them, when I look back on them, made me feel like, well, I've not got what it takes. Those moments only came when it was directly against max. And it's Max. Going up against Max in any state is always going to be tricky. And no one has a nice time racing Max. I think Mexico was a bit of a turning point when it was proved that not everything he does is perfect. I think if we all go back to Austin and go back to Turn 12, the majority of, I say, almost everyone on the grid, as drivers and also externally, disagreed with the fact I got the penalty. We either both should not have got one or we both should have got one. You know, so... I think it's little cases along the way, but I certainly, from a pace point of view, have not doubted myself this year. And I think I've definitely given myself more faith. Like, when I look at qualifying, I remember 12 months ago here, I messed up my quali three lap, a lap that I should have done P2 when I had a big slide in 12, 13. And I was pretty annoyed with myself post quali. And that was what everyone spoke about then. But that's not really happened this year. I've closed off my quali laps. I've improved in all those areas. And it was more just that toe-to-toe fight, with one of the best in the world. And the thing is, what you don't see on the outside are some of those moments where if I did certain things, we would have crashed. People on the outside have no idea on what it takes and those moments where you accept losing a battle. And that is the case. And that was because of where we were in the first six, seven races of the year. We lost too many points. And I was just in that position where I couldn't gain as much as what I needed to and wanted to. But I'm not using any of these as excuses. I'm saying I didn't have what it took this season to fight against Max and deliver what I needed to deliver. But it certainly gave me the feeling of, ‘OK, if I improve this little bit here, this little bit here’, for the first time, I have confidence in saying I've definitely got what it takes. Yes, I will miss Carlos. I'm happy he's not in a quick car anymore! You know, the next driver who's coming in is also pretty handy. It's different. I mean, you know, Carlos is someone I know well. And I've started racing in Formula 1 with Carlos. You always knew he was going to be there and he was always going to put up a good fight today. In all of my meetings this morning, I was saying to the guys, like, let's be careful of Carlos, OK? Because I was ready for him to attack a lot and put up a good fight. He'll be back. Williams have been improving a lot. They've not had someone with a lot of genuine experience from a top team. Carlos will for sure add to that and propel the team forwards even more. They've gone under a lot of changes in the last few months and year or so. Even this year, there were some times when Williams were very quick. I'm expecting to still see him on track. I'm sure next year, Williams will take a good step forwards from where they are now. We don't know. We don't know when they'll be fighting. Even in 2026. It’s a year which is just over one year away from now, but 2026 is a year where anything can happen. Williams can be at the top all of a sudden. So we'll wait and see. But it's a shame because I think he's proven himself enough in in Formula 1 that he deserves a good seat. He deserves to fight for championships and wins and those types of things and it's a shame when that opportunity is lost. But it's not because he's not got talent or he's not got the ability, right? It's because it's the biggest name in Formula 1 who wants his seat. And yeah, we'll see in the future what it takes. See how Lewis does in Ferrari with Charles and against Charles. But he's proven himself enough. So I don't think anyone needs to doubt him. And I'm sure his time will come back again and he'll help Williams fight back to the top.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"It was very good, yeah. Quali was a bit of a struggle, honestly. We just expected, probably, to be a little bit better than what we were. The weekend so far has been quite straightforward from our side. It just seems like everyone caught up a lot come qualifying, and we had to start pushing a lot more. It was a good lap. It was not the cleanest, but sometimes when you're close enough to the edge and it's just a little bit untidy, sometimes it's actually quite a nice place to be. So I had a couple snaps, and I had a big snap into 9, the high speed. I just made a mistake. That hurt me a touch, but otherwise it was a nice lap. I put the rest of it together pretty well. Just not an easy circuit to do. We had a bit to gain in quali, because Max was looking a little bit quicker than us through the most part of it. So I knew I had to pull something out. Yeah, I mean, the track's been quick all weekend. You know, comparing to last year, we're quite a bit quicker. The cars are probably part of it, too. But the track's been good. The wind's been fairly consistent. Obviously, it rises through the day and dies away a bit through the night time. It has an effect but it's been quite consistent the whole weekend. So once you understand it, you know where you can push and use the wind and where you have to be a bit more on the cautious side and try and avoid it. I wouldn't be so sure about that. But if that's your analysis, then… We'll see. I think on a day like today with DRS and things, it's probably not our biggest strength. I think come the race, things even out a little bit more. So potentially, we knew we'd be a little bit on the back foot today with straight-line speed. We're hoping tomorrow it kind of comes back to us, because comparing to Ferrari, we're a little bit down. And comparing to Red Bull, we're quite a chunk down. It's not necessarily just downforce. We're at the lowest of what our wing can provide. The next step for us is too big. So maybe other people are just in more of a sweet spot and more in an optimal range this weekend than we are ourselves. The car's been great all weekend. It's performing well, and we'll make sure it does the same tomorrow. I mean, I feel like Zak's probably more nervous that we're first and second than if we were not, so... It gives us good knowledge that the car is great, of course. I think we've both been driving well this weekend, and we knew the pressure was on, from ourselves. So we've both performed well. We've both got everything out of the car. But this is a long race, and many things can happen. So we're definitely not going to get ahead of ourselves. We know we have a little bit of a gap in terms of positions. We're in a much more fortunate position than what Ferrari are. He's going to be putting up a good fight for his final race with Ferrari. You know, he's going to want to prove his point. And I'm excited to battle if that's the case. The difference for me probably is just being at the team for a longer period. Yeah, Oscar’s probably fortunate not to go through those first few years that we've had. I mean, there's some very fun years. Yeah, that's true. We didn't start off great last year, but I had some great times. Started off with this guy [Sainz] and we made progress, stepped back, made progress, stepped back. Nothing ever clicked, really, and never continued to grow. And it was hard just to break that barrier of getting close to Ferrari, Mercedes, and Red Bull, you know, because for such a long period of time, they've been the guys who have dominated Formula 1. Now, not only have we broken that barrier over the last year and a half, we've risen to the top of it and to become the best team and leading and hopefully to go on to win. I don't think, simply from the outside, people would give McLaren and my team enough credit for what they've done, what they've turned around, because it's not an easy sport. It may look simple at times from the outside and things like that. And even I think sometimes things are more simple than what they look. But to go from where we were to outdo… You know, Ferrari have turned things around a lot over the last couple of years and to catch Red Bull, which I've said a couple of times, and Max, who, yeah, one year ago dominated every race. for that to flip around so much, we can only just give a hats off to the whole team, because a lot of things have changed. People have come and gone, and Andrea has done an incredible job. So to be part of this whole story, to be part of it not long after Zak joined McLaren and started changing things and making McLaren into a slightly more happy place than it was prior, I've been along the journey with Zak, and we've gone through a lot of things together, highs and lows and emotional times. So it definitely has been a longer rise to get to where we are, which has been fun and I've really loved it and I've enjoyed it. And I think the thing I'll be proudest and most happy about is the fact I'm still here. The fact I'm still in papaya because I believed in the team for many years. I had opportunities to not be in papaya and to maybe go on and win races at an earlier stage in my career and those kind of things. I had those opportunities, but I believed and I wanted to simply do it with McLaren. I wanted to do it with the guys who gave me my opportunity in Formula 1. And as much as we didn't think it was going to be possible this year, we're hoping for next year. And next year was our kind of in-line target, on-paper target. The fact we're doing it this year is an even bigger achievement. Job not done, and Andrea will be happy that I say it, but I'm proud to be on this journey, to have been on it with McLaren for so many years, and I'll be very happy when hopefully it's all finished off.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it wasn't the best final lap. There's a couple of corners that I definitely would like to have again. But, you know, I'll take the front row. You know, it's been a bit of a tricky few weekends in qualifying. So, you know, the result at least is nice. But yeah, I knew that there was a couple of places immediately where I left a bit on the table. So, nope, that's how it is at the top end of the sport. You can't leave anything there because you’ll get eaten alive. And unfortunately did that today. And, you know, that's why I'm not on pole. So, yeah, probably wish I had that one again. It didn't help, but I knew starting the lap or even leaving the pits that that lap was at least on the board again, but I knew that I would need more to keep at least that position, or obviously I want to go for pole. So I knew I needed more anyway. And I found a bit more, just not quite enough. So yeah, it was a slightly stressful few minutes. I didn't really dwell on it too much but I did think I was in. Clearly it was so close that they've probably given me the benefit of the doubt, but yeah it wasn't exactly ideal. Not necessarily. I think it is extremely tight and not just with the teams we expected it to be tight with. You know, you've got a pretty jumbled up grid the whole way through. You know, Haas have looked very quick at points. Obviously, Hülkenberg's on the second row. Yeah, I think our pace through practice was, we almost felt it was a bit too good to be true and I think when we got to qualifying, that was potentially the case a bit. I think there's no questioning that we've clearly had a strong car and the strongest this weekend. It was all coming a little bit too easily to believe in practice. So, you know, we still had our work cut out for us. Q1 and Q2 weren't as straightforward as we would have liked as a team, I think. But, yeah, Q3 was a little bit more comfortable again. And, yeah, a 1-2 was nice. But I definitely didn't think this was guaranteed going into the week. Yeah, I think it will be very special if we can pull it off. You know, you obviously don't want to speak about it too much before the race. But even in my two seasons with the team, we've gone on quite the roller coaster from the team principal change before my first race. The car was a bit slower than what I thought I'd signed up for. And then from one weekend to the next, it seemed, it went from being struggling to get into the points to almost being able to fight for a podium. So I think even for myself, it would really mean a lot. And I think McLaren's come close a few times, but never had this kind of opportunity in the last 25 years. So it would be very, very special to be one of the two drivers to bring McLaren back to the top and be part of that next chapter of history. Yes, it means a lot. I think when you join F1… As a fan, I think it can be very difficult to understand why the Constructors' Championship means so much. And it's not just the financial benefits that the team gets. Of course that is a big bonus but I think the pride of so many people and I think that's what people struggle to understand and what I struggled to understand before I joined F1 is just how many people you know, preparing two race cars for Lando and I, and giving everything, you know, all their skills, all their time, sacrificing things in their life, pushing through things in their life just to see us succeed. And I think until you're actually involved in that, it's very, very difficult to understand it. So, yeah, I think probably there's a bit more attention now because it's been such a tight fight. I don't want to say it's McLaren, because I'm part of the team, but it's something we haven't achieved as a team for 25 years. And I feel like we've always had a good fan base through even the tough years. So I think we have a lot of people wanting us to do well. And we're just someone new compared to the last 15 years. So I think that's probably why there's a bit more attention on it. But it does mean a lot, even to us as drivers.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I felt like I did some very good, very clean laps in Q1 and Q2, probably finding the limit of the car very early on in qualifying and then giving myself and giving maybe the team a bit of hope that we could fight for pole position. But I think as soon as these two guys started putting, I think, a good lap together in Q3… I think my lap was pretty good. Obviously, there's always little things here and there that you would like to change. But when Lando talks about that he didn't quite nail Turn 9 or he did a small mistake, then you realise that it's the same for everyone. And, you know, we've been a weekend three to four tenths behind. I'll take being two tenths off in quali and hopefully we can match their race pace and get in the fight tomorrow. I think realistically, once you look in detail the layout of the track, I think I kind of understand that they are a bit quicker. If all the track was long straights and Turn 6 and 7s, then I think we would be flying around here. But unfortunately, we have Turn 1, we have Turn 9, where the McLaren is a clear step ahead of us, like we saw in Qatar. And yeah, they're simply a better package for this circuit. It's unfortunate, you know, that the last two races of the season, it's come to tracks where maybe the McLaren is just that last tenth, two tenths quicker. But at the same time, that's how the season goes. And if that's the case, we should have done our homework earlier. Yeah, I think it was already extremely difficult. It was, like I said, a bit of a mission impossible already before the weekend started. Then we arrived to FP1 and Charles' battery died before running and the grid penalty obviously was a huge shock, a huge blow. On top of that, you get the Q2 situation for Charles. It just makes things obviously a lot more difficult. But at the same time, It is very likely that even in a perfect weekend where we both nail laps in Q3 and we even fight for the win, these two guys are still up there. So it was always going to be difficult. It's just made our life even more difficult. But until the chequered flag comes down tomorrow, you know, anything can happen. And I'm going to keep fighting for whatever comes. And I'm sure Charles from the back will push flat out to get every single point available and see what happens with the McLarens. I didn't have to take more margin, but I did by accident. Yeah, I lost a decent amount of time through Turn 1, which was a shame. But I obviously had in mind that even though the lap got given back, I obviously knew it was incredibly close. But yeah, I probably gave a little bit more margin than I wanted to. So that was a bit of a shame. You know, I think if it hadn't have been taken away, then given back, maybe I would have been a little bit more aggressive through there. But, you know, that's how it is. It's the same rules for everybody. So, yep, I'll just take P2. Yeah, I don't know how it's going to feel. I can only tell you how it feels up until now and I can tell you the level of focus of the whole team and my level of focus has been so high to try and execute a perfect weekend and try to win the race tomorrow and try to be on pole today, that honestly I haven't had much time to be emotional, apart from obviously little details that the team is doing so far to make me feel at home and feel proud of this last race with the team. But at the same time, I'm pretty sure tomorrow before the race or after the race, it will start to sink in. It will start to hit me a bit and it will get emotional. But the truth is that up until now, I've had no time for that. We're all so focused and we all want that constructors or that last win together. You know that you have no time to get too emotional, but tomorrow I will for sure. Yeah, I fully agree. I think every fan or every journalist or maybe every person that is not fully or doesn't fully buy the Constructors' Championship, the moment you visit a Formula 1 factory, you understand why it exists and why it's so important. Because when you visit a Formula 1 factory and you see more than a thousand people working for just us drivers to take the car and make it perform. We are just the last bit of the chain that there is behind all these teams and every single guy from the team counts in that difference and it's the drivers’ job and team principal's job and the main engineers’ job to make these people feel like it counts. So every single one can make a hundredth of a difference in the team and those hundredths add up to the last tenth that maybe made McLaren quicker today and That is where all that last difference is and why it's so important. On top of that, I think Formula 1 is in a good space right now, with a level playing field between driver being important, but also the team. I think teams are given more equal opportunity to fight. And it's not only all about budget. It's the people, it's the infrastructure that you can have, that you can achieve. And you can see it with McLaren, you can see it with the top four teams right now, we are all within a couple of tenths of one another, and it makes the Drivers’ Championship more fair because the driver can make more of a difference, but also the Constructors’ Championship more fair. And it's a shame in a way that this is resetting in ‘26 because I feel like Formula 1 is for once in a very, very long time achieving a level playing field among all teams and all drivers to show who is the best team but who is also the best driver. And yeah, I think that's it's a bit of a pity. No, I wouldn't sign up for a P3 because I know we're capable of more and as Lando said, I also have a bit less to lose tomorrow. We know we need to do more than what we did today and we're going to go for it tomorrow, because, one, we need it for the Constructors’. If we want to have a shot at winning, we need to win tomorrow and one of the McLarens to have an issue and Charles to get back in the points. And two, I also want to win. This might be my last chance at winning in a few years and my last chance of being on a podium for a few years. And I want to make sure I leave the weekend with no regrets and with never feeling that I could have, yeah, not given myself that chance. So, yeah, I feel like I've put myself in a good position for tomorrow. But yeah, tomorrow we go again.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Well, definitely, well, first of all, I think this weekend is going to be quite emotional, quite intense, not only because of it being the last weekend, but also for how much is at stake with the Constructors' title. At the same time, it's been a tough year in general with a lot going on in the background. I think I have to be quite happy, quite proud of how I handled every situation through the year and how I managed to push myself to get to the end of the year still in good shape, in good form and ready to fight for that. I think it's honestly very tight between us, but not only between Ferrari, McLaren, but also Mercedes and Red Bull. I think we are all within a couple of tenths of each other. And depending on the track, depending on the tyre compound we use, depending on the track characteristics, the wind, the conditions, one car will come out on top that weekend. And last weekend looked like it was going to be the McLaren. In the end, it was Max. the other weekend, George, the other weekend, me in Mexico, or again, Max in the wet in Brazil. It's almost like it’s so tight across the top four teams that you cannot pick one before a weekend. And I think we're all waiting to practice to see who suddenly seems the strongest that weekend. Would mean everything to me, honestly. It's, I think, the best way to say goodbye to my home these last four years and to the team that I've given my absolute best to for the last four years and I've enjoyed every single moment with them. And to say goodbye with a Constructors' title, I think, would be the perfect sign off, the perfect goodbye. I am also honest with you saying that it's still not a long shot, but it is a difficult one. Being 21 points behind two of the fastest drivers and one of the fastest teams and recovering those 21 points in one weekend requires perfection from our side and probably not optimal weekend or a bad weekend from their side. It's still going to be difficult, but I've seen worse things in racing happen before, and we're going to give it our best shot. Yes and no. I think through some of the races in the second half of the season, especially when we were starting to take some points out of Max, there was kind of the urgency to make sure that was still happening for the Drivers' Championship. And I think, you know, now it's obviously a similar scenario for the Constructors. You know, Qatar didn't end exactly how we wanted as a team but I think the confidence is still there. And yes, of course, there's a lot riding on this weekend, it's obvious, but I think the best way of tackling it is just how we have done and trying to get the most out of our car, because I think it's very early now to start keeping both eyes on what Ferrari do. We need to keep at least one eye, probably both for now, on our own performance. I think it's a very delicate matter. You know, I don't understand fully the whole picture of why Zandvoort may or may not stay longer than the 2026 season. I think as a whole, the sport has definitely moved towards having more races outside of Europe than in Europe. Probably for economic and obviously political and economic reasons for the sport. In an ideal world, In my opinion, the Formula 1 season should have around 20 races. Out of those 20 races, I strongly believe six to eight of them should be in Europe because that's where the sport comes from. And all of the others should remain rotational. If Zandvoort cannot keep the budget to run a Formula 1 race when some other races can, it doesn't mean I think Zandvoort should completely disappear from the calendar, but maybe come back every two or three years back to a calendar to give all the Dutch fans and all the supporter of Max the opportunity to watch Max live, you know, and the same would apply to Spain, the same would apply to the UK if that's ever the case. So, yeah, find ways to, even if these old school circuits, European circuits that maybe don't have the big budgets that outside of Europe, they have these budgets, still find a way to give them the opportunity to keep coming back to a calendar now and then. I don't know if it's doable or not, but in my ideal F1 calendar scenario, I would try and fit that in. I think it's a fair question. And I think you'll see a lot of the times drivers trying to give credit to the mechanics because for me, they are one of the heroes of the sport. The guys that put in longer hours, traveling in different conditions than some of the high member of the staff travel in. They spend hours and hours away from home. They all have families. They all have people to go back to and they spend even more time at the track than us. And yeah, they are in a condition that they.. It is incredible to see the effort that they put into it and the passion. If there's one thing, one of the biggest things that I'm going to miss in Ferrari is the mechanics. The passion that you see in Ferrari mechanics, no disrespect to any other team in the grid, but it's something unbelievable to see. They understand racing. They understand strategy. They follow the race. And you can tell they know exactly what's going on. They want to know what's going on. And, yeah, when they go back to Maranello, they are even a bit famous, you know, because they are a Ferrari mechanic. And this only happens in Ferrari. And I've enjoyed a lot of that time with them. And, yeah, I feel like it's a very special trait that Ferrari mechanics have that I'm definitely going to miss. But yeah, as Lewis said also before, you make friends. I'm still going to see them in the paddock a lot of the times. And I feel like sometimes it is worth giving credit to these people because they are truly a great part of the sport and a great part of the success of any Formula 1 team. I would obviously love to. to contribute to that Constructors' title with a win. In the end, a win is what we need. I think we're going to need to have both cars on the podium if we want to clinch the championship, unless something very disastrous happens to McLaren. And yeah, that is my target. A different thing is now when we run the car on Friday, whether we have the capacity to win or not, and the performance this weekend to achieve that, but in the mindset of the whole team, we know we need to have both cars in the podium, ideally in a 1-2 position to have that, and to give ourselves the best possible chance to achieve that. It's going to be tough. It's a circuit that I think suits pretty much every car of the top four. And there's some long straights, with some slow speed that could help the Ferrari. There's some medium-long speed combined that could help the McLaren and the Red Bull. It's at night, which could help the Mercedes. So there's so many things, you know, and so many teams and drivers in contention for the win that it's impossible for me right now to say who can take that. No, honestly, I don't think a seven-time world champion that has changed teams multiple times or a few times in the past needs my advice. The only thing I can obviously recommend him or tell him is to enjoy it. It's an incredible place to be part of and an incredible place to drive and feel like a Formula 1 driver. I believe he will get an incredible treatment by the tifosi and by all the supporters, engineers, mechanics, everyone involved in Ferrari and enjoy it because there's nothing better than being a Ferrari Formula 1 driver. And yeah, I'm sure he's going to enjoy that. It's very difficult to pick one of the four wins, because they are all relatively similar in ways that they are… Four very different wins, but four very emotional. Silverstone because it was the first one and the first one you never forget. Singapore because that year was quite special to win in Singapore the way we won it. Australia because I was coming back from the tough winter and the appendicitis and suddenly I won and it was emotional. And then Mexico, because at the time it could be my last win and my mom was there, my whole family, my friends were there to see me win and it felt really special. At the same time one moment that I will never forget was driving out of the pits in Fiorano for my first outing in a Ferrari. I think that's one thing that for sure will stay with me forever. And it was probably out of the success or the great moments, that one is a pretty special one.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"I think still confident. Like Carlos said, we're still in a good spot in terms of the lead we have. I think it's going to be a very tightly fought weekend between probably the top four teams, not just us and Ferrari, which means that some of the other teams can potentially play a role in deciding the championship. So let's see. We're going to focus on ourselves and try and get the most out of our game our car that we have and I guess see where we end up. But I think we're in a good spot and still confident. I think a good improvement from my rookie season. but still room to go. I think a few races at the start of the season, a few races more recently have not gone as well as I would have liked. And I think also as a team, there's some races through the year that we would have liked to have executed a bit better. But I think, especially in the middle part of the year, I was very happy with the level I was performing at and I think I showed some pretty clear progress from last season. I think mainly in qualifying, I've made life too difficult for myself this year. But I think last year in a lot of the races, I wouldn't have had the tools to get back through. Whereas this year, I feel like I have. So I think on a personal note, it's been a good improvement. But yeah, still some room to go. Yeah, I mean, much of the message is the same. I think we need to be careful as a sport not to get rid of all the tracks that we all grew up racing on and loving. I think if you ask most of the drivers on the grid, their favourite track, maybe apart from Suzuka, is probably guaranteed to be in Europe somewhere. And I think we need to be careful to not get rid of all of these tracks. There's some that already aren't on the calendar that I think we all would love to go back racing on. Again, I don't know the full ins and outs of why Zandvoort is not returning after 2026. It's a bit of a logistical challenge racing in Zandvoort, with the layout of the track and the kind of split paddock and stuff like that, so it is demanding and obviously we're getting another team which is going to add to that demand. But yeah I think we need to be wary as a sport that a lot of the tracks that will disappear from the calendar are probably the ones that we all love a lot. So, yeah, I think we just need to be a bit careful with which ones we get rid of. I think compared to my first season in F1, it's been better, I would say, because I know what to expect this year. I think these last couple of triple headers have been tough. I mean, not just for us, but I think everyone in the room probably. Going from Vegas to Qatar with some pretty wacky time zones is very tough. But I think, for us as drivers, it's difficult, but it's more the teams and the mechanics that we were speaking about before, especially. Turning up on Tuesday or Wednesday, building the car, you know, making sure it's at the best level it can be. And reliability these days is so good that any little blip you have costs a lot. So for us, I think we find it difficult, but we have the team or our teams much more in mind with these long seasons and the amount of travelling that they do, the amount of time they spend away from their families. I think we're seeing more and more people now that, you know, the teams need to employ more people because trying to do 24 races for a lot of people with families just doesn't make sense anymore. So it has some knock-on effects. And I think, you know, I think giving F1 and the FIA credit, I think where we're going in terms of the calendar and trying to streamline it is making things better. But I think there's still some tweaking to go. And yeah, again, a lot of our concerns are about our much wider teams than for us personally.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Pretty calm at the moment. Feeling positive and excited just to give it all this weekend. Every moment, like through the year, it's been, you know, every single race has been obviously the last time I'll race and be in that specific place with the team and I think today, already from like the briefings that we've had, like, you're sitting there and you're realising these are the last moments with the team, which is… It's hard to describe the feeling. It's not the greatest, of course, but I think mostly I’m just really proud of what we've achieved. And I have so much pride in this team. I think it's the smiles, when we've had the success. I think it's those moments. Like I remember one particular engineer, for example, I remember our first win in Australia in 2014, I think it was Australia, and I just remember him being in tears when we were on the podium. It's those moments that I take with me. It's the emotions that we had in Silverstone this year. It's all the good bits. Naturally, you mostly remember the good bits. And I think it's just the... I'm just incredibly proud, but also just so grateful to every single individual, both that are here at the track, but also back at the factory that have just worked tirelessly and, you know, been supporting me for all these years from day one. If I'm honest, I don't really remember the... Obviously, I remember meeting Niki. And I remember making the decision. But I don't really remember the final days, if I'm really honest. I don't really know. I've got a really bad memory, as you know. It definitely wasn't as painful and difficult as this year has been in terms of the emotions. And I think because it was at the end of the year, it was much quicker and there wasn't enough time for it to really settle in for anyone, I think, within the team. Yeah, this one is much more emotional because I've been with the team so long and we've been through so much together. I mean, the first meeting with Toto at the beginning of the year was awkward, of course. So it was awkward from the get-go, to the day after when I took some of the team paintballing. And they had just found out. So I mean, there's been loads of moments through the year… Yeah, I got lots of shots from people, yeah, loads of bruises. Yeah, people went in on me that day! I think ultimately I anticipated it would be difficult, but massively underestimated how difficult it would be. And it was straining on the relationship very early on, took time for people to get past it. And then just for my own self, it's been a very emotional year for me. And I think I've not been at my best in handling and dealing with those emotions. And I think this year, and so many of you have been here my whole career, so some of you, I think, you've all seen the worst of me and seen the best of me and I'm not going to apologise for either because I'm only human and I don't always get it right, and I would definitely would say this year's been one of the worst in terms of handling that from my side, which I'll work on trying to be better at. But I hope the good and the highs far outweigh the negatives and how I've handled it or behaved. And as I said, I just remember the good times, you know. I've built some incredible relationships. We've gone through. If you imagine, when you're going when you're going through a season together with so many people, you know, not only on those race weekends where you're riding the highs and lows together, but in their personal lives, through marriages, through divorces, through loss of family members, through cancer, through all sorts. You're going through these journeys with these people. So it's a really beautiful journey you go on together. And being that it was so long, the emotions run so deep. So much time to think about what to say. I mean, I agree with the comments so far. I mean, I think it's really sad to be losing Zandvoort, particularly if you look, the crowd is incredible there. There's such a huge following, obviously, mostly for Max, but in general, the fans are what make the sport what it is. And then there are several races in the calendar – I'm not going to mention which ones, but you know which ones – which don't have a lot of people that come, yet financially, obviously, they can cover, I guess, whatever the cost is. So I don't know. I think the business is doing very, very well. And I think we've got to make sure we hold on to the heritage races, which Zandvoort, for me, is one of those. I think that's not really a huge amount more for me to add, but they are the unsung heroes. And all credit goes to should go to the team because they are the soldiers that really are on the front line. They're the ones there weekend in, weekend out. And yeah, I'm not really sure what else to add. The team is everything. And the bonds between every person in the team, there's not one person in the team that's more important than the other. Everyone needs to be rowing in the same direction and pulling their weight, which they do. It's a real privilege to see people operating at their best, especially when everyone does gel together. There's certain points you don't always get it. It's not always perfect rhythm, but every now and then you get that synergy and you have this amazing performance together. It's quite special. I mean, I'm not looking at comparing myself to Michael. Not looking at that. At the moment, that's not something that I'm thinking about. Obviously, I'm trying to think about making sure that finish off the right way and the best way possible with Mercedes. These next days are going to be super emotional. It's all a big unknown for what's up ahead. Obviously, massive excitement. And yeah, I can't really add much more at the moment. I don't have anything else to say about it. I mean, I can't really say too much about the world. But I mean, it's because it's still a bit of a mess, right? But I'm really, really proud of the work, I'm incredibly proud of the work that we've done at Mercedes, for example, in terms of the steps we've taken, the investment from Mercedes, everyone stepping up and really being a part of and being open to change. The team is far more diverse than it ever has been. It's far more inclusive, very open-minded. And our hope was that in doing so, the rest of the sport would follow. And I think it has, we've just seen Formula 1 and the FIA and all the teams see the importance of it and now be on board. And so I'm really, that's one of the things I'm probably most proud of is being a part of sparking that. And I'm truly grateful for everyone that's now on board. And I feel like the sport then is moving in the right direction, so. Of course it really sparks motivation and it's a dream scenario for any driver to have an opportunity like this. So, don't take that for granted. Also, you know, massive respect for Carlos and everything he's done within the team. And I realise it's a steep… You know, I remember when I joined Mercedes, and it's not an easy step to ever enter into a new team. And it takes time to build new relationships and learn the tools and everything. Coming into next year with that same focus, that same might that I had when I joined Mercedes and with ultimately that leap of faith, I think is exciting and exhilarating.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Mercedes
Nico Hülkenberg,"Positive, with a lot of good emotions, with a lot of joy and fun that I had over the past two years. I think we've, you know, we've grown together and pretty strong in that time and it's been a very fun ride and journey with them. I think we, at least personally for myself, you know, really outperformed the expectations, certainly that I had personally coming into, you know, the overtime part of my career after two years out. So I reflect on it in a very positive way. and especially this year you know I think it's been very successful and I feel regardless of where we're going to end up Sunday night you know we we've had a very successful year and we kind of won already. But that doesn't mean of course that we're that we're not going to try this weekend. Well, I think naturally you always go back to the most successful races. But I think for me, that's too simple. It's just been, you know, the ride and the journey together. Like I said, I had a lot of fun and joy. And, you know, I've not always felt that much joy racing and working in Formula 1. So for me, that's just the best thing and obviously the overtime of the overtime that is still to come from you know next year onwards I think that's probably also the extended highlight. I see it very tight. The whole midfield is very tight, like we saw over the last few weekends. Small things can make a big difference. I think it is going to be very difficult this weekend to turn it around after what happened last Sunday and them [Alpine] scoring a lot of points again. But our package is competitive. We're quick on merit. Personally, all I want to achieve is to maximise and optimise this final weekend together and enjoy it. Yeah, no, I don't understand it either. Like Max explained, in Qatar, there was a lot of different, you know, run profiles, people doing all sorts of different stuff. And, you know, it's very easy to get tangled up. But we drivers know that, too and I think we also have to build that in and, you know, leave some buffer. And, yeah, I don't understand why Max got a penalty there. I would like to do less mistakes next year, but it's a tight midfield, and it's always a very small, fine, narrow window because we're so tight. Sometimes you have to leave the comfort zone. You have to take risks, and mistakes do happen very easily. And with these cars, if you lose it, you lose it in a big way often. That's maybe one thing. And I'm just very happy and proud of the season, what we've done this year, how we've picked ourselves up from last year and where we started this year and how we've come through. A couple of really strong performances from everyone in the team. And that's been a happy, proud moment. Yeah, it's impossible to tell now. You know, you have to drive the car to understand it, to feel it, to really know what's going on. So just from paper, it's impossible to tell for us right now.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Haas
Max Verstappen,"I mean, it's a bit of a different track here, but it also shows that even when things are not going well, there's still an opportunity that you can turn things around or make it more competitive, because in Qatar, starting the weekend, we were not very quick. And then, yeah, when we went into qualifying, the proper qualifying, we were there to fight, so it shows that there was some more performance in the car and I was very happy with that. This track? It's been good to us in the past, but of course this year a lot has changed anyway. So I'm just relaxed and looking forward to it. Hopefully we learn a bit more about the car that we can also use them for next year. Well, I mean, it would be nice, but it's not something that will change the world for us in the winter. We know what we have to work on. So, yeah, we just try to be as competitive as we can be. I mean, we had this chat already in Vegas. I mean, I still have the same opinion! We did a special press conference for it. I sat there. I was waiting. I wanted to go out. I wanted to have a beer. I wanted to have a drink. Now I'm answering the same question again. I wanted more. I ran out. I had to sit there. I could not… They can watch it back! Yeah, I mean, of course, when I look at it, it's, of course, something that I'm sad about that it's not going to continue. But on the other hand, also, I'm very proud of what they have done. And I think when I started in Formula 1, I would have never imagined that we would go back to Zandvoort. And the races that we've had there, the event that they put on, I have a lot of respect for that. And I'm proud that I played a part in that as well. And seeing all the fans there was and is, of course, amazing. And I'm really looking forward to the final two years. But they can be very proud of what they have achieved. And yeah, I think the final year, 26, we have a Sprint event also. They say they're going to go out with a bang. So I'm also very excited to see that. Yeah, I'm going to go flat out on my cool app. And I'm going to act like I'm going to crash with everyone. I know. Honestly, I just didn't understand. I didn't even know why I was in there. And then, honestly, when I was in there, I was just trying to explain the story behind it. I was just trying to be nice. Lando passed me because he was a second behind me on the SC2. He was on colder tyres because he only did a build. Or he had to abort his lap or whatever. So he passed me. I was like, ‘OK, whatever, I just back out. I don't want to be in anyone's way’. We're anyway in Q3, just finding track position. Then I think Fernando came out of the pits with new tyres. And I think it was quite clear that weekend with the new tyres, you have to push quite hard on the out lap to get temp. So out of Turn 10, I see him in the mirror, flying. I'm like, ‘OK, I'll let him by, whatever, and then I’ll just sort myself out’. Then, of course, everything slowed up in front, because there were quite a few cars. And I slowed down as well, because I don't want to then speed up, try to ruin their preparation as well. And then I see someone flying in my mirror, acting like the most dangerous situation just happened and he almost killed himself or something. It was unbelievable. And we were all on the slow lap. It's not even like someone was on a fast lap. So yeah, when I got called to the Stewards, it was a big surprise to me, because I didn't really impede anyone. I think also on the slow lap, we all drive on our normal lines, because we're all trying not to pick up dirt anyway. It's not necessary when everyone is driving slow. But then, yeah, I don't know how they came, of course, to that conclusion. It was, of course, for me, very disappointing, because, by actually trying to stay out of trouble, you put yourself in trouble. And also, I think, at that point of the season, almost the end of the season, I don't want to be fighting with anyone. They come after me after qualifying, like, ‘why didn't you ruin my lap, to start my lap? What are you doing?’ So I'm like, oh, I don't want to put myself in that position. But basically, by doing that, I put myself in that position where I had to be going to the Stewards. And I felt straight away when I was in there, it was not going to go anywhere. So it was very weird. Yeah, it's very difficult to pinpoint that. I mean, our car from the start, of course, has not been the easiest to drive. We were still, of course, dominant in the beginning, but then I think, yeah, with some upgrades on the car, it made it even more difficult to drive. Of course, also for me, but I think even more for Checo for his driving style. And yeah, when others are closing up, every little detail makes a massive difference in results or where you qualify. Because if you then don't qualify well, you're in the middle of the pack, things can go wrong. And yeah, from my side, it's very difficult to comment for him, why things have gone the way they have gone. But I can tell you that, of course, in the middle of the season, especially, our car has been a bit all over the shop, sometimes quite positive. And again, very difficult. And even for us, it was just very hard to find the direction. And for sure, that also didn't help Checo in general. I mean, I have to say he's always been a great team player, and I've always enjoyed working with him every single Grand Prix, even when we had tough times. I think he was always there to try and get the best possible result out of it. So for me, there's nothing negative at all to say about him. We get on super well. And of course, when I see sometimes he's struggling with the results, it's not nice to see, also for the team. But I think also the team has always given their very best and always tried to support him in the best possible way, you know, to get the best out of it. But unfortunately, that didn't always happen. Of course, I'm proud of winning the championship. But besides that, I think how we have worked as a team and how I've also kept myself together throughout a tough period in the season where it was easy to be demotivated and give up on a lot of things. Actually working harder with the team, you know, trying to find solutions and getting on top of it or at least understanding our trouble and again bounce back and still achieve some great results at the end of the year. Plus, I think the race in Brazil. The emotions went from being super upset in the morning, looking like you were going to lose a lot of points in the championship and it actually becoming a proper fight, to then, of course, winning the race from P17. For me, that is definitely a race that I'm very proud of in how we've handled everything. I think all those things together. Yeah, I mean, I think it helped that a lot came out in Hungary. And after that, yeah, we had some good chats within the team. And it never works, you know, when you're frustrated all the time because you're not going to move forward. So I think from there onwards, you know, we really worked well together and actually tried to really actively look for improvements and solutions. And it was hard to understand at times, but I think at one point we found a direction that we had to look into, and that's what we continue to do. No. No regrets at all, because I meant everything I said. And it's still the same. If I had to do it again, maybe I would have said even more, knowing the outcome of the race result. I still can't believe that someone can be like that in a Stewards’ room. For me, that was so unacceptable, because I mean, we're all racing drivers. We all have a lot of respect for each other. We even play sports together. You travel together. And of course, you have moments where you get together, you crash or whatever. You're not happy. In my whole career, I've never experienced what I have experienced in the Stewards’ room in Qatar. And for me, that was really unacceptable. It was just a normal question. I mean, I knew that I lifted, and I suddenly look in the mirror, and I saw that the gap closed up a lot. So I just asked, did he lift or not, just to double check. Of course, sometimes with yellow flags, some people lift more than others. And yeah, you can gain some tens here or there. I luckily tried to play it safe, and then just asked and see the outcome of it. Yeah, I mean, we had a tough time. And the problem was that we didn't really understand, I think, fully what was the reason behind it, because all the numbers that we saw were actually promising. So it's just trying to find it, trying to understand what is going wrong, trying to improve that balance in the car. And that's what we have done. And it took, of course, a few races to get on top of. And then, of course, you have to make changes. And in a season with a budget gap, it's very tough sometimes also to calculate what you can do and what you cannot do. Some things you cannot change in the season. This is for next year. But I'm proud of how we have found solutions and how we have become, again, more competitive. For me, it's more about just always trying to find more performance. You always want to do better. And of course, there are always limitations with the car that you work on. And I think this year we found a few more limitations than last year. So at least it gives us more directions to work on for next year. And time will tell where we are. Yeah, I think in ‘23, everything almost went by itself. Of course, I did my work. I went to drive on the simulator. But when the car is in a very nice window, sometimes when you try to overstress things, it also doesn't work when you try to look into too many details. That's anyway how I never operated, trying to look into too many details, because it can also work against you. This year was a lot more difficult. Everyone was struggling to understand, of course, for me as well, I didn't understand why we were where we were. So just asking questions, working together, looking at data, looking at analysis that came up after every single race we can. And of course, I'm not the engineer, I'm not going to tell them how to design a floor or whatever, a suspension. But I can ask questions, and then we discuss, and we go through what we can see from the data of the track, wind tunnels, CFD, all these things, simulator. And with all the smart heads in the team, you sit together and you just have an open discussion about things. And I explain my difficulties with the car. Of course, we do it here as well. We're talking and we're talking back to the factory. But it's not eye to eye with everyone. And that's why I think sometimes it's very important to have everyone together in the same room. No, it has nothing to do with him being the director of the GPDA. I just never expected someone to really try and actively get someone a penalty that badly and lying about why I was doing what I was doing. But clearly, it had an influence to them. Yeah, it was just really not nice and actually very shocking what was going on there. I'm in the middle. I mean, time will tell. I don't know if it's going to be nice. I don't know if it's going to be bad. I just, it's impossible to say now that, you know, the outcome of it. I just wait and see until we have the real car. And then, you know, you can judge a bit better if it's positive or not.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it was a tricky race, I think. The cars at the front seemed to have very similar pace to each other. And it was really, really tough to make the inroads to get into DRS and then far enough into DRS to overtake. So a couple of good moments with Charles out there. And yeah, nice to end up on the podium, but not quite the result we're looking for. Yeah, I'm not sure what Lando's penalty was for, but obviously quite a big one. So, yeah, going to be an exciting end to the year. Hopefully we can be strong, but it's going to take everything we've got to seal the deal. Definitely. I think just the temperature as well, you know. The track's a lot faster this year, so it should be tougher, but I think the fact that it's not a sauna in the car this year is making life a bit easier. So, fun race, a mega track. It's probably the most fun of the whole year around here, so yeah, enjoyed the race just not quite the result. I mean, yes, but that's how racing goes sometimes, unfortunately. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. I feel like we've had that happen quite a few times this year, but we've had our fair share of luck as well. So I think the pace was decent, just not quite strong enough in the right places on the track, which made trying to get close pretty tough. Because I think once I had some clean air, the pace was strong. Yeah, I think, you know, fighting for the win, given where I started and how the first part of the race panned out was always going to be a challenge, but I'm pretty happy to end up on the podium. Yes and no. I think the track this is very different to last year in terms of the grip level. I think our car in certain conditions is quite different to last year as well, and I feel like some of our strengths that we had last year are not really strengths anymore because everybody else has caught up to us and I feel like some of our weaknesses are not really our weaknesses either, and I feel like it's a much more well-rounded car. But I think also maybe the grip level has taken away some of our strengths that we've had in the past here. I mean, I always expected it to be tight. I didn't expect it to be necessarily as, you know… I think apart from Max last year, we were very competitive here. But I always thought it was going to be pretty tough between the top four teams. Hopefully going well for us. I think it will be a track that's stronger for Ferrari, I would say. I was maybe a little bit surprised at the pace they had today. But I don't think we'll be slow next week either. I think it will be a good battle. I think, you know, the top four teams at the moment are very, very close on their days. So, yeah, I'm expecting more of the same next week. I think the right thing to do would have been a VSC or a Safety Car pretty much straight away. I mean, I didn't really know where the mirror was, but after seeing it on the big screen, being basically in the braking zone for Turn 1 when you're trying to overtake, I don't really know what we were going to do until someone hit it, because I think having it sit there for 30 laps of the race would have been not very smart. So I think, yes, probably should have been a bit earlier because, you know, at racing speeds, especially in that part of the track, you can't have a marshal run on and just simply pick it up. So maybe we could have been a bit quicker with that. But yeah, I think the car that hit it, I don't know if they got a puncture or not, but yeah, maybe something that could have been a bit speedier.",Qatar,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"I'm really happy. I mean, honestly, I would have signed straight away if I had a paper that told me that we will finish second after a weekend like this, especially on a track like this, because our car characteristics are not fitting very well with this track. And we knew it was going to be a very difficult weekend compared to the McLaren, but at the end, we managed to take some points away from them. So, yeah, the fight will be all the way to the last race in Abu Dhabi next week. Honestly, I don't know whether it was the debris or the way the kerb are and the way we need to ride the kerbs. On the kerbs, I just ignored it, because I knew that there was too much performance in it and I was just hoping to not have a puncture myself as well. For the debris, I was staying on the left in the straights hoping that it wouldn't bite me and it didn't, hopefully. It's a shame for Carlos because obviously as a team, it would have been great to be further up with Carlos, but yeah, it's the way it goes and it's still a positive weekend overall for the team. Ah, it's difficult to know. I think we are all very close, so I think it's going to be very tight, but it's exciting. Yeah, 21 points is still a lot, but everything is possible and we'll give it all. Yes, we did. Yes, we did, because to be honest, we knew that it would be very difficult pace-wise. We expected McLaren to be very strong in terms of race pace. We maybe did not expect Max to be that strong, but he was super strong today. However, finishing second after such a weekend, where the track characteristics are very far off from the optimal of the track characteristics we need for our car, is a surprise. We got a little bit lucky, obviously on my side. A bit unlucky with Carlos and his puncture. But as a team, it's been a positive weekend. So yes, we exceeded our expectations because coming into the weekend, I kind of expected to lose a bit of points compared to McLaren here. However, we recovered some, so that's good. Not much. I felt like we optimised yesterday and today. We knew that it wasn't going to be our strongest weekend, but we decided to just focus on ourselves and try to do what was the best possible result for us. And I think we achieved that very well. We should be happy. Then we of course need to look at what we can do in the future to be faster on those kind of tracks. But yeah, this weekend we did work very well as a team. Yeah, I did not drink, but I honestly, I don't think it was that much of an issue for this race. Last year it would have been a really, really big issue. I think I wouldn't have finished the race without my drink, but this year it was actually pretty, pretty chill. So yeah, in terms of dehydration, it wasn't bad, but it was quite physical in the corners just because we had no saving to do today. There was basically no saving. It was just flat out pushing from the first lap to the last lap, which is quite enjoyable as a driver. I don't think any of us drivers had our heads straight in the fast corners at the end of the race. It was very physical. Well, it's difficult to say. To be honest, I haven't even seen the numbers yet. So we've got to wait and see. But I feel like on paper, it should be a bit more positive than Qatar was. Because on race pace… Again, today we've been quite lucky, but without what happened to Lando, we would have been very, very far off. And without the Safety Car, we would have been very far off. In terms of race pace, we weren't fast. So I feel like... Yeah, Abu Dhabi should be better for us. So I hope so. But we'll wait and see. But it's not too many points between us. So we've just got to focus on ourselves and try to maximise everything. And hopefully we'll bring back the title to Maranello. I mean, that would be cool. It's better than P3, but it's not the most exciting position to fight for. However, in a year like this, where it's been very tricky for the team and we've went through very difficult times, it will be still a satisfaction to get that P2. So, yeah, I'll still do absolutely everything to get it. But the Constructors’ is more important. Yeah, I agree. I mean, I don't know how obvious it was on TV, but for us in the car, it wasn't that obvious. I didn't know where the mirror was. I don't know what it was. Obviously, it was quite clear once someone picked up the mirror and there was debris everywhere. But before that, it wasn't that bad. So, yeah, again, I don't think it was that bad.",Qatar,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a very good race. Of course, already yesterday in qualifying, the car was a lot better. And, yeah, today, that first stint was very, very fast. Lando and I were just within 1.8 seconds of each other the whole time, pushing each other. And honestly, it was a lot of fun out there. This track has a lot of grip. And this year, the tyres were really holding on. So that was honestly a lot of fun to be really pushing the tyre. And yeah, we went really long in that first stint. After that, of course, there were a few Safety Car moments that you had to take care. But very happy. It's been a while in the dry to be this competitive and very proud of everyone within the team to turn it around within a day. So they definitely also deserve this victory. On the Hard tyres, there's very little grip. You know, you just come out of the box, so they're already cold. And then immediately, of course, we had the Safety Car. And behind the Safety Car, you can't warm them up. And then I tried something different out of the last corner where I had no rear grip, basically. So I just struggled for traction out of the corner. And then it got a bit spicy into Turn 1, but I think that's great to see. And then, yeah, after that, we drove it to the end with good pace. So, yeah, very happy to win here. Yeah, it's difficult to say. Of course, the last few years, we've always been quite competitive there. So I hope we can be competitive again. But we'll pay attention to detail, you know, to try and optimise the car. And hopefully, yeah, we can fight for a win there again. I mean, it's never straightforward. I think in the first stint as well, you know, with Lando being there, honestly, I think the gap has been between 1.6 and 1.9 seconds, the whole stint, which you can't afford to make a mistake. And he didn't, I didn't, and we were just pushing flat out at one point. And it was honestly really enjoyable to drive because, of course, most of the races that we do, the tyres deg and you have to manage a lot. It felt like here you could push a bit harder and the track as well, the layout, I enjoy a lot. The grip is very good on the track. So yeah, that was a great stint. Then, of course, the second stint was a bit more stop-start with the Safety Cars involved and then of course the temperature as well in the tyres was very tricky because my middle restart wasn't particularly great. I tried something else but the grip was… The tyres basically were too cold, so I just kept on sliding and having no traction. So that was not ideal. Besides that, the pace was good. A dry race like this for us has been a long time, so I'm very happy with the improvements that we made compared to the start of the weekend. Yeah, I mean, the last few races in the dry, we haven't been particularly strong on managing the tyres. And that's why I was a little bit careful after qualifying. But yeah, it's been nice. I mean, it's still not where I would like it to be in terms of the behaviour of the car compared to, let's say, last year. But at least now, you know, we are back in a fight to win races. So if we can just learn from this year's car, take the positives, of course, from also last year and try to build a better car, I'm sure that we can be again very competitive next year. It's probably been one of the biggest, yeah, where you're fighting Haas in the sprint to fighting for the win in the main race. So, yeah, it's been quite a big swing in performance. It's not about confidence. It's just trying to understand this year's car a little bit more, what it needs. Because we know what the limitations are on the car. And it's about what we can do to make it better for next year. But of course, this was again a bit, maybe not an eye opener, but it did show us like, ‘oh, OK, well, that works on this car’ and it made it a lot more competitive. Most of the first stint, I felt quite good in the first two sectors. But then in the final sector, I think Lando already started pushing a bit more from the beginning of the race. And I was managing probably a little bit more. But then at one point, of course, he tried to close the gap and I had to push also harder in the last sector. But I think still he was being very quick also in the last corner, which has been a little bit of a weakness for us, even in qualifying. So, yeah, it just evened out around the lap, almost every single lap. So, yeah, it was nice. I enjoyed it. It's just, you know, making sure that you don't make any mistakes. Honestly, I mean... I couldn't believe that I got it. But in a way, I was also like, yeah, I'm not surprised anymore in the world that I live in. So, yeah. You're not happy with it. But at one point or another, you have to just turn the page. But, yeah, it wasn't very enjoyable to see that happen, because I think that's the first time that in a slow lap someone has been penalised. While, actually, I just tried to be nice. So maybe I shouldn't be nice. But the thing is that, you know, well, being nice, because at the end of the season, everything is more or less decided, for me especially, I didn't want to screw anyone over to prepare their lap. And by doing that, you know, being nice, basically you get a penalty. And that's what I tried to explain as well. But I just felt like I was talking to a brick wall. So there's not much that was possible for whatever reason. Well, I think I really spoke about valid reasons of what happened and it was clear cut that around me there were different scenarios going on as well, with people having colder tyres and stuff so they had to push anyway and I didn't want to then cause a scene into a last corner. and then, you know, no one had a lap. So very, very surprising. And then the second part of the question. Yeah, I was quite surprised when sitting there in the Stewards’ room, what was all going on. Honestly, very disappointing because I think we're all here, we respect each other a lot and of course, I've been in that meeting room many times in my life, in my career with people that have raced and I've never seen someone trying to screw someone over that hard. And that for me… I lost all respect. It was a bit difficult to see, to be honest, what it was. I didn't even know it was a mirror. Of course, I saw the debris, but we have done more races where there has been a bit of debris offline. So I guess it's a bit of a tough call to make. But then I think at one point a car drove over it. And then, of course, there are like carbon bits flying everywhere. And of course, I don't know what the reason is, of course, of the punctures, but it's maybe something to analyse. But at the moment, it's a bit difficult for me to give a clear cut opinion on that. Well, I mean, I knew that I lifted because I saw the double yellow. And I know that, of course, if I wouldn't have lifted, it would have been investigated straight away. So you're just on it. I mean, yeah, I asked if he lifted because he had a DRS, I think, from a backmarker at the same time as well. And then, of course, when we came out of Turn 1, I saw that he was a lot closer. So I just asked the team to check it. I mean, it was just a normal question. And I know, of course, with double yellows, they're quite strict.",Qatar,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yes. Yeah, not the position we were hoping for after yesterday and today, but the maximum we could do, for sure. My lap was pretty good. I was pretty happy with the lap. Just not quick enough comparing to the others. So happy with the lap, happy I got everything out of it. Not happy with the result. Yes. I mean, everyone saw how close it was between all of us for the whole of qualifying, so not a lot in it between all of us, which gives us hope that we can still go forward. um but there are some very quick cars behind us at the same time. I think we look forward to it. I think we showed good race pace today. I did have the benefit of being out front and being in clean air, which is a beautiful thing. But I expect a tougher race tomorrow, yeah. Of course. Yes, that was something completely separate. So, excited. I mean, I think we still have a good chance. I don't think we're as quick as the Mercedes. And I mean, Red Bull showed how much they improved from yesterday, you know. So, yes, plenty of opportunity for everyone. Yeah, I just made one mistake on my first push. I just dipped a wheel into the gravel. So yeah, my first mistake really of all of the qualifying and the whole weekend so far really. So I was bound to happen at some point, but not ideal. Then a little bit of traffic, not traffic, but just a little bit of some dirty air and that just upset my first push. So I backed out of it and went again for the final push. But I'm honestly pretty happy. I think my lap was good. In terms of result, obviously not very happy, but I feel like I got everything out of it. So I'm happy with that. I don't think we were expecting a step. The car was already mint in FP1 and we couldn't really get anything out of it. So I think that's what we've done a lot of times this year is we're very good at just coming to the weekend and the car's quick from the off. We put it straight away in sweet spot. I think what Red Bull and Max showed is that not every team can do that. And I think that's a strength from us. But they showed how much they struggled yesterday and how much just a few little tweaks to the car, how much that can make a difference to go from where he was yesterday to where he was today. So I think we just got a lot out of it yesterday. I did a good lap and I was happy. Today, same again, but when I'm on pole yesterday by whatever the gap was to George, five hundredths or something, six hundredths. That's not like we're way quicker, he's slower. That's like within the noise of a couple laps that you get to do. And today, George was ahead and Max was ahead again. So I don't think we may be quite at the pace comparing to them, especially today. But hopefully tomorrow we can get something back. I mean, I hope we're way quicker than them tomorrow. So I don't expect anything special. I think the clean air that I had earlier today made us look probably a bit better than we were. I don't think we've necessarily been the quickest to be honest this weekend, I think Mercedes have so expecting a tough battle and excited to see what we can do. I would like to give the guys ahead a little battle tomorrow and of course go forward. Our target would be to try and win the race but these two guys have probably going to make my life pretty tough tomorrow. Thanks. I mean, my lap was probably just as good, if anything, a bit better than it was yesterday. It's more these guys did a better job. More than anything, you know, I think to see Red Bull slow yesterday was the surprise. Probably not to see them quick today is not the surprise. They've not really had a bad race the whole year, they've always been there or thereabouts, so to see them as far off as they were yesterday was a bit of a shock. To see them back where he is now is probably not the shock. Both my laps were good, I think. We're losing a good amount in the straights comparing to the others. It was close to a tenth to both George and Max before we even get to Turn 1. So there's some little losses, of course, that's really downforce. And we hope to gain a little bit back in the high speed, but because it's almost flat, we never got back almost what we were losing in the straights. So possibly not in the perfect window of downforce. And on a day like today, you could probably get away with taking some off because you kind of just get to that limit where you don't gain anything more in the high speed. But hopefully tomorrow that falls back into our hands just a little bit. So both my laps were good, especially today. I don't think I could have got a lot more out of it. I didn't think I could even do a seven, to be honest. So I was happy to get that out of it too.",Qatar,post-qualifying,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean, it's been a great run so far. The last four qualifyings we've been on the front row every one, which I don't think we could have dreamt of a few races ago, so feeling in such a groove at the moment, feeling really great. My first lap was one of the best I've ever done. And then, for whatever reason, just couldn't find that extra bit of time on the last lap, and Max pipped me. But just taking the positives, the car's been so great the last two weekends, and just enjoying it while we can. You tell me. You're the expert. I mean, I ended up going through the gravel. all over the floor, through the floor. So it felt like the floor was scraping over that kerb and through the gravel. So I hope it didn't damage it. Maybe that's the reason why we didn't improve. I don't know. But it was a bit of a hairy one, two corners before we start the lap. Yeah, I mean, these have been three really great races for us. I think Brazil, a little bit circumstantial with the wet qualifying on the Sunday morning. But the pace last week in Vegas was true. The pace here this weekend is real as well, but it's so close out there. But it just is nice to be in the mix at the front once again. Yeah, I mean, just excited. Hopefully we can have a proper race rather than this team orders stuff. So, no, it's going to be a good race. I think we'll all be going for it. It's actually great that Max is in the mix as well. I was really surprised at their turnaround because they looked really off the pace yesterday, off the pace this morning. And obviously they were both in Q3 and Max on pole. So I think we've got a good race on our hands. No, not really. To be honest, my first lap was really strong. I was really pleased with that. I think it was a couple of tenths clear. And then I just didn't improve on that last lap. Obviously, I had a really scrappy out lap with the near collision with Max, and I ended up going through the gravel two corners prior to opening my lap. So it was not a good start. So that was probably the 55 milliseconds. It's great to be in this groove at the moment, four front row starts in a row, which has been really pleasing considering where we were three or four races ago. And the race pace this morning looked great. So Max did a great job. Red Bull seemed to turn it around a little bit since yesterday, but let's see what tomorrow brings. Well, I think these last two races, the circuits have played in our favour. We know when we can get the car low and stiff on a smooth track, it works pretty well. Brazil, we didn't actually have the pace. You know, we were very slow in the Sprint, in the Sprint qualifying, but of course it was a wet qualifying on the Sunday morning, so that evened things out a little bit. So I think we flattered ourself a bit in Brazil, but these last two races, when we really, analyse it. I don't think it's a surprise. the car is performing as well as it has shown. Yeah, it's going to be exciting. I mean, those inside starting positions were really tricky. I think every driver on the right-hand side made a poor start and that ultimately cost me the chance to fight with Lando. Now, obviously, Max up front, I think it's going to be a really close fight between, I mean, all four teams. Ferrari looked on the same pace as Lando and myself this morning. So, I mean, I hope it's going to be a good one, but the tyres seem pretty resilient. Maybe we'll see another DRS train, I don't know. I was following my delta, so it was, yeah. I didn't want to get penalised because we're told to follow the delta, so… Excuse me. It's probably about one and a half cars length difference from the inside all the way to turn one. We normally judge it based on distance in four seconds, and we think it's probably about four metres different left to right. It's, yeah, I mean, it's quite a big difference here. I hope the guys tonight or the track can clean it a bit because it was pretty clear in the sprint that everyone on that right side made bad starts and that's obviously a little bit unfair to have those circumstances.",Qatar,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, crazy. I mean, honestly, I also didn't expect that. But yeah, well done to the team, you know, to give me a car that feels a bit more connected. And once the car is a bit more together, you can push harder and it felt a lot better out there in qualifying for me. I mean, we did change a bit on the car, but I never thought it would make such a swing in performance. So that's promising. I hope, of course, it also lasts more in the race. I don't know that yet, but it just felt already a lot more stable over one lap, and that's exactly what we need. And, yeah, very happy to be on pole. It's been a while. Yeah, it's going to be a tough race, I think, physically, but I think also mainly on the tyres, just making sure that you're good on them. You know, the front left around here gets eaten up quite a lot, so it's all about managing that tomorrow, but I hope that with the setup that we have on the car now, it will be a bit better. It's all very close behind, and you could see in the Sprint, well, I mean, Mercedes, McLaren and Ferrari, they were all quick, and now it seems like we are in that mix, and I hope tomorrow as well. Yeah, I mean, quite different. Just felt a bit more hooked up on entry, mid-corner, like everything that was bad before improved quite a lot. So I felt it straight away from lap one that, yeah, it all just felt a bit more consistent. And that's exactly what we needed to be a bit more competitive. No, I think from the first lap in Q1, it felt a lot more promising, but then to get the tyres in the right window is very tough. So then it went away a little bit, then it came back again. And then, yeah, luckily for Q3, I think it was there. And yeah, very happy with how we turned it around. Yeah, for sure. I mean, I did think that maybe we could improve the car a little bit, but not like this. That's for sure. Yeah, it's still a bit of a question mark. I did feel that yesterday we were not too far off in qualifying, and then I felt like we were quite far off in the Sprint. So this is great, to be on pole, but I'm not sure yet if it's going to be enough to really be the outright fastest, but we'll find out tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, it was very good. I felt confident in the car, so I was pushing it. And honestly, the whole lap was hundredths here, then two hundredths and then the last corner a little bit. It was not a lot compared to the previous lap, but it was just everywhere a little bit better. Of course, naturally there is a little bit less feel in the car because I only did one run. That helps. So, yeah, it was all pretty close, but it felt just a lot more connected for me. And, yeah, that was definitely necessary. And then you can attack the corners a bit more. And that gave us pole position. Well, I mean, it couldn't have been worse. So we just looked at it. And I mean, it's not all super clear, but we're like, well, we have to go and try this direction. We put it on the car and it worked. And of course, you know, a lot of people back at the factory analysing a lot of stuff already throughout the whole weekend. But at the end of the day, yeah, you have to make the decisions also on track if you want to do it or not. Simulator is running in the background as well. And yeah, a miracle happened! Already a step in a direction, and I think then we went a bit more aggressive on it, I would say. Yeah, there were two cars in front of me also making a gap, so I had to make a gap. And I knew that everyone was on a slow lap, not on a push lap. Yeah. And then I think George got excited. He wanted to pass and get around. That's fine. I mean, everyone, of course, tries to get their position, you know, to have the best possible start to the lap. Next time just drive straight through!",Qatar,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"I don't want to go back to what happened in Vegas. Yeah, I mean, last two races of the season and we need to do absolutely everything in order to get that Constructors' Championship. That's all that matters. And whatever happened in Vegas, we discussed about it and we are all good, which is the most important thing. I had no doubts about that because we've always had a really good relationship with Carlos and we've had races where sometimes things don't go exactly the way we want, but the most important thing is that we discuss about it and we go forward. It's very clear for both of us that we just want to win the Constructors’ and it's by working as a team that we'll achieve that. And I'm sure that there won't be any problems with it. Exactly. I think that realistically here, it's going to be a bit more of a difficult weekend. However, it's a Sprint weekend as well. And if we do things really right from the first few laps and the car is in the right place from the first laps in FP1, it can make a big difference and much bigger than any of the car characteristics we may have seen or anticipate for the weekend. So I think that on paper it doesn't seem like it's going to be our strongest track. However, things can still turn our way and we are super motivated to prove us wrong. I think if we compare this one to the previous years, we've done a good job in maximising the points and minimising the loss in races where we have struggled as a team. And that's a really positive thing, which I think in the past wasn't necessarily the case. I think,  as a team, we were a lot more vulnerable to what was happening around the team and it was making us going a bit up and down, emotionally speaking, and now we are a lot more solid. That doesn't mean that it's good enough yet because obviously, as a matter of fact, we've lost the Drivers' Championship last weekend, or even before, but we are a more solid team and we are going in the right direction. So I think it's been a positive season and we are going into the right direction. Nothing special, but at the end, I don't even need that. As I said, we have a really good relationship with Carlos. And sometimes I have overstepped the lines, and sometimes he did. And then it only requires a discussion between us two. And we look ourselves in the eye, and we know each other since a very long time now. We understand each other very, very quickly. So I have no doubts. Sometimes we need these kind of things to reset a little bit and I have no doubts that going into the last race of the season there won't be any problems or whatsoever because at the end it's in the benefit for both of us to try and win that constrictors we know that an opportunity like that doesn't happen very often and we've got to do absolutely everything on both of our side in order to try and win that. And we need each other in order to win that because it's not going to be easy. This weekend is not going to be easy. And by working as a team, we can maybe achieve that. At the end, I always say the second is the first of the losers. And you never really are excited about a second or a third or a fourth place. However, having said that, obviously second place in a year like this would mean a lot in a way because I think it's not been an easy year. The priority remains the Constructors’. However, the second place in the Drivers’ would be a nice bonus. So it's not like I don't care at all. But it will be a good thing to be finishing second after a year like this. I find it very, very difficult to judge. I mean, it's not like we actually know how much work there is for these three categories. I mean, at least personally, I don't know that. So, yeah, I think it's very, very difficult to judge whether that is too much or not. I guess he will be the first one to experience it. But the first race has gone really well. And he's been super open-minded in listening to us drivers and doing things in the right way. And that was very positive. But concerning the workload, I think it's very difficult to judge or to say anything from our side. I mean, Max is a very special driver. And I think what makes him very special is also the confidence that he has. However, I think it's very difficult to say something like that not knowing actually what the car is like. Yeah, he's an incredible driver. No doubts whether he will have made it or not. I don't know. I don't know how the Red Bull is. I don't know how the McLaren is. And he doesn't know how the Ferrari is. So it's maybe a bit of a stretch to say something like that. But yeah, nothing to add. I've said it many times. On one hand, it's not like I'm going to miss him like crazy because he will still be in the paddock, maybe 20 metres away. So as I've said it for Fréd, Carlos isn't my girlfriend either. And so I really like Carlos, but I'm sure we'll spend still a lot of time together. And as I was saying earlier, we have a really good relationship that will stay there even after our relationship within Ferrari. Yeah, we won't be working any more together, but we'll still spend time together. But he is a good person and we get along very, very well. And yeah, that, as I said earlier, helps us to work together very well. No, I don't think so. We have a very good relationship too. It's a different kind of relationship because I haven't spent that much time with Lewis yet, but I have obviously so much respect for Lewis and what he has achieved. And we have had a very good relationship. We don't have quite the same age, but we still share a lot of interest outside racing. So, no, I'm sure it won't be any different.",Qatar,thursday,Ferrari
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, it was a pretty nice qualifying. I think, overall, the last few weekends have been… We've been in a better shape since Austin. We brought some new parts, we've managed to get to Q3 the last four weekends and it seems like we found quite a nice flow. I think in Vegas we just made the best out of the conditions. It was quite tricky, street track, very cold. Got in a nice place with the car. And when we got to Q3, we had a single lap, but we really managed to put everything to it. And yeah, it put us in a great place. So it was a great achievement, especially looking back at Bahrain, first race of the year, I lined up in 20th, you know. We were absolutely nowhere. So when you look at all the evolution and development, it definitely shows we're heading in the right direction and it's definitely positive. Yeah, I think we can be confident. We are in the fight for sixth in the championship. We know the target. We know who we're fighting. Haas and AlphaTauri (sic) are also competitive. They've shown to be in that top ten most of the last few races. And it's going to be a tight fight, but I expect an exciting one. So I'm sure we'll be in the mix. And I'm looking forward to these last two weekends. I would say it was a very disappointing start of the season. We expected it. We had a rough winter, didn't manage to get the car in the place we wanted to start in Bahrain. But once you get the tools you have at the start of the year, you've got to work your best way with it. And I must have been very impressed with the team in the way they've managed to turn things around. The understanding, spotting where [are] the limitations of the car, finding solutions to it. And I must say I'm definitely more confident than ever into going to ‘25 with a clear idea of where we're heading, the changes we're going to make. I definitely believe the car is going to be in a much better place to start with. And yeah, it just brings confidence to all of us. So there have been a lot of changes. I think a lot of positive changes internally, which are not very obvious from the outside. But I think we're shaping up a much better team start of ‘25 compared to where we were a couple of months ago. Yeah, I mean, there's still big, big work ahead. You know, like looking at the top four, it still feels like they are in a different league, especially come race day. But yeah, it will be definitely starting, hoping, to close that gap and hopefully see us able to fight more consistently in the top ten and hopefully in the top five on some occasions. I think I fully agree with Charles. As he said, I think the first race weekend has been very positive, very objective and open for discussion and very factual as well. So I'm sure whatever comes out of this weekend, if it doesn't allow him to be at a F1 standard, I'm sure there'll be changes in the future. So at the minute, yeah, we'll see. But as I say, it's been a good start and we'll see how it goes the next two weekends. I mean, it's exciting. It's going to be my first time to race with 22 cars in F1. So, yeah, more rivals, probably more action, more racing. So, yeah, exciting, exciting times. And as Fernando said, I think it's been a long topic for quite a long time. So I'm sure if they came to that conclusion, definitely means it's the best for the sport. So, yeah, excited about it.#
CL: Yeah, very similar reply. It's the first time in my career that I'll be 22 on the grid in F1, and that's exciting. I also think that there are lots of young drivers waiting for a place in Formula 1, in order to get there, and that will obviously give more opportunities to very talented young drivers that are dreaming to get into Formula 1. So for that, this is a good thing, and yeah, cool to have two more cars on the grid. It's a tough question. I think performance-wise, he deserves a chance. He seems to have improved a lot from the moment he came. He's been performing pretty strongly, I would say, this season and also last year. He’s beaten his teammate. From this point of view, I think, yeah, looking at the programme, the Red Bull programme, it will make sense to give him a shot. But, you know, at the end, ultimately, we know there is not only performance that comes down to that decision. It's a top team. And, yeah, it depends on what Christian and Helmut wants to do with it. Personally, yeah, I'd like to see him and see what he does there. But I know it's not that easy. And if you ask me performance-wise, yeah, I think he deserved a chance.",Qatar,thursday,Alpine
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, it goes up and down for everybody. Difficult to be sure of that, but I think we didn’t manage to improve the car much throughout the season. So we started quite strong, but we are now in a position that we're struggling to be in Q3 on some occasions. But yeah, at the same time, all those difficulties, I think, probably are teaching us a lot of lessons, which we will apply into next year's car. And that will be probably the biggest positive aspect of the second part of the year, you know, that even if we didn't succeed in putting much performance on the car, I think it's well understood what we are struggling with at the moment. So that will be applying in 2025. Yeah, I think even before that, I think Baku and Singapore were just good Sundays, thanks to a good qualifyings on Saturday, street circuits, we maximised, I think, the opportunities there. And some of our rivals, you know, maybe didn't perform to perfection there. So, yeah, I think after the summer break, we've been struggling a little bit, but the team is still working flat out to bring upgrades. And as I said, even if not all of them, you know, succeed to race in the following weekends, I think there is a clear understanding now of where the path is into next year's car. So yeah, that's the aim. Yeah, definitely. I think Vegas was difficult to understand the car and the low temperatures and to get the grip, the confidence, high speed. The walls are very close. But then on Sunday, already in the laps to the grid, the car felt much more alive. And on the race itself, I think we gained some positions and we were happier. So yeah, I left Vegas thinking that I want to jump in the car again. and try. So yeah, tomorrow in FP1 I will be happy. Well, that will be a very nice thing to try, you know, to be in a position to fight for the World Championship. At the moment, we are not in that position, and next year probably is going to be difficult. But hopefully in ‘26, with the new rules, we'll have a better chance to try at least. And yeah, so far Max has proven, you know, not having weak points, basically, and he has been always delivering the job on Sundays and scoring, you know, so many points when the car was good, but so many points when the car was not good as well. And that's the strength, you know, to win a championship. And yeah, you always think that if you have a chance, maybe things could be more difficult for him. Yeah, interesting question. Probably I have to think a little bit deeper. But no, I don't think that the pleasure of driving is linked to the performance only. Sometimes you come to a circuit or to even a go-kart track, and you are alone on track, and you are not fighting anyone. And you have a lot of joy, and you have a real good day. Sometimes you have a car that is not really well set up or you have a huge understeer or we all, as I said now, you jump in a rental car that you just self-steer to the left or whatever, or it's just not really square, the chassis, and you still have a lot of fun just fighting against that weakness of the car you know and trying to make the car turn the same way, left to right, in some corners. So I think it's just overcoming the challenge sometimes of what the car is able to do, which produces satisfaction and joy in driving. And I think the adrenaline and the freedom when you are behind the wheel of choosing what to do, at what speed you want to approach the corner, when you want to brake, 30 metres later, 30 meters earlier. So all those kind of decisions that you make by instinct is a sense of freedom that I think increases the joy of driving whatever car. So I don't think it's related to performance. And then comparing different eras of Formula 1, for sure, I think the early 2000s were the best cars to drive. They were very light, very reactive. I think the feedback that you get from the car when you have less sophisticated tools is much more pure than what we have now, that is all filtered a little bit by all the technology we have. So yeah I still think that those cars were more fun to drive. Yeah, not much to add. Only he knows if it's too much or not. Or probably he will know after the weekend, not even now. Yeah, I mean, 11th team, 22 drivers, it’s not the first time that we will be 22 on the grid. It's a complex decision, I guess, for the sport in general but if they came to that conclusion it's because it's the best for everybody. I will support always whatever management thing that is the best. And then for the team personnel, yeah, they have a couple of people that they were in the Renault days and for sure they will have a huge contribution right now at the very early part of the project, with a lot of experience in Formula 1 and in the sport. So, yeah, I wish the best of luck, you know. A new team is never an easy task, but I think they will be well prepared and they have the right people. So, yeah, welcome. Yeah, it has been challenging, but I still enjoyed a lot this year, especially at the beginning, obviously, when the car was a little bit faster. But even now, you know, with the difficulties we face sometimes, we're still trying to analyse and get some lessons into the next year's car and into the future. And yeah, when you start the season strong and then you finish with a little bit more struggles, you have the sense of, you know, you finish so you had a so-so season. And when you do the opposite, it's a very different feeling when you finish strong. But the points are counting after Abu Dhabi. And I think we have a high chance to finish fifth in the Constructors’ Championship, which is not what we want to be. But I have the feeling that, you know, there is a perception that there are a lot of teams that they did better than Aston Martin this year and they are well behind us. As I said, you know, it depends if you start strong or you finish weak or vice versa. But, you know, we are not where we want to be. But there are only four teams happier than us, not nine. No, I don't think that the expectations were too high. We did a very strong campaign in 2023, and people were expecting us to fight for bigger things, or at least to be at the level that we were at the beginning of this year. And this is normal. This is Formula 1, and we want to be there as well. You know, we didn't succeed, you know, the second part of the year. We are aware of that. But we are not ashamed of that. You know, we are working towards fighting for the championship in the future and the second part of the year we didn't maybe bring to the circuit what we thought that it was in the pipeline. But at the same time, we have finished, as you said, some of the facilities in Silverstone, with building two and three of the factory, the wind tunnel will be soon operating. And we have Adrian Newey on board, so. It was not a bad 2024. I don't know much. I don't know exactly what will be the characteristics of the car. As I said before, all the learnings that we are taking into this year's, you know, the struggles, I think are well in place into next year's project. So, you know, all the things that we didn't succeed this year, I think they are better for next year. I don't think that the car will be the base of 2023. I don't think so. I think it's just a completely new project for ‘25 which hopefully delivers better results than the current car. But we are aware of also the gap with the top four teams. They are in a little bit in another league. So, you know, I think there is a lot of work to do, but there's still four months or three months and a half until the first race and first proper test. So I think we have plenty of time and we have the right people. We have the right facilities and we have the good learnings of this year. So, you know, I'm confident to start the season strong and to have a good 2025.",Qatar,thursday,Aston Martin
Alex Albon,"Yeah, not smooth for sure. I think being especially tough more for the mechanics and for the people at the factory. Obviously, we had a few crashes, not always our fault, but in the end, they add up. And testament to everyone who's worked so hard to get them back, we still got two cars that are at the track that are more than capable to score points and back to fighting fit, at least the cars are. It's been tough, but everyone's been very strong, very optimistic, and I think that's Williams. I think everyone's very optimistic. But also, I don't think I've finished a race since Baku! I think maybe I have. I honestly... Austin? Did I finish Austin? I finished Austin with a broken floor, so it's almost like we haven't really done anything. I mean, Mexico, we were P8. Brazil, we were P2 until the incident, P3 until the incident. Vegas, we got caught out by Safety Cars. So I really think it's nowhere near as bad as maybe it looks like on the outside. I think we've just had a tough run and that happens. It's not normal to have it consecutive, as much as it has happened for us so far this year, at least in this last part of the year. But yeah, it's just how it is, unfortunately. Yes, partly. I think that last year we finished P7 in the Constructors' Championship and I wouldn't say we were always the seventh quickest car. I think we really took advantage and made the most of what we had. This year feels in some ways the opposite, I would agree. I think that we've been on the back foot since race one. I think we didn't quite have the... I think it's a known story now, the car wasn't on weight and we were on the back foot from the beginning and then we missed out on capitalising when we should have. Teams like Alpine, they're on their third, fourth upgrade now. We did one major one, I would say, this year, and let's say where we are now is kind of expected in terms of pace. but I think we've just missed out a little bit. All for good reasons, though. I really think that a lot of the reasons why we've been on the back foot is just because we've made so many big changes back at Grove, which are going to help us definitely in the future, but possibly a little bit of short-term pain for now. Truthfully, not too much. I wish I could say more, but I think, obviously, once Abu Dhabi happens, firstly, I'll be very keen to hear his feedback on the car during the test, see where his head’s at compared to Ferrari. I think, obviously, he'll have a very fresh mind of driving the Ferrari and then coming into Williams of where are our strengths? Where are our weaknesses? And yeah, I think that's honestly one of the things that I'm looking forward to most with Carlos joining is I remember my time at Red Bull and when I came to Williams and obviously there's a lot of things on your mind, things you want to try to improve for the team. And at the same time, I've spent now three years at Williams, and it's nice to almost have someone a little bit fresher than me. And coming from a team like Ferrari, I'm sure he'll bring a lot to the table. And of course, I know he will push me. I think he's having a very strong year this year as well. But it will be a good challenge. I think Franco tried it in Brazil, but it was quite cold in Brazil. So it didn't work. I think it made him too cold, actually. So he asked to take it off before FP1. So in that sense, it must work. But I think it's great that they're taking initiatives to try to help us. Obviously, as you said, it's maybe not that hot this weekend, but it's still going to be physical. And so, yeah, I mean, in hot races, hot climates, especially with all the travel we're doing and the toll it's taking on our bodies, if there's any extra support we can get, then I think we would definitely take them. Last year was very not comfortable, I think, for the drivers that did race. And yeah, I think all good steps.",Qatar,thursday,Williams
Zhou Guanyu,"For me, I think it's more about the upgrades. These upgrades, I think, we wanted for a while now. And, obviously, finally to have that for both cars for the first time in a while as well in Vegas, that was a pretty good step on the team. And, yeah, it's clearly, we saw in terms of numbers, it's probably the biggest one we had this season for all this new stuff we had. And it's clearly worked like we hoped. Is it enough or not? We will find out a little bit more this weekend and also Abu Dhabi. But I think it's clearly a very positive step in the right direction. Tried them in FP2 had a good comparison from P1 and everything just seems to be working in the right direction. and yeah had a good weekend I think after a very difficult last couple of weeks. I think for us at this stage, we need a little bit of luck because I think, like one of the Racing Bulls and also both Haas look very strong this year. And then there's several teams, you know, like Alpine and Williams, they can be always there. So it's very difficult compared to last year, because last year you have like some teams has always been up there and some other teams have been struggling more than the others. But this year seems to be the midfield is very consistent in a positive way that for us it's difficult to do the catch up. But I think we're there, you know, where if we put a car or both cars in Q2, then everything still can be happening for the race. But I think we do need a bit of luck. And then purely on just car performance, I think we are not yet had a quick enough car for top 10, but we can be there like we did last week. Yeah, I mean, I liked it. I enjoy this track layout, you know. I like more high-speed tracks, and then this track is a lot of medium high-speed corners, which goes a little bit towards my favourites. But last year was good. But I remember, you know, as good as the results we had here, but it's all about how intense, how demanding the whole race was. That's all I can remember, left off from Qatar. But, yeah. You know we try to focus on what we are doing this year. It’s a completely different concept of the car, so things can be definitely pan out a little bit differently, but we keep the hopes high. I think we saw very positive steps in the previous weekend and then we try to keep that momentum up and then hopefully that I can find more rhythm than what I did over the last few weeks and just continue to be, you know, getting better together as a team. For sure not. I mean, I was thinking that was a very good start point, but I didn't expect that's actually the best result we had. Yeah, we're facing a lot of unexpected challenges for the season. I think it's very difficult for every single, I think, members in the team because, like I always mentioned, the first part of the season, the first five, six races, I think me and Valtteri, we had several occasions that we can be quite good at points, and then we had this pit stop issue, which got massively delayed until we fixed that into the European races, unfortunately. And since there we didn't really have the performance in the car to be fighting back in the points like we did in the previous few weekends. So it's been very tough, I guess. As a driver, you cannot pay the end result because of that season that everything can be very possible for the future. So, yeah, right now, like I always said, it's a relief, but I still want to finish this journey together with the team in the best way as possible. I think it's been a very family feeling together with Sauber over the last two and a half years and to this point. And then, yeah, let's see what the future is. But right now, I'm just trying to enjoy as much as I could with the next coming races. Yeah, actually, we haven't actually tried anything yet. So I wouldn't really give much opinion on that. But I think I'm more than happy, of course, to have this cooling just to help. I think races like Singapore every single year has been very difficult for drivers, losing a lot of water. And I think that will just only help us. So yeah, let's see. Yeah, I mean, I'm fully aware of, you know, that GM and also Cadillac joined the grid. I think it's very good for the sport in general because, you know, a lot of people are always talking about having probably not enough seats for the people, the young drivers available. Clearly, I think we have a lot of young drivers for next year. And then, I think from my position, it's a great opportunity and a great chance for next season that I'm not having a seat. So I can probably think about what the future will be and try to have an opportunity there. So I'm aware of that. But everything was just only announced this week. We need to still go through a bit more further details on that. But for me, my priority is trying to, like I always said, having another chance of coming back on the grid. So for me, I don't really have where I go, but if there's a chance to grab, I will absolutely take it. So let's see how the future is. Actually, you know, next year for me, I kind of decided not to take another series, just because I feel like with so many doors that could be potentially open, not just during next year, but also the year after, I want to make sure if there's a chance for me in case, you know, to be stepping back into seat for one race or not, but I'll be fully here to do so. So that's very important. But I also do feel like, we talk about, you know, you want to keep the momentum of racing going on. But if you take this one year off, I think you'll be OK on that. I think more than one year, then you start to have a little bit of losing this momentum. So for me, I think I'll be just making sure, I mean, in the next chapter, in a very happy place, that I can you know be fully aware that having a possibility to return here on the grid because I think this year didn't really show my full potential yet. I want to have definitely another chance if there's an occasion on that. So let's see.",Qatar,thursday,Sauber
Sergio Pérez,"I think in Vegas mainly the main issue we had was qualifying. We were out in Q1. Straight away after qualifying we understood why. We saw it, it was very clear in the data. But then we were on the back foot and then going on to the race, with the degradation that we had, we were not expecting it to be so severe, especially in the beginning. So we went for the Hard tyre. which I also degraded the Hard tyre and that meant that I had to spend quite a lot of the race on the Medium, so it compromised the race a lot, but we did have some good pace during the race. I think with the set-up we are coming closer. Already in a couple of weekends, São Paulo, probably in Vegas we didn't have the pace that we had in São Paulo, but I think there are some promising signs that things are coming. We were not so competitive in Vegas in terms of team order, but I believe that here should be a good track for us. Yeah, obviously, it's been one of my best starts of the year, you know, with four races. consecutively on the podium. Things were looking great. But as soon as we came back to Europe, I think our season took a U-turn. Other teams improved and found a lot of performance. On our side, we got a bit lost with the car, I'll say. And then there were a lot of weekends where things were just not coming in, a lot of weekends have been too difficult just in regards that we are looking at all the areas, exploring all the areas, and at the end of the day there is only so much you can do on a weekend that we end up losing a lot of points and the season turned out to be quite a lot more difficult. But I think it's how it is in Formula 1. Sometimes things don't go your way. We’re still here and and optimistic that we can turn things around as a team, especially for next year. I think it's hard to say, actually, because the way the car changed meant that we had to drive quite differently, and it took me a lot longer to adapt. And actually, as a team, to understand what the car was doing, it took us a lot of races, because sometimes it's not so clear to spot issues on the data and then to drive around them. So I think I was a lot more sensitive to it with my driving style than, for example, Max was. You know, for Max, things didn't change that much. But for me, it changed severely. So it's hard to say what we could have done differently. I think spotting the problems early will have helped quite a lot our season. Yeah, I think it's very difficult for people to understand that they're not part of the team or are not on a daily basis. From one race to another, let's say you are so far away. I think when you are not able to extract 100% out of your car, it's irrelevant how good your car is. And this is what happened. You know, I haven't been able to extract 100% out of my car because of the difficulties I've had in the last few months with it. And I think that's the main issue. You know, I think you go through periods and I think as a team, we are understanding and we're working really hard to make sure that we can fix them. I mean, at the end of the day, the team has all the information. There is so much I can say here. At the end of the day, the team has all the information. And there's a reason why we extended my contract during the year. At the end of the day, the team has everything, and we exactly know where we are in terms of performance, in terms of issues, difficulties that we've had. We are a team and we know exactly internally where everything stands, so we're working really hard as a team to come through and get back into a much better season than the one that we just had. I think Max has done his best season I've seen from him in these four years. I think the way he pushed the team, out of the car, how hard he worked during this year, especially there were a lot of periods during the year where we looked really far and he would push the team in all the areas, in all the aspects. Max has done very big steps out of the car. I think his talent and his speed has been there since day one, but out of the car, how he reads the races, how he works with the team, how he pushes the team, I think is the biggest step that he has done in these past years. I think we're working as a team. I think especially the last few months, we've had similar issues with the car, so we're pushing in similar directions to try and improve the car. And at the end of the day, we are working as a team. Like I say, you know, the team knows exactly what we've done, where we are, and I think we're working well together. I don't speak. I've been 14 years in the sport and I don't speak about my contracts publicly. So I will not comment on that. I know exactly where I am and I will not speak about it publicly. Yeah, I think there has been a few occasions in my career where things have gone quite to the limit. And I think the speeds that we're traveling, you don't want to see someone collapsing in the car or something like that. So I think it's a really, really good thing, a very good initiative. I haven't tried it. I haven't seen the system. So I don't know if it works. But yeah, hopefully we can do something for those sort of races like the one we had last year here.",Qatar,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"You tell me! I'm sure where you're going, it's going to be a good party. So I was planning on flying in a couple of hours, but I'm definitely not getting on that flight. And I'm going to enjoy this evening with all my team. It's been a dream of a weekend. I don't know how we've been so quick, but I'm just riding this wave right now. Vegas is just a crazy, crazy place. And when you're driving, you see all of this in the background. I can't even describe this place. So to get a victory here, pole position, dominant weekend, 1-2 with Lewis as well, we couldn't have chosen a better place to make this happen. I was just waiting for something to happen. You know, the two races I've been on pole before, it's always been chaos, rain, dry and always something happening, last race in Brazil you know with the red flag. So, I'm like, I feel confident here, I've got a good gap but I'm just waiting for something to happen and it didn't. So I guess luck has turned and yeah just so happy right now. Yeah, absolutely. It's been a real surprise seeing how strong our pace has been and securing the pole yesterday I was so pleased with. And then I think we won the race in stint one. To be honest, stint one was exceptional. And I knew from there on in the only way we would probably lose the victory is if I grained the tyres and opened them up. So it was just a case of managing my pace, managing in the right corners and bringing it home. Yeah, I think so. It's no secret that we struggle on the bumpy circuits and we have to lift the car quite a lot. We've got to make it much softer. And then we're in a downforce window where we don't have any. And it's not that we just suddenly forget how to set the car up. It's just certain circuits require us to put the car in a window it doesn't like to be. And on tracks like this where it's relatively smooth, we can get the car quite low, quite stiff, with little or no bumps around the track, we fly. I think we've got a good shot in Qatar, to be honest. Going into this triple header, I had my sights set on Qatar, even to the point that I wanted to take my freshest engine out and put an old engine in for Vegas, to save my best engine for Qatar. And I'm kind of glad we didn't do that now. I don't know, to be honest. I mean, I don't party that often. I don't know where I need to go, but I'll be going somewhere. This guy walking in will probably have a better idea than me. So where's the party? Yeah, exceptional. I mean, he had a dominant car at the start of the year and he got the wind when he needed to and then genuinely thought he probably wasn't going to win this championship. And he delivered week in, week out, and got the best result the car was capable of and his rivals didn't. And, you know, I thought it was going to go right to the wire. And, yeah, he won three (sic) races to go. So, you know, huge congrats to him. We just got to make sure that we get ourselves in that fight. And give him a harder time. Because it's about time, I think we feel ready to try and take that challenge to the front. I mean, there's not really anything you can do in these days. Preparation needed to happen beforehand. And it's going to be a challenge for everyone, but we're all in the same boat. So no one's going to be on peak condition personally, but it's just about limiting the losses. No, I really wanted to do it, but I was so cold after the race, I thought, like, I'm going to get super ill and this time last year I actually caught pneumonia and I was ill all the way into mid-February after Vegas and Abu Dhabi. So I was like, you know, in the moment I really wanted to do it, but then I was thinking back to the struggles I had this time 12 months ago because it's such a toll on the body. It's from all the champagne, to be honest, why I was soaking wet. I mean, obviously, it's not great timing at all for the people who are here in the moment. But we're 20 drivers, let's say 4,000 people who do all the F1 races collectively. And there's tens of millions of people who watch at home. So I'd probably say having it back-to-back with Qatar is the biggest challenge. If we have a week off afterwards, I'd say that's probably the only thing realistically that would help. Enjoy it, to be honest. It's such a special moment. Get into Formula 1, it's... For all of us it’s like every step of your journey, you're climbing a ladder. And when you reach F1, that's a huge step and huge pride. And sort of cherish those moments. The driving, to be honest, is probably the easiest part of the job. It's everything else that comes with Formula 1. There's a lot more attention versus F2. It's a big leap in that regard. But just enjoy it. Yeah, definitely. Nobody's unbeatable. And you go through these phases where teams and drivers together are dominating and people think if I went up alongside them, I wouldn't be able to compete with them. And you’ve got to have belief in yourself. I think, you know, the three of us here all believe in ourself. And for me personally, you know, when I teamed up with Lewis, Lewis is the greatest of all time. And, you know, Max is right up there with Lewis. So, Yeah, I absolutely believe in myself that we could fight him in equal machinery.",Las Vegas,post-race,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"That was great. Well, firstly, I've got to say a big congratulations to Max, winning the championship, still with several races to go. And if I'd done my job yesterday, it would have been a breeze today. but it's OK, I had fun coming from the back, coming from 10th and the team did a fantastic job. We don't know why we were so quick this weekend but that's the nice. That's the best the car has ever felt, so I'm grateful to have been a part of getting it to that point. The climate, it's just that the race is so late. So you're going to bed at 5, 6am, waking up and starting your day much later, which is quite difficult. So you don't get a lot of sun during the day, so that really messes with your rhythm. But otherwise, it's cold, yeah. And maybe the reason that we did so well is because it's cold. If we're in a hot climate, that's where we struggle the most. I mean if the car drives like that in the next couple races then I think we'll be in a good a good spot to challenge the guys up front. And the championship's done, so now it's just all out, fight for the best positions possible. We both looked a lot younger then didn't we? I have no clue, man! I had a great time. When you're progressing and moving forward, it's always a great feeling. It felt very much like my old days at Rye House, starting at the back and coming through, so it was great. Honestly, I don't really remember it. Best of recent [times], of course. We got a really good balance in the car today. It felt a lot better than it was yesterday, particularly Q3 yesterday, but yeah, just phenomenal for the team. It doesn't really matter, really, does it? At the end of the day, George did a great job, did everything he was supposed to do and I'm happy for him and I'm just grateful I could get back up there to support the team with a 1-2. I have no idea. I mean, I don't think anyone in the team knows why we were as quick as we were this weekend. And everyone will be happy about it. But I think often in the hotter conditions, we struggle more. When we go into two, maybe Qatar is not so bad because it's a little bit cooler there. And the track is very smooth. So maybe we'll not be too bad at that track. I think we were OK there last year. Abu Dhabi, maybe less so. But we'll see. He's done a fantastic job. He's not made any mistakes and he's delivered every time and every point he's supposed to. And him and his team have done the best job, again, fourth year in a row. And it definitely got exciting at one point. I think they will be hard to beat next year because they probably started earlier than everyone else developing next year's car as well. But yeah, really happy for him. Yeah, great, great performance. It's not that I didn't think I could do it. So, yeah, I've had many races like this, but I'm generally happy to have had the recovery. You know, it's a new day and I just tried to approach it with a positive mindset. and you know to be able to have a car underneath me today, and be able to push and overtake people was such a great feeling. That was honestly one of the most enjoyable races. Yeah, if I'd started pole and just led the way, wouldn't have felt as much fun, for sure. Of course, winning a Grand Prix is always a great thing, but when whoever it is faces adversity and has to battle through, it just feels so much better when you do succeed. Not really much more to add to that. Not a huge amount… Just get there as soon as you can. I think it's great. I mean the race is amazing, so really happy to… Yeah for sure the back-to-back is not the easiest. It's massively challenging for everyone here, and particularly for the people that work in the garages that are on their feet taking the car to pieces now, packing it up and shipping it over, and they won't get a lot of rest. So for them, it's definitely the hardest, but they love it, and I don't even think if you were to ask them to change it, they would do this 10 times over. But the actual race is absolutely fantastic. It's such a great event. They've really, really done a mega job this year. So I can't wait to come back next year. I don't know. Don't do absolutely everything everyone tells you to do. Ask lots of questions. Take your time. Don't let the negativity get to you because, you know, people are so negative nowadays judging you non-stop. So stay off social media and keep your family and your closest friends close to you because they are the only ones that are your true friends and they're going to be there for you when they go and get stuff. It really depends whether they have a second-and-a-half advantage at the first race again like they did this year. It's not about this year. We're talking about youngsters. We're talking about 18-year-olds. And I remember when I was 22 and you're thrown in a deep end. You've been given training as a young driver through the younger series, but you're not most of them. Probably don't have a PR person. The team will have a PR person, but they're not looking out for you. They're looking out for the team. And so you're thrown in the deep end and you're trying to be nice and people take advantage of you. And so my guidance, like if I had a young driver and I was looking after him, I would put a lot of support around him so that people can get to him. And the socials and media and stuff would not be able to affect that young individual's mindset. And I think that protecting that is really important. because then I think it's really about giving people, firstly, them getting the opportunity and not knocking them down when they make mistakes. Which one of you or anyone here, 18 years old, 19 years old, has not made mistakes? And it's just that when you do it in the spotlight, it's really, really, really tough. And so we should be lifting these people up and giving them not just one chance, two chances, just continue to support them and just not slating them because that's just not nice.",Las Vegas,post-race,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it was a bit of a shock, you know, the Mediums. I was expecting to be quite strong on this tyre, but I think it lasted something like eight, nine laps on me. And then from there onwards, it was just a damage limitation race. You know, I was not comfortable with the car, not strong today. I wish I would have been a bit quicker and would have been fighting with George for the win, but we just simply didn't have it in ourselves today. So we came back with a P3, a podium that is not enough for what we expected, but the maximum that we could do today. No, I was hoping that maybe Vegas had something to offer to me after what happened last year. I'll take a podium for this year as a bit of a vendetta (sic). But, you know, at the same time, yeah, I was looking at every manhole during that race, avoiding them this time. But, yeah, that's things of the past, now focused on the future. I think this race has delivered, again, a pretty good show and looking forward to come back here in the future. Yeah, and it's been like that for four years. Charles and I have gone wheel to wheel pretty much every, not every race weekend, but every two or three races because we share the same piece of tarmac. We are both very competitive, very close on pace, and we find ourselves always fighting each other at the same time that we fight the Mercedes, the Red Bulls, and the McLarens. I don't think we could have finished more than P3 and P4 today, yeah, it's what it is. We will keep pushing and see if we can keep a good momentum up. Yeah, more challenges, more things going on than maybe what we expected. At the same time, I think today Mercedes was just the quicker car, the quicker package. I think George and Lewis drove a very good race. At the same time that us, we just struggled too much with graining, more than what we were anticipating. And yeah, it meant that we couldn't push on the tyres. We were having to save so much that we couldn't use the pace of the car. And yeah, we were just simply not fast enough. So yeah, not our day. We just simply didn't execute in general. We just didn't execute a very good race. I think we stayed out one lap too late on Mediums, two laps too late on Hards. And by the time I was going to pit, we had this messy radio communication in the pit entry, which probably made me lose that lap that I was completely grained and I had to let pass Charles plus the two or three seconds that I lost in the pit entry. That means a lot of race time that maybe would have meant we could have ended up fighting Lewis. But yeah, it just shows that in this sport, you need to do things perfectly week in, week out. We've been doing things really well in strategy and on race management all year around. But today wasn't our day. We just didn't do things well and we will have to learn from it and make sure we come back in Qatar stronger. We just need to go into that trying to maximise whatever we have. I think over the last few weekends we've done a good job. I think today the maximum, yesterday the maximum was a P2 in quali, today the maximum was a P3 in the race. In Qatar, the maximum might be a P5 or a P6 because in that car, with this car in a track like Qatar, I expect to struggle and I expect McLaren and Mercedes to be very strong. probably also even Red Bull, given that they were strong also in quali in Austin. So yeah, I think it's going to be a very challenging weekend for us. That's why today it was important for us to get maximum number of points available, and we kind of did that for the pace that we had. Yeah, congrats. I think he's driven for four years now at an incredibly high level. I think this year he just dominated whenever he had a dominant car and then he didn't do mistakes and maximize the points that he could get with a less so performing car and just did whatever he had to do in every race. And yeah, congrats because he clearly deserves it. Yeah, I think he grained the Medium tyres and I managed to get ahead before the pit stop on Mediums. Then I did grain my Hards and he was coming quick behind me and me anticipating what was going to be a situation, because Lewis was straight behind Charles at the time, and I was pretty sure the team was going to ask me to let Charles by because he was quicker at the time. As I was on grained tyres, I asked the team two or three times to box me, to get me out of the way, and get me a new set of Hards to make sure that I wasn't losing a lot of race time by having to let Charles by and then having to fight Lewis at the same time. For some reason we didn't box and I ended up having to let Charles by a lap later than was planned and losing a lot of race time. And by the time I was going to box, then we didn't even box. So I guess he's not happy, but I'm also not happy with the way things were handled at the time. And yeah, I think no one's happy today in the team because we all expected a bit more. I'm on the podium, so at least I got that for the team. But at the same time, I don't think we could have finished much better than P3 and P4 today. Same, I think, as George said. It is down to the fitness that you've accumulated during the first part of the year and keeping yourself fit and healthy. It will be quite a shock to the body, but if you're fit, you're healthy, and you've managed to keep yourself warm here, don't get any colds, take melatonin whenever you have to take melatonin, and go to sleep whenever you have to go to sleep, it should get it done. But I agree that no one will be in peak form in Qatar. Yeah, I think it's been a step forward compared to last year. I feel like last year, F1, if anything, was trying a bit too hard to put on too much of a show. It got a bit too much away from Formula 1 and too much into Vegas style. And I feel like this year we've just been just more normal doing our own thing. And it's been a success. It just shows the Formula 1 product works and you don't need to try too hard. And yeah, I'd bring the race a couple hours earlier if I could. I think it would help everyone in the paddock, everyone that does the job in this sport, I think, would put everyone in a healthier, better mood through the weekend. So a couple of hours early race and timings and not a back-to-back with Qatar. That's what I would ask everyone as the next step. For the rest, great circuit to put on a good race, great for overtaking, challenging track. I wouldn't change anything, just those two details. And I think everything will be better. Lewis' comments and George’s are spot on. As much as I think Max has done an incredible job this year, it just shows the second half of the season, eight drivers within a tenth of each other. We could all beat him week in, week out. He was extremely good, you know, at dominating with a dominant car and extremely good at not making mistakes the second half of the season. And that's what's given him, for me, driver of the year and the championship. But the second half of the season just shows that when we are all in equal, more of an equal machinery, we can all go up against each other and make each other's life difficult. And everyone starts making mistakes when they're under pressure and everyone starts complaining about their car and everyone starts complaining in the media about their car. And, you know, it's all about pressure management and not having that margin. Whenever you don't have a two, three tenths margin on your nearest rival or your teammate, suddenly a pressure ramps up and everyone is human.",Las Vegas,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Definitely not. I was just happy to be there and dreaming of potential victories or standing on the podium, the normal things that are already very difficult to achieve. Then we just got on to that run after, of course, a tough few years that we kept trying and then we just hit the ground running with a new concept, and like I said, to be standing here as a four-time world champion is just incredible. Yeah, for sure. I mean, you know, it was a very challenging season. I think also as a person, at times it's very challenging and I had to be calm. And I think in a way, of course, I still prefer last season. I enjoyed that a lot. But I think this season, definitely, again, taught me a lot of lessons that I'm very proud of. How we handled it also as a team. So in a way, of course, that makes it also a very, very special and beautiful season. Yeah, of course, to the fans, you know, always it's amazing to see them everywhere supporting me. I think they got a bit spoiled last year with all the wins, so they had to wait for it a long time in the middle of the season, but, yeah, incredible sport always, and great to see them again here as well. And, to the team? Yeah, what can I say? I mean, we have been through a lot together and all these highs that we are achieving right now are just very, very special. To do that with all the group of people that we have here at the track and back at the factory that they're continuously pushing flat out to give me the car to fight for a title and to do that four times in a row is very special. Yeah, I mean, of course, if you look at it to next year right now, I think it's going to be a proper battle between a lot of cars. But yeah, I'm hungry. Of course, I'm going to enjoy this, but there are still two more races that I want to do well at the same time. And then, of course, we take a little break, and then we try and go at it again next year. Thank you very much. Yes, I know. What time is it? I'm very thirsty, so... Thank you, guys. Yeah, it sounds very good. Yeah, something that when you grow up racing and you see all these stats of some legendary drivers and you're like, ‘that's very impressive and I hope one day that I can even just be on the podium, win a race, maybe win a championship’. It's already hard enough to win one. Of course, then you also need a bit of luck to be in the right team situation to maybe win more. But yeah, luckily we did that. But I think that was more like the first three championships. Now this year, we hit the ground running well, but then we had a lot of tough races. And that is something I'm very proud of, in those tough races where we were definitely not the fastest car, we kept it together as a team. We worked very hard back at the factory as well, remained calm, most of the times. And we barely made any mistakes. We really maximised or even overperformed in some places. Plus, our opposition also in a few places definitely didn't grab the points that they should have. And all those things, of course, matter at the end of the day when you fight for a championship. I think so, too. I mean, last year, I had a dominant car, but I always felt that not everyone appreciated what we achieved as a team, winning 10 in a row. Of course, our car was dominant, but it wasn't as dominant, I think, as people thought it was. That's for sure my best season [2023]. I will always look back at, because even in places where maybe we didn't have the perfect set-up, we were still capable, because in the race, our car was always quite strong, to win races. But I'm also very proud of this season because for most of the season, I would say for 70% of the season, we didn't have the fastest car, but actually we still extended our lead. So that is definitely something that I'm very proud of. You always have to believe in yourself, but at the end of the day, it's a lot of people that have to come together and a lot of things that have to come together with the car, especially in the middle of the season where we had a lot of issues where we didn't really understand what was going on. But then I'm also very happy and I'm proud of how the team reacted, responded, and turned it around a bit. At one point, it seemed like we were a little bit lost, but at least now it feels like it's all a bit more normal. Of course, here in Vegas, I feel like it's a very one-off event where it's very cold and the track layout is also quite special. But in general, I do think that since Austin, we have turned it around a little bit and we're a bit more in that fight again. And yeah, all credit to the team for that. Of course, I know that it's been quite a tough season for us overall, also the constructors, but at least we still won one championship. Yeah, I mean, we have a lot of incredible young talent in the sport and Lando is definitely one of them. And of course, at times, he made it very difficult for me. We simply didn't have an answer in many races where they were just clearly faster. So that made it, of course, difficult. But to win a championship, you need to be consistent. Sometimes you try to overperform. It doesn't happen every weekend, but sometimes you can. And that's what we did. But of course, McLaren at the moment, you know, they're extremely strong. And of course, you know, Lando, I know him, of course, for a long time already. So also to race a friend of yours to the title is always a little bit different. But I think we have a lot of respect for each other. And yeah, well, I'm sure that we'll have many more battles to come. Yeah, I mean, the beginning was quite, let's say, a bit messy, but I think I'm quite calm in those situations. I think it's very difficult to disturb me with anything. I'm very focused on the racing side of things. And I know that when I sit in the car, I forget about everything, even positive, negative stuff. And I just focus on what's ahead of me, and that's performance, and drive the car as fast as I can. You need to have that momentum as well. You need to have the right team to be able to achieve that for a long period of time. It's not something that I set out to do. Of course, if it happens, it happens. But I'm already very proud to win four. I mean, at the end of the day, winning one or seven, it's the same thing, right? But, of course, if you can repeat it a few times, that is very nice. And, of course, I know that if we have that opportunity again, I mean, even with not the fastest car, we still won it, so I always know that when I sit in the car, I'm going to give it everything I have. And of course, over the last few years, I also grew as a driver and you definitely become more all around. So in a way, of course, also very excited to see what we can do next year. It's very unknown at the moment, of course, how competitive we are going to be. But for now, I'm just going to enjoy the moment. Well, I ran out of beer. So yeah, I don't know, maybe another one. And then maybe I switch to something else. I don't need to drive anymore. So the slogan, don't drink and drive, works very well. I don't need to do that anymore. Yeah, I mean, every championship has actually been very different in emotions. It will never top the emotions of the first one because that is what you set out to do and that's your ultimate dream and goal to win one. So that was mass civilization, but then you know, the season has been very different to the second one and last year's one. And that's, I think, very beautiful, because if they're all fairly similar, that's not as exciting. And honestly, when I crossed the line, I was just very relieved. I was like, it's over. It's been a tough run of races, and I'm very happy that it rained in Brazil. Well, what I know is that the team doesn't give up. There are a lot of very competent people and I really enjoy working with them. I know it's been tough for them as well. You know, there was a lot of pressure on them this year. And when you come out of a season like last year, where basically we broke every record and then at one point, you know, you start to struggle with the car and you don't really seem to understand what is going on or what is going wrong. It's important to remain calm and try to fix it. Every person in the team has their own emotions that you have to deal with. So in a way, it's also people management because everyone reacts a little bit different to good results or bad results. But that's something that I enjoy as well because everyone has their own character, but we all have to work together to the same end goal. I'm very proud of how everyone stuck together in those very tough races where we came out a bit lost. Then we got back at the factory, there were a lot of analysis going on. Just the response from that, I think when we went to Austin, after really understanding our issues from, let's say, Monza, to see already an upturn in performance and a lot of ideas for next year. A few things we couldn't change anymore this year, so that is something for next year, and I just hope that that makes the car more driveable, in general, of course, more competitive. But I also, of course, know that the other ones are not sitting still, so next year is going to be, I think, a big battle. But like I said before, even when you're not the quickest, if you just keep maximising those results, a lot is possible. To be honest, I think in your life, every year there are always thoughts going through your head from, how long do I still want to do this? Where do I want to do this? How do I want to do this? There are things in your private life that happen, of course, in your racing life. There are always things that you have to deal with and think about. But that's fine. I mean, I think in general quite relaxed about these things because it's very important to split your private life and racing life. But it's fine to have these thoughts in your head about what you want to do. But at the same time, I'm also not someone that makes very drastic decisions at the same time. And I'm just very happy where I'm at at the moment. I'm very loyal to the team. I appreciate, of course, what they have done for me from picking me up out of F3 and giving me an F1 seat and then going through all these emotions over all the years with these key people in the team. So, when there are tough times, it's very easy to say goodbye or forget about it or ignore it. But I think it's actually way more important to actually face them and go through it together and deal with it and just try to just move on from there and focus back, of course, on the performance side of things and have fun out there. That's at the end of the most important. If you're not having fun, then there's no point to continue. I mean, most of the highs, I think, were in the beginning of the season where we were still competitive and winning races. And it seemed like a little bit of a repeat of last year in the beginning. And then the lows, I would say, I mean, tough times are definitely the ones in the middle where we were struggling for pace, not making the podiums even. But we always maximised our results. We just kept it together in a way. I mean, to be honest with you, when I look back at this season, probably in 20 years’ time, when I'm retired, Las Vegas ’24,  as a race, is not going to be in my top 10. But it's still very special to win it here. And just looking back at that season that we had. I would say there were quite a few lows, but in a way, they also taught me a lot about myself, the team, how we kept it together. And that's what I'm also very proud of, how we handled it all and still came out on top. You know, so for me personally, you know, I don't really ever think about the mental side because for me, that's not really. Yeah, I mean, for me, when I sit in the car, I just try to go flat out, do everything I can. And when I come home, I want to focus on other stuff. But at times, of course, it's quite frustrating when you've had such a run of results last year. You come into this year and it's, again, going quite well. Of course, I always thought to myself already after last year, like don't expect another year like that. It's very rare that those things happen. But then at one point, you know, the car was also just really difficult to drive. And then it was about just working together with the team, because when you have these tough moments, it can also be very demotivating. You know, like whatever, you know, I give up on this. But then those moments are actually very important to keep it together and actually work harder and try to understand what is going on. Because even those moments you give up, you are going to give up the championship as well. Well, I would say from Miami onwards, most of the time we were not the quickest anymore. And Miami is still very early on in the season. So, you know, 50 points, 60 points, they can very easily be overturned if you keep maximising results and not do anything crazy. So, I mean, I've experienced that myself, being 30, 40 points down. I think in ‘22. Anything is possible, so I had that always in the back of my mind, but at the same time, it's just focus on what I could control within the team and just give it everything every single weekend.",Las Vegas,post-race,Red Bull
George Russell,"Honestly, absolutely not. It feels incredible to be back on pole. We've been so quick all weekend, and I just knew coming into that last Q3 lap, that's going to be the one that counts. It doesn't matter what's happened before then. And I had a bit of a moment on my first run, and we had to change the front wing. So there was a moment I thought we weren't going to make the flag. But just so happy and, you know, we've got to do some deep diving to understand why it's been so quick so far this weekend because it was a real surprise. Yeah, I mean, ultimately, you've got to put it on the table sometimes, and I felt confident in myself. I knew if I did a clean lap it would be enough to secure a front row. So to get pole position, it's incredible, but ultimately, you know, we've had a few good qualifyings recently. We need to convert that into a win now. Yeah, it's great always being in Las Vegas. It's late night, good atmosphere here, and excited for the race now. Yeah, incredibly satisfying, and especially knowing the car's been so quick all weekend. You know, as a team, we've topped every single session. And nevertheless, when you get to Q3, you know what's happened beforehand has no influence whatsoever. So the pressure kind of is ramped up. And, you know, it was a little bit touch and go for a moment because we had to change the front wing. I wasn't sure if I was going to get the last lap. But then it was a super strong lap, especially the first two sectors, and just really, really pleased to secure the pole. Massively. I think probably between the very first car and the very last car who does their lap, it's probably over a tenth. It's probably the biggest track ramp of the whole season. So I wanted to put it all on the line. And, you know, it's high risk. I knew that if there were no yellow flags, then we would, you know, we had the possibility to be on the front row. But ultimately, as well, I want to say thanks to the guys in the garage to get the front wing change so quick as well, because, as I said, I touched the wall in the first run and we could have missed that last run altogether. I'd love to tell you, to be honest, it's been a real surprise for all of us. And it's something we need to really review because this is an outlier circuit. We haven't done anything out of the ordinary specifically for Vegas, but for whatever reason, the conditions, the layout, is playing in our favour. And I'm kind of scratching my head as to why. You know, we will ride with it for the time being. But as I said, if you're quick in Vegas, it's a bit of a one-off circuit. So we need to understand it. And of course, one of our other poles was in Canada as well, which is very cold, street circuit-esque conditions too, so there's a small trend. No, to be honest. No, I think there's been no secret. We've been struggling with a bit of understeer this season and the track in Vegas, you're sliding around quite a lot, and maybe that's been a small factor that the understeer limitation has been less noticeable here. But there are certain corners where this car is performing so well, and especially in the first sector, the car feels absolutely on rails, especially through the third corner. And as I said, we need to nail down after the weekend and maybe even into the winter why it's been working so good. Well, I think the long run for everybody has been very challenging on the Medium and the Soft. There's a lot of graining. We saw the same last year, but I expect the Hard tyre to be very resilient. But not one single driver has run the Hard tyre as yet this whole weekend. So you're going to be learning on the fly. It's going to be probably surviving that first stint and going from there. But, you know, here in Vegas, anything can happen. It's a long race. There was a timely Safety Car for a number of people last year, and we also saw that last race in Brazil. So, you know, right now I'm very happy, very satisfied, but I'm not taking anything for granted going into tomorrow. I think tomorrow we should have the pace to fight for the win. At the same time, there's too many unknowns to confirm or deny that. A lot of it will be graining, graining limitation, who can control the graining better. But even if we might see some teams struggling a lot on Medium tyres, then the Hard resets everything again because no one's run the Hard. And we know that we are not the best team on Hard tyres this season. So yeah. Too many unknowns to tell, but I'm confident that we can fight for a win. Yeah, I'd say the trend that we've seen this season of being quicker, or let's say at the upper end of a timesheet, has probably been down more to the fact that our rivals use a bit more fuel, probably not using their high power. Whenever our strategists have done the review, we normally end up qualifying where they predicted we'd be after practice. It's just when you see the timesheets, it's maybe a little bit more flattering. But this weekend, it was slightly different again because the track was so different in FP1 and FP2. The lap times were probably four or five seconds quicker come qualifying. And it's a very challenging decision on a Thursday night when the car is working well. You don't want to touch it, but you know it's going to be totally different tomorrow. And you need to make some changes to follow the track improvement. So yeah, as I said, still was still scratching our heads a little bit as to why, but it's been a great weekend so far. I'd say positive, to be honest. I think we've been through a little bit of an era where our comments are taken on board, but very little change happens. For example, a number of drivers spoke about the track limits of the exit of Turn 4. We felt it was a little bit unnecessary on a street circuit. He made a change to it in the moment, and I think that's what we want to see as drivers we want to be we heard we want to be heard and we want to see action taken straight away. So I mean, so far it's been positive. I think it will only help the tyre graining, which we're only expecting to see on probably the Medium tyre, but from probably lap 15, 20 onwards, it's not going to make a big impact. Yeah, similar to Carlos, it's a real challenge for the body. Such a big shift from Europe. And of course, we have to shift back when we go to Qatar next week. So it's difficult to get your eight hours sleep in when it's so offset. So for me, it's also just trying to sleep when you can, so I took. you know, a nap before qualifying. Woke up a little bit drowsy and then made sure I was in peak condition come the end of qualifying. But it's really difficult, but we're all in the same boat. Yeah, I went to sleep because the body's just all over the place. And I'm just trying to sleep when I can and just listen to my body. And if I need to sleep, sleep. And there wasn't much to do. The car was feeling good. I was feeling good. So we didn't change the setup at all going into qualifying. So it was sleep was the best thing. I mean, to be honest, I'd normally try and probably sort of meditate as opposed to sleep, just sort of close my eyes and listen to, I don't know, waves crashing against the sea or breathing exercises. I sort of do like box breathing and works for me. It sort of relaxes my mind and takes a bit of pressure off. But yeah, today got probably 45 minutes. So yeah, as I said, it's just adapting every single weekend. When people ask me, like, what's your race weekend routine, the routine changes every single weekend, depending on how you slept the night before, the circumstances you find yourself in. And obviously here, it's so challenging for everyone being so offset, working night shift effectively. You know, for me, just sleeping when I can is working for me.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, very tricky. Well, thanks for the cheers. That was a tough, tight quali. A bit closer to pole than what I was expecting, actually. I thought I had pole and then George came very, very quick there at the end. But, yeah, very happy. I think we're starting in a good position for tomorrow. P2 last year, but it was P12 on the grid because of the famous drain cover. This year I start P2, so hopefully we can make a better one. Yeah, that's why we need to stay confident that tomorrow we could be fighting at the front even more than today. So if today we were close in quali, tomorrow we might have a chance at going for the win. And that will be the target. Obviously, passing and strategy will be a different thing tomorrow. I feel like today, Mercedes were very good at switching those tyres on. If you see, in Sector 1, they were flying. They were three tenths up on us. And then we were coming back as the lap was going on. But tomorrow it's a clean sheet, new start, and see how the cars behave in high field. I honestly think we need wins also to beat McLaren. It's not like we can afford to just be in front of them because they have a big gap in the championship. And then we're going to Qatar. that it's not going to be a good track for us and we're going to be struggling there. So, yeah, I think we need to win. So it's not like it changes much my approach. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, it must have been a good lap. My previous best lap time was a 32.7. So I went down three tenths on that lap and it felt good. I was pushing the limits. At one point I thought I had pole position because I thought I was one of the last ones to cross the line. But then suddenly they told me George was coming and I knew that the Mercedes had been quick all weekend. They've been a bit of a step ahead of us, especially on a single lap. And I knew at that point that, yeah, George could take it. They've been particularly quick in Sector 1. We're taking three or four tenths on them every single lap. And even if my lap from Sector 2 and 3 onwards is very good, it just looks like Sector 1, they've been a bit too strong for us. But tomorrow, everything changes. Everyone will be running on grained tyres, on high fuel, and very different conditions. situation as today, and it will be everything open again. Yeah, I think. when you see our gap to McLaren and Red Bull, we out-qualified them and we were stronger than the two teams that we've been fighting recently. But suddenly there's been a new invite to the party and it's been clearly George and Lewis all weekend topping the timesheet. So, yeah, I think going into quali, I knew they were probably going to be ahead. So, yeah, to be only a tenth off George and just next to him for the race is, I think, pretty much the maximum we could do today. I think the race is not won or lost in Turn 1. At the same time, I feel like this year there's more grip in Turn 1 than there was last year. So, yeah, let's see. The thing with Vegas is we might wake up tomorrow and the track might be completely dirty again like it was in FP3 and we're only doing laps to the grid, but we are not passing through Turn 1. No one's going to know what amount of grip is in Turn 1. Hopefully I get a good start and obviously I can get George into Turn 1. But obviously at the same time, there's so little grip and so many unknowns and so much possibility of overtaking around Vegas that it's also down to a very long race. So let's see. No, I think we are genuinely fighting for the win with Mercedes tomorrow. They went through a run of winning, I think, three consecutive races in mid-season and whenever they get it together, they are very, very fast and the fastest, like they've shown today. So I think we're definitely going to fight George. I think Pierre, if he keeps these lap times, why not? And of course, Charles behind in P4 and who is P5? Max. Maybe with his higher downforce car can take a better care of the tyres and the graining and then suddenly he can get in the mix also. So I think we're fighting many cars and I think that is the beauty of Formula 1 nowadays, it’s that we went into this qualifying with four teams being capable of taking pole position, four teams capable of winning tomorrow if you put everything together and that's a great thing for everyone, I think. Yeah he's been given a massive task to come into a season with three race left and Race Director, I think it’s such a complicated role in Formula 1, which you have so many variables to control that I think he's been given a very difficult task, but honestly, the first weekend straight from the go, I think he's been really good. I think the Driver's Briefing yesterday was one of the best we've had in a long time. George commented on the Turn 3 exit. I will say we also asked for some changes on the pit entry to make the line more visible because we literally couldn't see the pit entry line, so we were very worried about that and today we turn up to the track and the pit entry line was widened, was put a blue line and we were all saying this was really nice because they did a very nice change and with a very good approach. and the way we were listening yesterday was honestly also a very positive meeting and I'm encouraged by that. Yeah, I'm a bit worried about Qatar because if you see Turn 1 and Turn 3, it's exactly the type of corner you have in Qatar. Fourth, fifth gear, long combined, which is exactly where we've been struggling. And just in that sector today to the Merc, we were three tenths off. So if you keep adding those corners up, it could be a tough one for us in Qatar. So tomorrow is a good opportunity to get points because we might lose them in Qatar. So, yeah, I think we're going to go into the race trying to win because that's what we need to target. Also knowing McLaren is behind and with the two cars trying to get the maximum points possible because we know in order to beat McLaren, we're probably going to go through a weekend in Qatar where we're also losing points. So we need to make sure we gain them and knowing that, yeah, there are 30 something points ahead. That is quite a lot. I think we are both the first one interested in winning the Constructors’. I'm not going to lie. I think we're both very motivated to do so, and we are collaborating with each other more than ever before, also because I'm very far off him in the championship with the two or three zeros that I had this season. And even though I'm driving well, I think there is not personal battles for the Driver's Championship going on. And this means that we have a common interest of clinching the Constructors’ because we both have that left for us in the in the championship, and we are collaborating more than ever before, as I said, and cooperating as much as we can. And yeah, we will go into tomorrow knowing that that is the number one priority. Yeah, I've seen also it's going to be a lot windier. So, you know how much these cars get affected by the wind. So you have warmer but also windier. I heard also that big winds are going to be a headwind down the back straight. So that could make DRS and slipstreaming more important tomorrow. So yeah, throwing even more variables into the equation with the wind, with the dust maybe coming to the track. So I think it could be a different day or interesting day. Yeah, I hope Williams comes as a favourite. But no, I think Ferrari, McLaren, favourites for next year. Max, you always need to count him as a favourite. And then if Merc discover why they won three races in a row and why they're on pole here, they're going to be favorites also. I think it just shows that it could go anywhere. When you have four teams within two tenths and they have a whole winter to work on the car and improve the car, those two tenths could quickly switch around and create a different favourite. So all four teams for me could be in the fight. I will go to sleep at 4 a.m., wake up at 12. I think today I woke up at 12. So as late as possible, basically, because if not, the day becomes so long that you arrive to the night very tired. And yeah, I've been changing my sleeping routine one hour more or less every day that I spend here. I managed to go to sleep an hour later, wake up an hour later. And tomorrow I'll try and wake up at 1. Apart from that, you do breakfast, lunch, and dinner according to that timetable. So my breakfast is at 2 p.m., lunch is at 7, dinner is in an hour or two. So, yeah, it's weird, but for me, it's just how the day works here. And I want to keep everything as a normal weekend, getting the same amount of hours of sleep, and then keeping myself the same time until the important session of the week.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, it's the first time ever, so no, it's unbelievable. Honestly, we didn't think we'd be able to achieve a top three in the quali, so it was an incredible lap, especially around this track, you know, you're flirting with the walls everywhere through the lap, and a lot of adrenaline, a lot of excitement. I knew crossing the line it was a good lap, but when they came up on the radio telling me we're lining up third tomorrow, it's just amazing, so really happy. Yeah, I mean, I was getting cold in the car. You know, we had to wait so long before that Q3. I just wanted to get going, and yeah, we had a good first run. That last lap was the one that mattered, you know, with a new tyre. And, yeah, I really managed to nail it. So the car felt great. I must say it's an incredible period for the team following the double podium in Brazil. So hopefully we can, you know, stay up there tomorrow. Yeah, it's absolutely incredible, you know, as a team. Exactly as you mentioned, we started Bahrain on the last row with both cars, and all of a sudden, the last few weeks have been quite a change. I'm really happy and pleased with the work the team has been doing in a season where everything looked impossible, just to still stick together and put some more performance in that car. Going into qualifying today, I must admit we never thought we'll be in a position to actually you know get in that top three, but yeah, I managed to have a very special lap at the right time on that last set in Q3 and uh yeah it's a it's a very nice surprise. I mean, we went with a pretty aggressive package in terms of downforce, so we are running very little downforce around this track. We try to maximise the straight lines, we obviously make our lives slightly harder in the corners. But yeah, I think it's a challenging track. It's very cold conditions. It's quite an outlier in the season. But I had a nice feeling in the car since P1. P2 went well. P3 went well. And then in that Q3, we managed to make it work with only one set of new tyres as well. So there was definitely some good pace. And yeah, for now, I'm very pleased. Obviously, it's only qualifying, but I think it's probably the first time I qualify in the top three. And it feels like it was a special one. Well, at the minute, that's not really what I'm thinking about. I think we know where the target is for us. We're fighting Haas and AlphaTauri (sic) in the Constructors’. Obviously, whatever happened in that quali is amazing. It feels good to be in front of Max and McLaren and these guys. But at the end of the day, it's not our fight. So we'll give our best shot tomorrow. Exactly as Carlos said, it's a challenging one around here with the graining. So we'll make sure we do our homework tonight to maximize the chances tomorrow. But for sure, from P3, we increase our chances to get some good points. Yeah, I think they summed it up. It's been a great start and great to see good communication. So far, very positive. Yeah, same. I think it's going to make it… We know it's challenging. We've seen last year and I think tomorrow conditions are going to be even, let's say, more challenging. So, yeah, it brings opportunities and that's the way I see it. I think it's great to see Alpine in the top three. That's what I can tell. But I mean, if you're looking at the championship, I think it's been tighter than ever this year. Obviously, we’d love to be in the battle more often, but as a motorsport fan as well, I must say it's enjoyable when you have this unpredictability in terms of results. You get three, four teams fighting for race wins. Hopefully, we can keep that going into next year, which I think we won't see massive surprises in terms of performance, but hopefully the grid can get even closer and we can get a bit more different faces for you guys to see for the top three after Quali and the races more often. Don't put your alarm tomorrow before the race! Yeah, exactly. Similar comments, maybe shifted a bit later for me compared to Carlos, but I find what’s most challenging here is the amount of sunlight you get throughout the whole week is just so little that it just makes it kind of strange reason because you're in the night for a full week pretty much. Yeah, it's a bit strange, but, yeah, we get used to it. We know it's tough. It's one of these things where it's almost better not really to think about it because there's nothing we can do. So, you know, it's business. Just get it done. And then next week's going to be tough. We're all going to, you know, struggle, but it's going to be the same for everyone. So, yeah, just get through it.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,Alpine
Esteban Ocon,"Thank you. Yeah, it's been a fun race, definitely. An unexpected one, that's for sure. Looking at our dry pace, that's not where we were at all. But when the rain came, it definitely opened up opportunities. Yeah, I mean, I felt good in those conditions. It reminded me a little bit of 2016, you know, at the time where I was fighting for a point with the Manor. And yeah, we were leading the race for a while, which felt good, definitely. And yeah, I think it's been a very nice one because it spiced things up for our end of season. Now that we can be, you know, fighting near the other teams. teams, you know, in the Constructors’ Championship. So it's going to be a big fight, which is a lot more entertaining for us. And yeah, it brings up, you know, fun and joy for all the people around the factory. Well, I think we need to keep the foot to the ground. That's going to be very important. I don't think we are going to be able to fight for podiums and almost wins like in Brazil. But last year here, we finished fourth, which was also a very strong race. But yeah, this year would be much more difficult with the car pace we have in the dry. So, yeah, we need to do the best we can, take all the opportunities that there is, and hopefully it will be a positive one for us. I can only talk for myself here. I'm not very confident, to be fair, at the moment. Looking at you know our dry pace, we've improved recently, getting some updates to the car. It's been getting better, but as I said it can flip completely from one side to another, having a decent result and these races are usually when the opportunities arrive. So we need to be on top of that if something happens to be able to score some points and close the season that way. To be fair, as a fan of the sport, honestly, it’s a pain to be watching every day a new livery, and sometimes you are missing it because you are doing something else and you see it in different times. I think at least we have one day where we see all the cars, which as a fan of the sport, I'm excited for that. Of course, it's one more event for us, which is not ideal in that period because it's going to be very busy. We need to prepare. We need to be fully trained before we get into the season, etc. But I think it's much better organised than how it was before, especially when, you know, two teams were having the launch at the same day and it wasn't properly organised. So, yeah, I'm actually looking forward to it. Yeah, super impressed about Abbi's season. You know, especially how she's improved over the time she's been driving in single-seaters. She's really been working super well. You know, she's one of those drivers that trains super hard, stays with the team. She's really involved into listening to us in Formula 1. We get feedback as well from their driving, when they drive before us at times. And it's always very valid, the information we get. And, yeah, I mean, she's been super impressive in what she's done. And I hope that she can, you know, wrap up the title this year. Yeah, it's a weekend that I've discovered, obviously, last year, like all of us, but I didn't really know what to expect. But as a racing track, being able to race, overtake, I think it provides really interesting challenges and you have to race on it. I think it's really fun. The atmosphere is a different part. We had some build up last year. to it. But yeah, I do enjoy the venue and I do enjoy racing around the street. Yeah, I mean, as George said before, I think it's definitely not an easy race to start in, around here, you know, as a street circuit. But I think Rui, he came from Macau just now, so it's probably a tougher circuit than here, definitely. And yeah, looking forward to meet him and have good chats at the drivers meeting with him and seeing how he works. I'm sure we are going to be talking a lot on how he does things, what ideas he has on, very important topics to us like track limits, kerbs, etc. Everybody has his way of doing things. And yeah, we need to obviously communicate well in terms of what we feel is very important going forward.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"Well, you can't be confident at all. You know, we were not even thinking about Alpine, really, in that battle, and then suddenly they're ahead of us. So I think we feel like we're in a good place with the car. And recently we've kind of consistently been in the run for points. Now that Aston Martin are struggling, there's actually some points available at each race. So, it's exciting. I mean, we're now three teams for that P6, which, for the teams mean a lot. You know, whether you finish eighth or sixth, it's a big thing. And yeah, for a driver, of course, it's not like something you put on your CV, but it just means so much for everyone that it's worth fighting for. I just think the upgrades that we've had this year have been good in all areas. It's just made the car slightly faster over one lap, a little bit easier to drive, and better on the tyres. It's just kind of given the car a bit of a broader window every time we put something on. So that's been a really good job from the team. It's been kind of the headline for this year, I think. If you look at what we've improved the most it’s how we've been able to develop the car through the season, whereas most other years or basically all other years, we've not been able to do that. We've, I think, had a good car to begin with because when the whole team is kind of available over the winter. They've been doing a good job, but over the season, not so much. So that's really a big step forward to see the improvements we've been able to make. I think it's… Obviously you put more downforce, you go quicker, but also I think when you make the car more predictable, that gives a lot of lap time too, and especially on the tyres, it helps a lot when, you know, you're not, it's not as easy to overdrive the car when the window and, you know, the balance is more consistent. So that's just been a help and something that’s been nice to see. You make it sound like that's not a lot! It's a lot. I mean, yeah, it's been strange to... I've watched Formula 1 on television too much recently, and yeah, it's going to be nice to be back, hopefully, in the race. No, I don't think so. I mean, for myself, I've been in this situation twice before, so it's kind of the third time that I feel like this is going to be the last race. So I just know that you never know. So, it's kind of fine in a way. I don't really think about it. Next year I'm not going to be in Formula 1, that's pretty clear, but I've learned over the years and with my experiences from one that every race you do, you just have to enjoy it. And, you know, yeah, well, as long as it lasts, enjoy it. So that's my plan. I don't know. I can't remember saying exactly that, but I think we have been clear that we want to work together in some capacity and I think that's... We are talking about how we could do that, of course. A little bit it's come from Ayao and I'm open to hear what he is thinking and see if I can be helpful in any way. Well, it's Wednesday, so you know, usually the kind of atmosphere builds up over the weekend. But, yeah, it's been obviously just a normal Thursday, but on a Wednesday. I think it's… I don't know if it's a big concern as such. I think it’s a tough job and you know it's something… It's a job that requires experience and to be honest I don't know how experienced the new guy is. I know he's come from F2 and F3, so he must have some experience. Hopefully he's going to be fine. I think we all, certainly I do, tend to compare to the Charlie Whiting days that certainly for us drivers, he was someone that we felt really connected to and always felt like we were being listened to, whereas now it sort of seems like it's a lot of us against them almost and it should definitely be more of a cooperation and a closer connection between us and them because we can help each other a lot. So hopefully the new guy will sort of help go in that direction.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Haas
George Russell,"Yeah, it definitely felt like a missed opportunity. I think having reviewed the race, you recognise how quickly things can change. We made the pit stop, which with the perfect benefit of hindsight, that was incorrect. But had that Virtual Safety Car stayed for 10 seconds longer or 15 seconds longer, it would have been absolutely the right thing to do. So it just shows how quickly an external decision can change your race and how you need to be very quick to adapt to that. And we kind of were a little bit too focused on that pit stop and not actually seeing that a car that was beached on the road was being pushed off and the VSC was ending. Brazil was definitely a bit of a one-off, I think. When it rains, it presents opportunities. And for ourself, it was an opportunity. For everyone at Alpine, it was a huge opportunity, which they capitalised. And I think we need to look back to the Sprint qualifying and the Sprint race for a bit of a fairer picture of where we are. And that was behind the front four teams. I think now we've done almost a full season, we totally understand why the car is so up and down. It has just such a narrow window and when we can set the car up in a way that we exploit that window, we have a race-winning car. But when you go to different circuits and you have to change where you position the set-up, we totally fall outside of our working window. So It's obviously frustrating when you know the car has that potential. But I think for everyone, you have these fluctuations in performance. We've done a good job to capitalise on races that we did, had the pole positions when the car was capable of pole positions. And ultimately, we just need to make a more consistent car over the course of 24 races. Yeah, we definitely weren't aware. It was a bit of a surprise, I think, for everybody. And, you know, it's a hell of a lot of pressure now onto the new race director. Just three races left. So I think for us... Often as drivers, we probably feel like we're the last to find out this sort of information. And when it involves us kind of directly, it would be nice to be kept in the loop and just have an understanding of what decisions are being made. So, yeah, time will tell. I'm sure the new guy will handle the position just fine, but definitely not an easy race for a new race director. I mean, talking as a fellow driver as opposed to sort of my role with the GPDA, I think everybody felt with certain things that have happened over the course of this year that we wanted to sort of stand united. At the end of the day, we just want to be transparent with the FIA and have this dialogue that is happening, and I think the departure of Niels is also a prime example of not being a part of these conversations. And ultimately, we only we want to work with the FIA to make the best for the sport that we all love. So, I think it's kind of us now putting the pressure back on them to work with us and work with everyone, including F1 as well, just to maximise this opportunity, which Formula 1 is in at the moment, which is, you know, an amazing time to be a part of. Yeah, I agree with Esteban, to be fair. Yeah, well, I think times are changing and the fans are a huge part of this sport. And I think if we're talking about openness and transparency and including everybody in this for the greater good, then having it on a social media platform makes perfect sense. I mean, I can only talk on behalf of myself here as opposed to any of the other drivers, but I think there's no secret that some were not happy with what was going on in terms of the decisions that were being made, but at the end of the day, I think if you worked together with us, that we could have helped improve the matter. And I think sometimes just hiring and firing is not the solution. You kind of need to work together to improve the problem. So, let's see what this new era is going to bring, but every time there is a change, you have to take one step back before you make the two steps forwards. No, no idea whatsoever. So, yeah, as I said, it was a bit of a bit of surprise. No. Not at the moment, which I'm a little bit surprised about, to be fair. But maybe there'll be something to come. Who knows? No, I think ultimately for us, when we were hearing from the FIA a couple of years ago, when it came to the Presidential elections, they were talking about transparency, talking about where the money is going to be reinvested into grassroots racing, which we're all in favour for. And of course, when it comes to some of these large fines, there's a number of drivers on the grid who can comfortably afford these fines. There's maybe some rookies on the grid that if they're handed a $1 million fine, you know, they can't afford this. But if we know where that's being sort of reinvested and if it's going into grassroots or into some training programs, then we get it. As I said, I think we just want the transparency and understanding of what was promised from the beginning. I think we've probably learned from the past that whenever we have spoken up, let's say internally, it hasn't gone anywhere. And as I said, as drivers, we only want the best for the sport. We want to improve it, especially on safety grounds, but whenever it comes to, you know, decisions in the race, we only want to help. And it's been a couple of years now that not much has changed when we have sort of given some views forward. And I guess we all wanted to show that we are collectively united. And maybe that will show how seriously we feel as a whole on the subject. I mean, I'm not too sure to be honest. We recognise everybody's working as hard as they can to do the best job possible. There is obviously a huge amount of change within the FIA quite regularly, so it's clearly not the most stable of places. And maybe that's why it's been a bit challenging to get some of the changes that we've wanted implemented. Of course, everyone has their own side to their own story. But as I said, I think if we feel that we're being listened to and some of the changes that we are experiencing, requesting, are implemented, because ultimately we're only doing it for the benefit of the sport, then maybe our confidence will increase. But yeah, I think there's a number of drivers who feel probably a bit fed up with the whole situation. And it only seems to be going in, to a degree, the wrong direction. Yeah, I mean, it definitely feels strange, this Grand Prix, just living in the night. And like Kevin says, the atmosphere builds up during the course of the weekend. So, yeah, let's see how it goes. Yeah, I mean, ultimately, for most F1 teams, you have near on 1,000 people who are working towards building these two cars, yet you only have two drivers driving it. So, I think, let's say, in Lewis, in my case, it was never that Lewis had a stronger voice. The team listened to us both equally because both of our opinions were extremely important. And the same going into next year. You know, Kimi's new. He's fresh. And I'm sure he's going to have a lot of great ideas to bring to the table. So, you know, I am the more experienced of the two, but we will both get equal voices the same way, and we will both equally contribute towards the development the same way as it was with Lewis and I. It's definitely not difficult to get a sit down, but I think getting things to change or getting promises upheld seems slightly more challenging. So, it's maybe the FIA or the president didn't recognise how seriously we all felt. So I think that's why over the course of 20 races this year and also even last year we spoke about a number of topics, all of the drivers, we all feel pretty similar. We all know what we want from the sport and the direction it's been heading and we probably feel that we want to do a small U-turn on a number of topics and just want to work together with the FIA on this. And that's just what we've felt has not been happening at all, at least directly from the President.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Mercedes
Valtteri Bottas,"I think, you know, the closer we're getting to that date, I did definitely figure out that there was other drivers as candidates as well. And of course, you start to hear rumours. So then in the end, I still thought it's maybe 50-50 chance. And yeah, I got the call on Monday. But yeah, at least I know now. I just need to figure out what's next. Yeah, absolutely. You know, life goes on. There's lots of exciting things ahead. And yeah, I'm fine with it. It's a tricky sport. You know, I think I got into a bit unlucky situation, in terms of hanging on to the last seat on the grid. And when that doesn't happen, then obviously you're out for now. I was talking to lots of people earlier because obviously by the end of your contract year you want to figure out but nothing went further and I still always showed my interest for the Audi project. but it just wasn't meant to be and like I said, a bit unlucky. What is next? That's the big question in life. But yeah, of course it is real. I wouldn't take fake tattoos. The way my active F1 driving career ended for now, it wasn't the best way that you can't really decide yourself. I feel like still I have lots to give for the sport and I still love it. I love the racing against the best drivers in the world, in the best cars in the world. That's what I love. So I'm just trying to figure out now what is the next move. So yeah, I don't really have that much more. I'm taking it day by day. There's some interesting stuff on the table and then we'll see. For me, at the moment, I feel like jumping into a new category comes quite quick. You know, we're almost in December. So yeah, I think that would be more realistic that if I didn't find a seat in F1 during ‘25 or for ‘26, then probably would be from ‘26. But it's all these things that I need to kind of try and plan. But the picture is starting to form in my head what is the ideal situation. Do my best, as always. I always give it my all. We still haven't scored as a team this year, so of course scoring would be good. I think here we, probably Vegas on paper, we have the best chance in the remaining three races. But yeah, I'll do my thing, give it all I have. That's all. Yeah, I've raced all my life, you know, since I was six, five, six years old and I still love it. So I'll be always driving something. I just sometimes like to challenge myself. I just decided on the evening before that tomorrow I want to be an Ironman. And I just did it in a small pool and indoor bike and treadmill. I'd actually never done a marathon before, so now that's done as well. So, yeah, things sometimes just happen. Not so much, much more to add, actually. It's a difficult job and for sure for the new person it will be a challenge. And especially with both titles still in play and everything. So I just hope things go smoothly. But yeah, we really don't, as drivers, we don't really have much background information why this happened, what was the decision to do this. So I guess we will get more details in the drivers’ meeting. It's a good question. I did regret it at times. I think it's just sometimes I just decide to do something and kind of prove to myself that I can do it and really challenge myself. And also the friend who I was hanging with that week, he had done an Ironman... No, I've not heard of anyone actually who's done it by himself in a small room. And just to give some details, there was like no preparation. I only had water and Coca-Cola, a bit of rice… Eleven hours. Just under 11 hours, yeah. And the pacing… Pacing is easy because you can control yourself, but obviously I've never done that long of a distance or I kind of did it as a zone two, let's say, Ironman, so managed to keep the heart rate pretty consistent and it was tough, especially the run in the end, lots of pain management, but I'm glad I did it. It's pretty cool experience and Just you realise how much is just mental. If you don't give up in your head, then you can do almost anything. I was a little bit stiff the next day. I did manage to get up and play some pickleball the next morning. But I would say in a week or so, I felt strong again. So, yeah.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Sauber
Lando Norris,"Reasonably, I think. I mean, last year, a lot has changed since last year. So, yeah, not my finest race, that's for sure. But Oscar had a good pace. The car was actually pretty reasonable in the race. Same as what we've been seeing: a good fight between Red Bull, Ferrari, ourselves, Mercedes. That's all I expect. It's a tough one. Not a lot has changed, honestly. I kind of know the position I'm in now, and probably I have less to lose now. You know, the gap to Max is for the first time, probably when I've looked at the gap myself, and had the realisation of where things stand and I think post-Brazil was a tough one for me because it was the first moment realistically when I'm like it's tough to achieve first position now. We were on such a good run of form, little by little, you know, it's hard to get any big points on Max, because he didn't have any bad races, but I had a tough week, because things just didn't go our way, and my kind of real fight for the championship was slimmed by the biggest margin of almost of the whole year, you know, so a tricky one. But it doesn't change my approach. My approach has been correct. My approach has been the right approach for the last few weekends. I've been performing well. I've been doing a good job. So from my side, I need to not change anything, but I think I can probably just go out and enjoy a little bit more. It's close. I mean, Ferrari have been strong for a long time. They have two very good drivers. They're a very good team. They've clearly improved their car a good amount and found a better direction to head down. And they've become, probably with us, and some races a bit better, some races a little bit behind, some races the same, as a competitor. I think maybe a little bit with them, but we're close. Red Bull are close at the same time. So it's more who can just do a better performance on the weekend. But we do know that Vegas is probably a track that will suit the Ferraris a bit more. It suited them well last year. But Qatar, we know maybe will be more favourable to us again. Yeah, I mean, I always wear coats normally, so... Yeah, they didn't pack our normal coat. Yeah, shocking. That I have what it takes. I think it's the first time in the last six years of Formula 1 when we've had a chance to fight at the front, we've not been able to do that for the last six years. So this is our and my first opportunity to do so, and my first opportunity to see where I stand. And I definitely was not at the level I needed to be at the beginning of the year, and even Miami point of the season. Since the summer break, I feel like I've done a very good job and performed very, very well, by far some of my best performances that I've done. So I've been very happy, actually, with how the last few months have gone, honestly. I wouldn't change many things that have happened. But I still need to make tweaks. I still need to improve on things. That's clear. You know, I'm not completely satisfied with how I've done. I definitely know I need to make improvements. But for the first time, I'm confident to say that I have what I think I need to fight for a championship. Doesn't mean I'm complete, doesn't mean I'm perfect, that's for sure. And when you're competing against drivers who are close to that, like Max, you have to be close to perfect if you want to challenge him, you know, and challenge the teams we're around. So I'm confident and I think the main thing I can take away is I have faith that I have got what it takes to fight for a championship. Under attack as in from who? There are more eyes on you, of course. When you're fighting at the front there's more people watching and you're going to have more supporters. In some ways you're going to have more people who are against you and supporting other drivers. There's definitely been more controversial moments and things. I've definitely voiced my opinion probably more clearly than I have in the past and sometimes people who agree with it sometimes they won't and I'm fine with that. I think things still clearly get taken out of context. That was one of the things in Brazil was stuff got quite easily taken out of context from what I said and created definitely the wrong perception of what I meant and what I said. I don't feel like I'm under attack. You know, I don't mind these things. That's social media. You know, I do my best to just be honest, be myself and you always want people to be on your side. But at the same time, I realise you can't have everyone on your side. And that's probably one of the things I've realised this year. So, yeah, I probably have more enemies, but I've also got more supporters. And I'm obviously happier and more thankful for the supporters that I’ve got. You have to learn to accept it. I think what made it Brazil tough was two things. One was for something like this to happen so late in the season. I think, you know, when it's earlier in the season, you know, it's like it's more so be it and you just see what happens later on. But this was almost a defining moment for the championship. It was a defining moment for the championship. The doors are almost shut. For a week I was pretty down after Brazil because I had that realisation that things are pretty much out of my control now, not within reach necessarily. That's a tough realisation when your hopes and your belief is so high for it to get knocked down so much all of a sudden was pretty demoralising and not the best of feelings. You learn to accept that. that's life. I admitted, and I admitted even in Miami, that I was lucky in Miami to get the win with the Safety Car, and that's the strategy you play. I think Brazil was still a bit more luck of the trade, but that is Formula 1. That's racing. I've not complained about it. Luck can be on your side. It can be on other people's side. That's life. So I don't mind. One day it will go your way. The next it won't. I mean, if I get told to be there, I guess I'll be there, you know? I might see where Max is going on holiday and join him. We might end up having the same illness or something. But I don't know, I think it will still be, it's a cool event. I'm happy for F1, you know. I think it sold out extremely quickly. It's cool for a lot of fans. It's a big thing for Formula 1. So I don't know, I don't know how it's going to be done. I don't know the layout of events, but I'd rather be at home and relaxing and preparing for the season, that's my side, you know. I don't like these types of things. I'm not a public person. I like to relax and do my things, but it's also our job. So in the end of the day, we can't complain. Yeah, it's a tough one. I don't know chess that well, honestly, but it's probably check. I can survive. I can put up a fight. That's what I do, but at some point you kind of know it's not going to be your way and it's not going to go your way. But you never know, so I'm not saying it is over and I won't say it's over until it is, but you know it's very far out of reach at the minute and we've been performing well, but I need a lot of luck if anything, if I can and It's pretty much like I've got to win three races and Max has to not finish three races in a way. So, yeah, it's check. And I'm all alone. And Max has all his pawns ready to attack me. But that's probably all I know. Yeah. Their job is tough. I don't think people realise how tough it is. You know, as drivers we always give… I mean, we give everyone a lot of abuse, you know, half the time! So it's probably one of the hardest sports to police in the world, I think. I don't know of every other sport, but I think it's a sport where there's so many things can happen. You want rules, but you also don't want rules. And that makes it very tough. And you're always going to have people that disagree and people that agree. So I think it's just a very tough position to be in. I don't know what's going on there. Obviously things are not running as smoothly as what we would want. But as such a big sport, like the majority and pretty much every other sports, you have permanent stewards, you have permanent people, you have a permanent team that run everything for consistency and many other reasons. That's all I know. Yeah, that's what we want as drivers. That's what we request. But we also acknowledge it's a very tough position to be in and to put yourself up for that role in the first place, I think, takes a bit of guts because you know you're going to get crap from every side at some point, and you've got to accept that. You've got to be willing to accept that. I don't think that's easy for anyone to do. We'll see, but I don't know anything more, honestly. But that didn't change the championship points, so... I feel like a lot of people try to come up with something here. I'm not saying you are, but we've never done something that harmed the team. I feel like people think we do. Everything we've done, we've just swapped a position. It's not hurt us, so it's not benefited us. It benefited me because I was in the fight for the championship and that's the game we also have to play, just as I've helped Oscar in a few occasions and helped him win in Baku, you know. I did my job there. But I think Andrea made it very clear from the beginning that we would never do something that would make the team result worse. So no, nothing is going to change. Yeah, I think going into a season with a mindset of let's try and win it, it's a very different mindset to what we had this year. It's been a different story throughout the season. We started miles off the pace. We started third, fourth, best team at the beginning of the year. We were for a long time. Red Bull were extremely dominant, more dominant than any other team has been for the rest of the year. We've been extremely quick and probably one of the quickest for the most part. But when we have been, it's been by a much smaller margin. So to create the differences that they were able to create in the beginning of the year, it's pretty much impossible. I feel like I've still done a very good job, but it's clear… One thing you'll always get from me is the honesty of whether I've done a good job, a bad job, or whether we as a team have done a good job or a bad job and I'll be honest with what I say. I think there's been plenty of races, there's been a good few where we didn't perform to the level we needed to do, as a team. Silverstone, for example, is one where we should have had probably a 1-2. And we couldn’t have finished further from a 1-2. There are sides where as a team we didn't perform at the level we needed to do as a world championship winning team but there's also been plenty of times when I've not performed at the level I need to perform at to win a championship. I probably wasn't outright ready to go up against Red Bull and Max. I think I am now, and it's probably too late to do that. Maybe there are other drivers in the past that were ready for such an occasion. But no one has gone up against Max so early on in kind of their career, halfway through the season, and put up, I think, a pretty reasonable fight. I mean, I'm there, but there's no one else doing it, you know? So I've done my best. I've not done well enough. And I've always admitted that. And I think Max is probably one of the best drivers ever in Formula 1 and I don't think you'll probably get a much better driver than Max ever in Formula 1 ever again. That's my opinion but that's what I believe in and for me to go up against that belief, to fight against that person that I know is so good, Takes a bit more than what I probably achieved this season, but I think what I've done since the summer break is closer to what I need to be, and I think that is close to being good enough to fighting for it next year.",Las Vegas,wednesday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, my emotions today have been a roller coaster, you know, with qualifying being really unlucky with that red flag. You know, starting P17, I knew that it was going to be a very tough race, but we stayed out of trouble. We made the right calls. We stayed calm. And we were flying. So all of these things together, of course, made that result possible. But I mean, unbelievable to win here from so far back on the grid! Yeah, I mean, it's very hard to pass around here with the new tarmac. There’s only one line that you can take. But, yeah, I just knew that I had to go for it. It's, of course, always easy to front lock, just trying to balance that out. And I had confidence on the brakes as well. That helps. And, yeah, Turn 1 is always a great corner to pass. I hope they enjoyed it! Yeah, I don't even know where to start, because my emotions today have been from almost trying to destroy the garage to winning the race. I mean, starting P17… I knew that we could have a good race, but in qualifying, I think it was quite clear that there was only one line that you could take. So I knew that overtaking was going to be quite tough. But yeah, in the race, we had a good start. That helped already. We had a good first lap. From there, we just picked off a few drivers here and there. Then I got a little bit stuck behind the train of Yuki, I think. Then we just stayed calm. It was still a very long race, naturally. We made the right calls. When some pitted, the rain was coming, we stayed out. which was very sketchy. And then I saw Esteban in front of me flying, like four seconds a lap faster and I was like, ‘I'm just happy to keep the car on the track’. I mean, at one point it was just red, like we needed a red flag. It was just undriveable, even on extreme tydes, it would have not been possible because of the banking of the track here, you know, it's filling up very quickly and it almost felt like I was driving a boat. Yeah, a jet ski. I think we could have had a jet ski. Definitely, yeah. Definitely have more cornering speed on a jet ski, I think. I was just very motivated to get a good race and just let the race pan out and see what happens. Because in a wet race, always some crazy things can happen. But soon, I was passing a few cars, and I had always one lap or two laps of free air. I was always the fastest on the track. So, I knew that, ‘OK, we are quick’. I just need to try and pass the guys to try and have a run to the front. I felt comfortable in the car. I feel comfortable in the wet anyway, but then when the car is also performing, it just doubles up and you can really pick up the pace. Well, when I got past Esteban in Turn 1. I mean, before that, the pace was there, I was just trying to build it up slowly. Because after the red flag, the restart was very fast. And then just when the Safety Car actually came out, I was starting to catch him a bit. But then the tires were, again, very cold. And then, yeah, in the restart, I got by. And from there onwards, I just tried to look after the tyres, because you never know what was going to happen to the end. The wear is always very high around here. But yeah, I felt good. The car was having a nice balance. Just had to be concentrated to not make any mistakes, because the surface was still slippery. I mean, this was now, of course, looking at it, it was incredibly important because in a way I was expecting to lose points today. So from now, I just want clean races to the end. I'm not thinking about clinching the championship in Vegas or whatever. I just want clean races. Yeah, well, I mean, of course, that was important. I wanted to, of course, win a bit sooner. But yeah, it's been tough for us. We always kept pushing. We didn't really understand why the others were so fast in the race, especially. Yeah, I've been trying a lot of things to improve the car. And I mean, starting P17 this morning, didn't look like we were going to win the race again. So yeah, it's an incredible result for us. A massive boost for the team, because honestly, it's been tough. But it is also a big strength of the team to stay calm and just try to work on performance and try to improve our situation. And I'm confident. I'm confident for the last three races that we can fight again, and especially in the race that we will be more competitive. There have been a few French drivers, so you can choose. Yeah, I mean, for sure, those two are definitely in my top ten list. But this one is definitely much more crucial than back in the day. There I had nothing to lose. I was not in a championship fight and I was coming from the back after the strategic mistake we had. Now there was a lot more at stake. So I had to be more controlled, more aware of the championship. So for me, definitely this one is the best one. And about the wet, I don't know, I just said to Esteban as well, it's like back in the day in go-karting, you know, the guys that were good in the wet, they're good nowadays also in Formula 1. And it always just, yeah. I was racing them as well in the go-karting and they were also good in the wet, you know, so it definitely is a thing that you pick up when you're younger, I think when you practice a lot. I think where we come from, it definitely rains a bit more than maybe in some other places. And yeah, you go out there, you practice, you get more comfortable, and you are definitely tuning your skills to be better. And I think you carry that, and of course, you evolve and become even better. And you use that to your advantage. Yeah, it was still very bad. I mean, in some places you could not even drive because you would bottom out quite heavily, even in the wet. So definitely something needs to be done for next year to make it better. Because I mean, I know a lot of people put a lot of effort in it. It's not to talk bad about the people. I know they always try to do the best they can to put the surface down. But for the cars that we are running currently, it's definitely too bumpy. And yeah, something needs to be done about it. Yeah, so of course, my family-in-law is Brazilian. And, I appreciate it a lot, meeting all of them all the time when I'm coming over. You know, it's, of course, quite a travel from Europe, but we always try to combine it with the Grand Prix and stay a bit… Well, we come earlier and we stay a bit longer. Also for Kelly, of course, to spend more time with the family. And yeah, I've been really welcomed very nicely within the family. Of course, there's a massive history as well with racing within the family. So it's really cool. Honestly, I really enjoy being around the Brazilian mentality as well. I think it suits me quite well. My Portuguese is still very bad. So maybe when I stop racing, I need to take some lessons. But yeah, it's always, when I come here also to Sao Paulo, it's a track that I want to do well. Naturally, when you have a bit of a connection to Brazil, it's cool. And when you can do a day like today, it makes it even better. I would say thank you very much. You served me well. You know, we have to take those lessons together. I mean, his girlfriend is Portuguese, so... I have a quick question here. I mean, I appreciate all of you being here, but I don't see any British press. They had to run to the airport? Or they don't know where the press conference is? Maxinho! Yeah, I mean, when you feel good with the car, I had a lot of confidence on the brakes because I passed a few people here and there. And I think that was one of these opportunities. I had a good restart. I was in the tow. And I knew that I passed a few people there before. So I was like, I'm going to send it up the inside. The camber of the corner helps you naturally a little bit. So, yeah, I just went for it. And then, of course, I saw that Esteban didn't make it too difficult for me, and he slotted in behind me. Otherwise, I think it would have been 25 laps of trying every time. I mean, honestly, I went for it, and I think it was also very nice how then Esteban handled the rest of the corner.",Sao Paulo,post-race,Red Bull
Esteban Ocon,"I mean, what a day that was, you know, after the difficult season. You know, it's really nice to be driving around here and having the performance a bit levelled out, you know, on the rain. Someone very important to all of us said a long time ago that in the rain, the cars are almost equal. And that phrase didn't age at all. Yeah, I'm very happy to be today on the podium. I think it's been awesome. And the support I received here from all the Brazilian fans is incredible. And yeah, I can't thank everyone enough. No. The car was extremely difficult, you know, on the dry. And really, you know, I felt at ease, you know, when it started to rain this morning and last night. I really wanted to get some lap on the rain. I love it here when it rains. And yeah, today has brought a special race for us. A jet ski. If you go on throttle, you can turn. Well, I was saying before, I'm not sure that is a reality or still a dream. But I smell champagne, so I think it is reality. But yeah, it's been an incredible day. Who would have thought, first of all, that we were going to qualify fourth, where we qualified. We were very, very quick as soon as these conditions pulled out today. It really levels out the field in here. And it feels great to be just able to fight with other cars, to fight with the guys that are at the front as well. And it shows that we’ve still got it. And when there's an opportunity, we are always there to be able to take it. Yeah, we were leading the race at some point. That was a special moment. I was pulling away from Max in that first restart. It was going super well. Unfortunately, at the end, a reality check came back and Max was still better than us. But, yeah, it feels extremely great and even greater now because we've had a difficult couple of races lately where things don’t really work the way we want for us. But it clearly shows, you know, that we’ve still got it when it's not all about the car and it's also about driving. No, not necessarily. I think we are normally better on the rain. It's difficult to be worse at times than where we are on the dry, especially lately. Don't laugh, please. But it's definitely great to be able to execute such a race. The team have been spot on on strategy calls, tyres, And when everyone is on a level playing field, we can play and here we were. Well, it's not signed off yet. There are more races to go, three more. But yeah, if that's the reward, then I'm very happy to call it that this is the reward. It's been five years of good moments, more difficult moments, of course. But, yeah, extremely happy and proud, you know, of me and Pierre, to be honest. We've had our stories at times, but it's been incredible to do that last formation lap. A lot of flashbacks came back to my memories, when we were racing on the wet in go-karts, when we were young, even in the snow with the slick tyres, we were both racing together and waiting for the podium or the win to come. And today, yeah, it tastes a bit like that. So, yeah, beautiful story from where we come from. And, yeah, that one will for sure forever stay engraved. Prost? Yeah, the era before, yeah. I want to know the guy that has bet on that. I think the grip is actually very good. You know, it's just some bumps that we run with these cars, probably if we were back in 2021 or 2020, it would have been fine. But these cars, you know, they run super low and all the heat is basically straight into the chassis, so there's no suspension in there. And yeah, I think it's much better than it was in terms of grip, but just the bumps needs to be improved. I mean, the support we receive here is incredible. I mean, this morning I was turning up to the track at around 5 o'clock in the morning, and people were waiting and queuing in front of the circuit, I couldn't believe my eyes that people are so passionate about it, about F1, about motorsport. And since my early days, people have called me Oconzinho, which is quite funny, I feel. But yeah, it's just incredible from the day we arrive to the day we leave. I would really like to spend more time in Brazil, you know, visit various places. But yeah, the Interlagos atmosphere in general never disappoints. It's just incredible. Yeah, Max clearly was quicker on that second stint, so there was no way for me to be fighting. He pulled away very quickly, as I thought he would have done. But yes, I told him after the race, I was very impressed on how late he could brake to the inside without locking up the front. That's what has happened to a lot of drivers. Probably in qualifying, 90% of my laps, I had the front locking into Turn 1. But yeah, he made it stick, and it was a nice move.",Sao Paulo,post-race,Alpine
Pierre Gasly,"It's incredible. It's incredible for the whole team. We had such a tough season. We struggled to score points. In these conditions, everything was possible. We believed it until the end. Two cars on the podium. I don't think anyone would have got that on that bingo card, you know, ahead of the season. So it's just fantastic. Yeah, I mean yesterday, the pace on the dry was good. I finished seventh. This morning we had a very poor quali, a couple of incidents, we didn't get a lap in Q2, so we started far, 13th, and we managed to make 10 positions, so now I'm absolutely buzzing right now and I'm just so proud of the team. To overcome such a tough season… It would have been too easy to give up, but we never gave up. And, yeah, here we are, both cars, P2 and P3, a lot of points for the team. And, yeah, everybody should be very proud today. Yeah, of course. I don't think anyone can understand. You know, it's a very personal relationship between Esteban and myself. But we've been going through so much. And as he mentioned, all these times we've had, like over winter, minus 5 degrees outside, we were the only ones showing up at the go-kart track, going out in the rain, in the snow, slick tyres, 9, 10, 11 years old. And we've really practiced these conditions. And on a day like today, I can tell you this actually made the difference, all that practice. I remember us getting back in the truck trying to get warm after a few laps because we were absolutely freezing. And it's just that we've had our ups and downs. But as you said, this two years chapter as team-mates, I think we can be very proud of the way we've pushed the team forward. It's been tough, obviously, this season, but we've always tried to push the team in the right direction to never give up. And on a day like today, even when the car has misbehaved for the majority of the season, everyone tried to put the A game, and it was just an historical day for the team. So very proud for everyone working in the team to achieve such a performance. Yeah, he was quite big in the mirrors. I must say it wasn't easy. It was difficult conditions. I wasn't at ease with the car balance. So I was kind of like fighting it a bit. But I always had him at bay. I don't think he ever had the idea of trying anything. So I knew as long as I keep him within one second, it'll be good enough. He damaged a bit his tyres. So it was a long end of the race, but we managed to hold him off. There was Lando at the restart and Charles as well. So we've had our fair battles during the entire race, which felt like an eternity, to be fair, with the red flag and in these conditions. But yeah, we managed to make the right calls, faultless drive and strategy and excellent day for the team. Yeah, I didn't know the stat. I heard it as well from some French people. It's quite cool. I like to hear that we are making things happen after quite a long time. All French people had to wait for a long time. But yeah, it's pretty special. Was it Jean Alesi with... Or was it Arnoux and... Arnaud and Alesi? Or Panis! But, no, it makes it very special. I mean, on a day, as I say, like today, for the entire team, for Esteban, for myself, on such a tough season. It's been very difficult for everyone at times. You’ve got to come every single weekend with the same mindset, the same approach, trying to put your best, even though you know that your chances are not really high. But it's important to never give up because, you know, especially on days like today, anything's possible. And I'm very grateful for all the work the team has been doing because it all makes it worth it on a day like today when we get both cars on the podium. I don't think anyone in the world today would have thought at some point this year, two Alpines are going to be on the podium. Well, if there is one, he's an absolute legend! That's what I love about Formula 1, that you get these type of opportunities. And you've got to show up. It's not guaranteed. Could have been many other guys that make it happen. But at the end of the day, it was Esteban and myself. They said it all. Muito obrigado. We have a common interest for the Portuguese classes. Just look at the crowd. Honestly, it's such an iconic racetrack. This year was also very special with the legacy Ayrton left and with the 30 years, so it was, as Esteban said, I think this morning at 5 AM, when my eyes were quite closed because I was still a bit sleepy, once I saw everyone queuing, and I was like, wow, that was very impressive. And the energy you get from these moments makes you very grateful. And to be able to live these moments And when you get these emotions a couple hours later, it's just a memorable moment that will, for sure, keep with us forever. That's a fair question! That's a fair question.",Sao Paulo,post-race,Alpine
Lando Norris,"Yeah, it was a lot going on today. But super, super happy, because I was struggling a lot at the beginning of qualifying. I had a lot of work to do. So I was not comfortable at all. So to end up on pole, I worked at it a lot through qualifying. I had a lot of areas I needed to improve on, but I did exactly that. A little surprised again. I mean, I've been surprised a little bit lately, but a little bit surprised to be on pole. But some nice laps. I felt good in the end and a good result for us. Very. Probably more than it looks on TV at times. It's just, you're always trying to find that next little bit, but I mean, you saw how many people were going off and crashing and locking up, so it was easy to end up badly, you know, and end up in a wall or do something where you might not even make the race later today, you know. So, that risk-reward was not easy today, especially from where I was in Q1. I found it very tough to know how much more can I push. So that's why I'm happy, because it's a relieving qualifying after something like this. So very happy at the same time. No eyes forward. I mean, I got some quick guys behind. George put in a nice lap. Yuki's been flying in the wet all day today. So it's never easy in these conditions. It's never as much as just settling down and getting on with it as that is what I would like to do. It's not always the easiest thing, you know. So we'll see. We'll prepare well. I hope we can get a race in. That will be a good start. And I'm excited to see what we can do. One hundred percent. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot more risk involved in a day like today. Especially because I was 15th in Q1. I was struggling. I was miles off the pace. I was like a second and a half off Oscar. I don't know what was going on. I was pretty concerned at the beginning. It was not looking good. So to be sat here now on pole, that's probably the thing that makes it sweeter. But it's also just these conditions. I mean, you saw how many people were going off and making mistakes, how easy it was to lock up and one lap just be gone and you'd be out. So any mistake today and you paid the price. And I think those are definitely days when things go right and you put in a good job and you do a good job that you feel happy about the whole thing. I didn't. It was the driver! The car was the same from start to finish. It's just your confidence and braking was just half of it. I was pushing too much half not enough. I just couldn't get comfortable with the car and. It was showing at the time, so I really didn't have a lot of confidence. You know I was one position away, one 10th away from being out in Q1. It could have been a very different story today uh but it was more just conditions and days like today you know when you got Yuki here and you got such a mix up in the order, it shows that it's not all about the car, it's about how who can get the tyres in and drive well, not make mistakes and that showed because of how bad I was at the beginning and how much better I did at the end. The car was the same. I was just driving terribly and then started driving well. I think the knowledge of where the grip was, was always pretty obvious. Let's say from the beginning, that's your first job as a driver is find the grip and then it's trying to exploit that. The thing that is tough and trickier is how easy it was to lock tyres into one and four, how easy it was to have one wheel spin. I think if I probably had one wheel spin, George would be on pole today. One wheel spin costs you easily one and a half, two tenths. So I got just a mega exit out of all the slow speed corners. I kept it clean. And I think just a clean lap was what got me pole today. People don't realise how easily things can go wrong, how quickly, whether it's a snap out of two. You know, what happened to Alex, what happened to Fernando, what happened to Lance. Even Yuki. There was a lot of places things could go horribly wrong today. That was the point I kind of said at the beginning, was the risk versus reward. It was very difficult to know, ‘okay it's a tiny bit wetter now, so do I push as much as before, because I want to risk it and I want to be on pole or do I take it a bit easier and just get the car home in one piece?’ That's always playing on your mind a little bit. But my approach was the correct one. Hopefully I just start as I ended. That would be the best thing. But I mean, the race is a completely different job. The conditions, I'm sure, are going to change. You know, it was much nicer when it stopped raining. People could get more laps in, and the spray was less. The spray was so much in the beginning. You know, you have to be almost 10 seconds behind the car in front in order to kind of see where you're going, see where the brake markers were, all of those things. You don't get those opportunities at the start of a race, you know. So yeah, difficult. But we'll find out later. I mean, it was a quick getaway last night when we were told it's a 7.30am quali. I think my alarm was on for ten past five. It's not a nice sight when you have to put that on in the morning. But I think I was asleep by nine. I had my best sleep of the whole week, which I wasn't expecting. Yeah, like I said a few times before, I don't normally eat on a Sunday. I don't have coffees either, so I had nothing to really get me going too much. Maybe that's why I had a bit of a slow start. I had a Nutella sandwich, and that was all. So nothing too different. I probably expected worse. But I think as soon as you jump in the car, your brain switches on, and you're kind of in that race mode. Adrenaline kicks in. So it changed a bit, for sure. You normally would have had nice poached eggs on toast. But this morning, the Nutella sandwich was good enough. I don't remember the exact video. In my Bambino, I was probably six years old. I can picture it perfectly. My dad is the answer to all of this. We used to have a lot of fun. Yeah, doing a bit of everything, you know. I didn't start on a track. I started just at home, around some cones. Yeah, it was quite a difference to now. I mean, it's hard to know how much of that helps nowadays, you know, when you're driving a Formula 1 car in Brazil. It feels very different to having slicks on a go-kart at home with, I don't know what, five horsepower. There's a large difference, but it all starts somewhere. And that little bit of knowledge, that little bit of correction and drifting, it has to start somewhere. And I'm sure nowadays, they're starting earlier and earlier, kids. And when I started, I had no idea on how to drive, and neither did my dad. Yeah, I think it helped. It's a starting point. And I used to enjoy a lot of that, driving on slicks in the rain. Because you can drift and you can have a bit more fun. You can take it a bit less seriously when you're like this. And that's almost how you have to drive. Yeah, days like that, tiny things along the way over the last, what, 18, 19 years of my life now since I was five, six years old. I'm sure all of it adds up slowly over time to make you a better driver. It's probably the same for everyone on the grid to be sat here today.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, absolutely. I mean, always love coming to Sao Paulo. Obviously, such great memories from a few years ago. And after yesterday, it was so tough just waiting and all the fans stayed out. And honestly, this morning, I was so impressed coming into the track at 6 o'clock. Everybody was queuing. Everybody wanted to be here. And really pleased to be lining up here P2. I love that, to be honest. Reminds me of the karting days, waking up, having breakfast in your race suit, and just going out there and driving. So, yeah, maybe the guys need to have a bit of a think about the format moving forward. Maybe this is the one, you know, qualifying Sunday morning. As I said, it was a great session, but let's see what we can do in the race. I had no wheelspin, that's why I was so close to him. Otherwise I'd have been a few tenths behind. But yeah, as Lando said, it was such a challenging session and you're only a minor mistake away from having huge consequences and it was so up and down. Again, at the start of Q1 we looked like we were out of the top 15 and then also just getting that one lap in at the end to be on the front row. So pretty pleased with that. It was exciting, to be honest. Obviously the more laps you get, the easier it is, but it's the same for everyone. I wanted to go all in for that last lap, so we decided to wait in the garage and just try and nail that last lap. And it wasn't easy, but it wasn't easy for anyone out there. So as Lando said, I think just getting a clean lap in and there just seemed to be no grip off the line. So it maybe a little bit difficult to race this afternoon. I think it's going to be difficult to race this afternoon. But obviously, probably the guys around me have got more to lose than we have. You know, they're all in their championship fights. So that gives us a small opportunity. Well, I think like Lando said, it was just so challenging out there and Lando was on pole and quickest in Q2 and Q3 and did a great job. And in Q1, he was a tenth from being knocked out. So it just goes to show how quickly your fortunes can turn, I think, in normal, circumstances. we know we're a good couple attempts off of these guys. Yeah, I mean, it definitely feels weird now because after qualifying, it feels like the afternoon. You look at your watch, it's half nine in the morning. But yeah, similar to Lando, sort of no breakfast. I had my standard coffee before, which on an empty stomach made the start of Q1 a bit tricky. So I'll do it for next time on a Sunday morning qualifying.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, it was very tricky. Certainly, I enjoyed it. I think we had a good pace from straightaway. Had a couple of mistakes, but yeah, had a bit of luck as well. I think overall as a team, including Liam as well, we did a really, really good job. Yeah, I mean, this track especially, probably is one of the trickiest tracks. Once you start building confidence and you try to over-push a little bit, you have massive consequences like we saw with multiple cars today. And I had one big moment, and luckily I was away from the barrier, but, yeah, it's certainly also the track you want to nail it. But, yeah, I feel much better than yesterday. The car felt good. I think we had a good pace in the rain as well, so it's a good place to start for today. Yeah, 100%. Yeah, we are slightly behind P6, especially Haas. So we need definitely catching up. And this is the moment that we want to maximise the opportunity. So yeah, as a team, we do as much as we can to score as much as possible.
__
PRESS CONFERENCE__ Yeah, very happy, obviously. But at the same time, it's going to be a long race. And it's going to be today as well, so I have to refocus. But definitely, overall, the team did a fantastic job, especially good turnaround from yesterday. It just felt weird throughout the week so far, and we made a lot of change to the car. And I think it's hard to compare between yesterday and today because of rain and dry. I think I got much better, I think. Yeah, definitely high, you know, in rainy conditions can be tricky to overtake or, you know, defend, but yeah, just to be clean as much as possible every lap. That's the main target, like we saw in qualifying. And yeah, I think both cars are in good positions, and especially we're fighting for P6, so I think this is a good opportunity to overtake again the Haas. Yeah, I think from yesterday, especially, these kind of things are very needed. But also yesterday, I think we know what happened there throughout. Straight away from FP1, just didn't have real grip and made a lot of change, the parts as well. I mean, it's hard, like I said, to compare, but it got much better, I think. Just needed a smooth weekend, you know, like probably from Austin, Mexico, didn't have any clean race week. Austin, you know, started really good. Didn't turn around towards ourselves, in Austin, for example, in the race. Mexico, just my bad in the qualifying. You know, there was good opportunity there, there was good pace, but just, yeah, I lost the opportunity for myself. So just needed like this very clean race week and I think still always confidence there. So yeah, I mean, some point in this qualifying kind of flashback, you know, in Mexico things happened in qualifying. It's kind of similar things happened in Q2 or Q3. And yeah, everything looks very slow when I was spinning. And thank God for the gravel that made me rejoin the track. But maybe I trained too much legs and I'm braking too hard and locking up. But yeah, so far it's definitely good. Yeah, I mean, I got the best qualifying throughout my career, so I would prefer every day, every time, 7.30 in the qualifying. But I was expecting, I mean, straight away, Q1, I got a good pace. So probably, I mean, preparation went well. I had a lot of coffee, a lot of caffeine. Made it a bit too excited in Q3, but it was good.",Sao Paulo,post-qualifying,RB
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was quite a tricky race, but I think the pace was very good because we could always follow within the DRS, and yeah, I'm quite pleased with that. Of course, it took a bit too long with Charles, but when everyone is in a DRS train it's very hard to attack. So I had to wait for some mistakes, and luckily they came, and I could use that to my advantage. And yeah, it was promising. It was good. Of course, this is race pace. Tomorrow it might rain as well, so there's a lot of unknowns, but today was good. I hope so. I mean, I still expect them to be really quick over one lap, but I hope we can limit the damage a bit with, of course, the five place grid penalty I have. Yeah, I think we had good pace, just I got stuck in a DRS train, so I had to wait for my moment to have a go at Charles. He had a few moments in the race, and then he made a mistake in Turn 1. So then I had a good run out of Turn 3, and I could get him. But yeah, unfortunately, a bit too late. But there was also not much else that I could do, because when everyone is just in a DRS train, you can't attack and that was it. But the pace was good. It seemed like we could at least be in that fight, which hasn't really been the case the last few races, so I think that's promising. Yeah, of course, but I was stuck in the DRS train, so you cannot pass. Yeah, it got tight. We were just getting close to each other, then we had to brake. Well, I must have been close with Oscar. Yep. It's difficult to tell. Also, in the rain, anything can happen. It's always quite chaotic. So yeah, we just have to wait and see, of course, what happens tomorrow. Dry or wet, it’s fine. I don't know. It's a bit difficult for me to answer. I'm busy with other things to improve. He's doing a great job at the moment in Formula 1, so that's great to see. I understand, of course, that it's very attractive for a lot of teams to have him, so it's up to the team also to see what they want to do. Yeah, nothing to add.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it was a bit tricky, to be honest. Very bumpy, as we know. And, yeah, the racing line was incredibly narrow. If you missed it by a tyre width, you're in all sorts of trouble. So, no, a great day from the team and a lot of points. So, I think we learned a lot for the race tomorrow as well. And yeah, happy. Yeah, I think optimistic. I think the pace looked OK, but the Ferrari was very quick at the start and Max was very quick at the end. So, yeah, let's see. I think we've got a few things we want to try and improve a bit for qualifying this afternoon for the race tomorrow, but I think we're in decent shape. Yeah, a bit of a tricky one. Like Lando said, it's always a bit hard to know how much to push, how much to save in that kind of position, especially on a new surface like this, that's not really had much racing. So a bit of a tricky one, but it hung on better than I thought. So, yeah, the car was feeling pretty good and, yeah, pretty happy. Yeah, we spoke about it before the race and when we were going to swap. The gap never really got big enough to do it at a convenient time, but that was always the plan at some stage. I think we pulled it off as well as we could. We got a bit close with Max under the VSC, but still the most points for the team, which is, of course, what we wanted. I mean, it's not as fun as winning. But, you know, I think, you know, I know the position that we're in. You know, we've been talking about this for months now. And, you know, this is really the first time that we've had to enforce it. So, yes, I would have preferred to have won. But, again, it's a Sprint. It's the same points for the team. And, you know, being realistic, I don't have much to fight for in the Driver's standing. So we knew this is something that could and probably would happen at some point. But yeah, I was fine with it. I don't know. I mean, it could be completely different tomorrow. It's very, very rare. you have exactly the same scenario. I think we've spoken for months now about working together and doing what's right for the team. And that includes both of us as drivers in the team. Yeah, I mean, we'll see what scenario we have in qualifying, where we qualify, and then we'll see what situation we're in in the race. But it's not… We've probably spent months planning a million scenarios now, but until you actually get into the race and see what you have, it's very tough to do. But I think, you know, we've showed multiple times in both directions that we'll help each other out when we need to. Yeah, it's not good. I hope we do something for the next time we come here, but the grip level is actually quite decent, just the consistency of the surface is very poor. It's probably the worst of the year. Yeah, Austin, I'm not sure, but it's not far off. So yeah, I think something does need to be done for next year. I don't know what I won, but thank you. I mean, I think we just demonstrated what the short and long-term objectives are. I mean, the long-term objective is to win everything we can. So I think that's quite clear. And in the short term, you know, there's two championships at stake and I'm really only involved in one. So that's where I sit with it.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, not proud about it, but we worked well as a team together, so I thank Oscar. No, but we've done a great job as a team. Today was the result that we wanted. Oscar deserved it. But, yeah, we're doing what we have to do. So I thank him and the team, and we had great pace. So looking forward to qualifying and the race tomorrow. It's tough. It was kind of like yo-yoing a little bit, I'd catch up and then I'd drop back and catch up. It's just the dirty air here costs you a lot of lap time. I felt a bit quicker, but I couldn't pass at the time. But I felt good. I think we were clearly quicker than the guys behind. It's just difficult in a Sprint race like this to know how much to manage and push and that kind of thing, but we executed it well. Yes, tricky to know. I think the longest run I've done this weekend is like five laps, so a few unknowns through the race, but I think it felt good. The wind changed quite a bit from today to yesterday, so that changed things around a bit. Difficult, but I think we were still strong as a team and the car was good. Yeah, it wasn't a straightforward one. I think our pace was good, but it's always hard to know when you're actually in the front in a race like today. For Oscar, it's hard to judge how much you push and use that kind of free air and clean air versus how much the tyres might start to degrade by the end of the race. And you want to keep the tyres alive. So a difficult position to be in, for sure. We knew it was going to be a difficult race to manage the tyres and keep everything in a good window. But I think we did that. So, yeah, I would have preferred having a much bigger gap behind, but that's the way it was. I don't know. I can't. I don't know. How am I meant to know? Not too bad. I think I definitely started to struggle a bit towards the end with the balance. and playing around with the steering wheel a bit to kind of change the balance around a little bit and try and avoid any mistakes. Yeah, and then just make sure at the end of the race my tyres are good and I could keep Oscar within the DRS because Max was not far behind. So, yeah, we helped each other out and Oscar obviously helped me a lot today, so I thank him for that. It’s meant to rain, so I have no idea what's going to happen there. I mean, if it stays dry, I'm confident. I think our pace is strong. I didn't feel like I maximised yesterday at all. So yeah, today's another opportunity. But I think we're in a good position. The car's performing well. But if it rains, it's anybody's chance. Yeah, I mean, we spoke through many different scenarios. Like Oscar said, it was tough to do that much earlier because the guys behind were pretty close. I think there was one lap, but it's hard to suddenly kind of plan that and execute it well. So I think we did the best job we could. We want both cars up there. And of course, the Safety Car put us under a little bit of threat, and we were lucky we didn't have to do it after. But there's always those risks in the beginning of the race, middle of the race, end of the race. It's not a straightforward thing ever. So we planned for it, and we executed it well. Oscar said it well enough. Yeah, normally the rain is not great in these conditions just because it's still a very fresh surface. There's a lot of oil and a lot of things that make it slippery. So I'm not expecting it to be easy whatsoever, but it provides good grip on a day like today. It felt actually quite quick today. You have that. The bumps, I mean they've not gone overnight, so less than ideal. I don't know how the tracks are made exactly but in how the cars are forced to be made nowadays every driver on the grid has complained. The cars we had a few years ago, you could get away with more of these things and you almost noticed it a lot less. The cars are made to be low. That is the regulation. The teams have to make them like that. And therefore, other things have to change around it. And one of those things is the tracks, because how it was yesterday, especially, made things pretty difficult for everyone. And it doesn't just put us under more physical discomfort. I'm not saying pain, but I'm just saying less than ideal bumps and stuff, for your head and your whole body. And also the car. The car has to withstand a lot of bumps and hits and things like that. And it's made to withstand a good amount, but almost as much as yesterday, not really. So the FIA know, and they're not happy with it either. So I know that they want to improve things for the future, and they work with us to try and do that. Yeah, Oscar said it well. We've helped each other over the last two years for different things. I think it's one of our strengths is we work very well as a team. I don't think there's probably any other team on the grid that work as well. So I'm proud about all of that. But yeah, like Oscar said, we're fighting for a Constructors’ and we're fighting for a Drivers’. And we want to help the whole team achieve both of these goals. Obviously, from a driver's point of view, it puts us in a slightly different position. I'm not proud to win a race like I did today, so I'm almost happy you congratulated Oscar on the win. It's not how I want to... Yeah, I'm not proud of it, basically. So, you know, I’ll work hard to go and do a better job in quali later and put myself in a better position for the race. We want to avoid it as much as we can but at the same time, you know, we sign up for this. We have to work together as a team. We get told what to do. We have a boss. And, yeah, we do the best we can to help each other out.",Sao Paulo,post-sprint,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon, everyone. I love coming here. I've been really excited about the trip and just getting back. Every opportunity I have to spend time here. You learn more about the culture. You are able to engage more. I know the Senna Foundation did an amazing event last night with all the great work that they're doing. And it's just the colours, it's Ayrton, it's the culture, the people. So you really vibe off that through the whole weekend. Well, I mean, every time we come here is an opportunity to do that. And I think so many of the drivers also do that. But I never in a million years thought I'd ever get to drive Senna's car here. I remember, someone contacted me, my manager told me about it, and I jumped at the opportunity. Back in the day, when I was at McLaren, I did get the chance to drive the MP4/4 around Silverstone, which was incredible. But just the thought of driving that car around here, if you look at the… I remember the races where he was, when he finally won here and held the flag and yeah, it will definitely be quite an emotional experience and I hope people are here to see it. I had a helmet made, his helmet, made for me, but I don't know if we're using that one tomorrow, but yeah, I think the initial hope was for it to be a surprise. So I had a whole white suit and his helmet and I'd go out and drive the lap and it would just look like it was him out there. But somehow it got out there. It's impossible to keep things quiet. I'm always heel and toeing. So it should be...! No, it used to be really good when I was younger, and when I did the MP4/4, I was able to do it back then. It's something I miss. I wish we had that in Formula 1. I mean, the two-pedal thing is just not exciting, and they need to bring back the H-Box. It was awesome. Confident. I mean, it's been a very turbulent year. I think we always arrive with confidence and with a positive mental attitude, but the car is just, I don't know how, I'm sure it's similar for the other drivers, but there's glimpses of hope and then things it swing back and forth, whether it's tyres, whether it's the aero. So you never know what you're going to get. I always feel like Forrest Gump when I say that! But then, yeah, I'm hoping the car… The last race was really positive for us in terms of the end result, but through the weekend it was definitely, with George's crash during the weekend and then I started with a bad start of the race, but then got better towards the end, so there's definitely potential within the car and we're always just looking to fine tune it and hope that we can extract more from it. And I'm hoping, with the new surface track layout here maybe we can have a better race. Of course that's what we would have all loved, to have been in the fight for the championship. That's what everyone works towards. We knew at the beginning of the year it was going to be tough as soon as we hit the ground and we didn't expect to also have some of the success we had. Obviously, Silverstone, everyone worked so hard to get that result, which I'm so incredibly grateful to the team for. But yeah, I know this team so well, and I know that the results and the position we're in this year will just only fuel them even more to work harder to have a better car next year. And no, I'm not really watching much up ahead, unless I'm in the battle or behind, like in the last race. I saw them for a second, and then they were gone. But yeah, I'm just focusing on trying to do the best job I can. I'm very interested in my future, of course. And so, in that respect, keeping an eye, yeah. Watching everything that happens. Of course. It's been, you know, through the year, the beginning of the year, you know, if you look at somewhere like maybe China already, but the Red Bull was like a second ahead. And it's been quite incredible to see the McLaren rise and then the Ferrari in the last few races, to see their progress and just trying to keep an eye on everyone's car and what they're changing and what they're adding. You know, we all watch the video, all the drivers, we all watch the onboard laps and we're always trying to see where we can gain time. And there's some cars that just react differently and better or worse in certain areas. And you're trying to figure out how you can find that within either your balance or get the team to develop the car in that direction. Well, I think he's done an incredible job, I think, to, last minute, be called upon and thrown into the deep end in this sport. The majority of us, if we're lucky to get in the sport, we have a bit of a run-up, if you look at, for example, young Kimi, for example, he's got a lot of test days before his first race. I think he will have over 20 days or something in the car, which is unprecedented. And as for this guy here, he didn't have that. So he just jumped straight in and he did a fantastic job. And it was really great to, as I said in the race, it's always great to see young people and young talented individuals get the opportunity to come through and shine. And I think he did that in the first race. We had a great little battle and it was super safe. It was hard but fair. And I think he's earned his right to be here. There still is a seat available. And he's saying it's not for him to decide. My advice would be to make sure that it is. I'd be pushing on my side to make sure I was doing absolutely everything… and at the end of the day he's got to just focus continue to focus on doing his job every weekend as he is. Hopefully he's got good people behind him who are doing the right job to make sure that he's here racing next year. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely, I think it's really exciting for the sport, firstly. The last couple of years, not necessarily so exciting, obviously, with Max just leading the way, and that sometimes happens. But I think it's been really exciting for the fans to see that it can go right down to the wire at the end of the year. There's still a possibility of Lando catching up. I read somewhere I think he's got to get 11 points more or something in each race or something over these next races, which is definitely possible with the performance they have. And yeah, I mean, we all know Max and his strengths and can't really say too many weaknesses, if any. And you've got, obviously, Lando, who's really rose to the occasion and has been really leading the team. I haven't really spent too much time looking at how they're racing and how they're positioning the cars. Obviously, everyone knows what happened in the last race or the last two races, but everyone will have an opinion on it. But at the end of the day, those two are the drivers. They know what they're doing. I'm really excited to see what happens over these next races. I'm just hoping that I can at least have a good seat view to watch it all as they'll be ahead. I mean we're kind of… Performance wise, we've been a bit no man's land, so we're not really receiving too much from behind or we're not really attacking too many at the front. So I mean the rules are still the same as they were back in 2021. So what we saw in 2021 with myself and Max is still happening today and will continue until perhaps they make a change. And also, the tracks, with all the run-off areas, don't help. If it was gravel or grass, they wouldn't be going all the way out there. So it'll be interesting to see the development. Hopefully they'll make some changes for next year. One of the cool things is I feel like I maybe play a tiny role in these races that appear. It was something I'd always said. They'd say, where you want to have a race and I always said Vegas. And all of a sudden some years later we had a race in Vegas. I think for our first race, naturally, there's always going to be, at any new circuit, there's always going to be learnings and things that don't go perfectly well. So the weekend as a whole, I think what happened with the fans and I can't remember exactly, but it wasn't the smoothest of weekends, but the race was incredible. And so going back now, I think they would have made so many changes and it would be even better. But yeah, definitely dancing under the nightlights was just incredible. We didn't have the car to be at the front, particularly that weekend, and so the car wasn't the happiest on the track like that, but hopefully a bit better this year. And then also, I've been talking about Africa, and we've got, potentially, Rwanda on the cards, which is amazing. So I just hope it comes in time before I'm gone. That's my biggest dream, is to make sure that I get to race there before I retire. I don't think so. I mean, I've raced for a long, long time, so I've been karting, and I wouldn't say that Formula 1's got any more aggressive. I mean, when I first got to Formula 1, I was racing with Fernando, who was very firm and tough to beat on track, and it was no different to now, I would say. I think the only difference is that the tracks now have these run-off areas. I think when I joined, we didn't have these big run-off areas, so when you first get in, you really had to build up to the limit. You couldn't go beyond it, go off track and come back on. And that's something I would say the thing I noticed the most when, so like for example, around maybe Max's time or maybe just before, where they started having these big run-off areas, where the younger drivers were able to come in and really abuse those areas and not put the car on grass, for example. And I think that gave them a real good cushion of bedding themselves into the sport and finding the limit as where, let's say, like from Fernando's time and before that, it was, you couldn't go beyond the limit. You're in the gravel. Pouhon, for example, Turn 10 in Spa, for example, there used to be grass right beyond the kerb and gravel, which was definitely worrying when used to go into a corner like that. So I would say that's been the biggest shift and It would be great to see the old school sort of way come back if possible. Gravel traps or something like that. Maybe not safe, but we'll see. I know that's where you would go. I mean, all you have to do is just go and look back and listen to some of my radio comments back in the day. It's not really something I really want to tap into. It's nothing to do with me at the moment, so... Obviously, if I was in the battle, it would be... I could lean in more into it, but these are the things you have to ask those two because they're the ones that it's affecting. But I don't think you're seeing much difference across the years from 2021 to now. It's pretty much the same.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Mercedes
Lance Stroll,"I mean, something from back in the day like that. You know, so much lighter than what we're driving now. And yeah, I think that's already huge. Just remove a couple hundred kilos from what we're driving now and it's a lot more fun. So yeah, something from back in that era. I mean, not really, because we're in a different situation to where we were last year. You know, we had a good car here last year, so when the car's good, those results come. When the car's less competitive, it naturally just becomes harder for those results to come. Let's see, though. It's a great track. I always enjoy coming here. It's got a great rhythm and flow, and it's a lot of fun to drive. And maybe a bit of weather to mix things up, which always makes it interesting and presents opportunity. What was the question? The battles? I think the problems, the tracks. You know, I think if we have these big run-off areas that, you know, cause drivers to just brake too late and deep and run off the track. If we had gravel traps and grass, I think that would just naturally sort those things out. And we'd see a cleaner, fairer racing. But also the guidelines, I think, have gotten very complex, where your front wing has to be next to the mirror of the outside car and vice versa if you're on the outside. And in the past, it was just if there was a portion of the car next to you, you'd have to leave the cars with space. And we're not seeing that as much anymore with these guidelines being more complex. So yeah, maybe something to think about for next year. But I think run-off areas are for sure a big issue.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think overall the pace over the weekend plus missing of course most of Friday didn't help. And yeah, you know, Mexico is quite sensitive also to the tyre behaviour. So I hope that we understood a little bit more from that what we can do to be more competitive basically on all tyres. Well, this has been a little bit the case for most of the season lately. Yeah, it's a bit difficult to explain why that is. I don't think it's just entirely up to us, but we'll see. I mean, we'll try to be as competitive as we can be, and every track is a bit different. Also here, new tarmac, so again, it's a few question marks. Yeah, I've heard that before in my career, so it's my tenth year in Formula 1, I think I know what I'm doing. I haven't heard anything yet. It's not discussed, but I know that I will have to take one at some point. So we'll see. I mean, I think every battle is good, you know. I don't think any is more motivating or whatever. You just try to do the best you can every single time that you go out there, really. No, I don't feel alone at all. I have good friends and family, so I'm good. I don't feel alone at all. Also a lot of good people. I think it's just you win some, you lose some. That's how it is in racing in general. And yeah, I like to win. I don't like to lose. I think not many people like to lose. And I think, yeah, I always just try to maximise the result. And like I said, some you win, some you lose. Well, I think in general we probably lack a little bit of pace, but for sure it could have been a lot better. But unfortunately we didn't get to really understand that in the long runs. It's always very painful, especially when it's a very tight battle with some teams and you're a bit on the back foot. You need to really maximize everything that you can, and we couldn't do that in Mexico. I mean, naturally, I would prefer to win by 30 seconds but that's not possible at the moment. But it's like Oscar said: it can be positive or negative for you when there are more teams fighting. So sometimes the point swing can be bigger. But I think for the sport, of course, in general, it's better. No, not really. Just try to do the best I can. Yeah. Of course, we want to win. We want to do well, but of course, it also needs to be possible. We still have a good lead. So from my side, just try to enjoy the moment. Try to just always optimise the performance. I think it's not that straightforward. Clearly, even between how many seconds that you get, so. I mean, like I said before, sometimes they work for you, sometimes they work against you. I think it's never going to be perfect because even if you remove rules, then you get into a battle, then you want more rules because it's not clear what is allowed or not. Then when you have too many rules, you want less rules. It just keeps on going left and right all the time. Do I think it's over-regulated? Probably yes. I mean, in general, the rule book is only getting bigger and bigger every single year. I don't think that's always the right way forward. Yeah, I mean, if I was Sauber, I would have signed him already. I mean, especially if that's anyway the future, you know, young drivers. And ‘26, big rule change. It's always good to get used to a team already for a year, make your mistakes here and there, get integrated well, understand the car a bit. You always feel much more prepared and comfortable when you then start in ‘26. Honestly, that is something that is always unknown. You think that one particular track is the best place to take an engine or whatever penalty, but it's never guaranteed. But yeah, it's a possibility. I don't listen to those individuals. I just do my thing. I'm a three-time world champion. I think I know what I'm doing. Honestly, I have my opinions. I don't need to share them. Yeah, well, I mean, I always enjoy being in Brazil in general. The track is great. Also, it's going to be very interesting now with the new tarmac, grip-wise, what it's going to give. Sprint race or not, I mean, that doesn't matter. Can it shake things up a little bit more, potentially? But also, I mean, we have to keep an eye on the weather as well at the same time. So I'm fine. I'm just happy to be here. It doesn't matter in what kind of format. Yeah, I mean, it's complicated to answer that because he's still contracted to Williams. And of course, he's doing a great job. I think also Williams is probably scratching their heads a bit about what to do with Franco. But for me personally, it just shows that I think teams in general just need to be more open to put young talents in and trust them. Because now you have this kind of situation where he's a Williams junior and potentially has to leave or try to find luck elsewhere, right? While, they could have put him in the car. So, yeah, it's complicated. I mean, whatever he decides or his management decides to do, I mean, does he deserve a spot on the grid? I think with what he has shown so far, yes. But, yeah, it's not easy to find a spot at the moment. Yeah, I mean, in general, I mean, I think it would be great to have a race on every continent that we have. And I know that it was almost happening and then it didn't. So, yeah, of course, would be great to have a race and you're going to run. I'm sure they are putting a lot of time and money in it, you know, to make it a success and also promote the country. So for sure. People that are objective and close to me and not just there to stir… I can't say the word, because I'll probably get another… I mean, apparently it only counts for me anyway, because, you know, after the race in Mexico, someone was swearing. I didn't hear anything from it. So, it's better I don't swear again. But, yeah, you know, some people are just being very annoying. And I know who these people are. I don't really pay a lot of attention to them anyway. And I think I've got to this stage in my career with the right people supporting me and making my own decisions. Yeah, so I think I know what I'm doing. Good people, with a good heart. Yeah, but I know. That's the most important. You know, some people are just a bit biased. And I mean, I get it. It's fine. But it's not my problem at the end of the day. You know, I just continue with my life and I keep performing. Well, I think since China, you know, for us it's anyway been quite difficult. Other teams have definitely caught up. They have had quite good performance upgrades. And even for me it's been hard to be on the podium consistently. So, yeah, I think as long, you know, we improve our card and it will also help Checo, naturally. So that's what we're trying to work on. We don't really talk about Formula 1 too much. I don't think he wants to. I don't think I want to. We talk about other stuff in life, which is anyway way more important. Well, there are many, but there's no need to name them right here. I mean, I just trust the people around me that are honest with me and that have a good heart, you know, that mean well and not just there to stir some kind of stuff. Yeah, that's how I'll name it.",Sao Paulo,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, quite a lot happier. I think in Austin we had a car that was quick but very, very difficult to drive. And I think in qualifying, especially, it was tough to get the most out of it. In the race, just going a bit slower with the lap times, it's maybe a little bit easier to get the pace out of it. But I was much happier in Mexico, which obviously the results don't reflect. But yeah, felt much more comfortable and, yeah, kind of made qualifying even more of a shame, really. But I would rather, you know, in some ways have a weekend like Mexico where I'm comfortable at least and knowing that I made a mistake rather than a bit more in Austin where just struggling to get the most out of the car. Good question! I don't know. Not much, obviously. It's doing what it's supposed to do from what I've heard and what I've seen, which is always a good thing. But it's not transformed the car, I would say. So hopefully it's just a little improvement. I would say, no. I think we always knew that Ferrari were going to be a threat. And I think, you know, since Monza, basically, they've had a very, very quick car. Just some of the weekends, the results haven't shown it. So for us, it's not been a huge surprise that they've been as quick as they've been in the last few weekends, especially. So we'll see if that run continues. But we knew to expect a fight, definitely. So, yeah, it's going to be an exciting end to the year in both championships, I think. I mean, I think it's possible. You know, it's certainly not an easy task. And, you know, in some ways it's, you know, it's up to both drivers. What happens, obviously, it's, you know, Lando can't just win every race and have Max finish second because Max will still win. So it depends a bit on the results. You know, it's obviously a very tight fight with the top three teams and Mercedes occasionally now still, so the swing either way can still be quite big at the moment I would say. I think it's possible it's going to be tough but I think it's doable. I mean, I think, yes, there probably are some tweaks that need to be made. And, you know, the FIA has acknowledged that and wants to work with us on that, which is very positive. But I think in general, we've got more consistency, maybe some things can still be a bit more consistent, but I think at least for the Stewards, they now have a set of, they actually have a set of guidelines as to what kind of rule should be applied. I think we all agree that the rules may be not perfect and should be changed a bit. But at least we have something to look back to, which we didn't have before that. So I think things can always be improved. These guidelines haven't been around for that long in the grand scheme of things. Again, you can't write rules, especially in racing, that are going to cover every single possibility and situation. So you always do need a kind of subjective steward to add their thoughts. But yes, I think we're in a much better place than we have been. And the FIA has been very, very supportive of trying to change that with us. I think he's been doing a very impressive job. Obviously winning F3 as a rookie last year and now leading the championship in F2. So yeah, I think from my point of view, when you're achieving those kind of results, you deserve to be in F1. And I have the personal experience of the pain of not getting a seat. So for his sake, I hope he doesn't have to go through that. I don't think anyone will ever go through quite the extent that I did. But I think he's been doing a very good job. Yeah, if he's doing it on merit, then I think he deserves a place in F1. Not massively, I don't think. I mean, personally, I didn't think it was that much different. It depends on, I guess, sometimes the people involved. And not everyone races in exactly the same way. I think we're all very, very hard. But I didn't really notice a change, personally. There was obviously the contact with Liam and Checo, which was very, very hard. But I don't think it really changes. You know, there are these guidelines out there, but I think, you know, there's a few kind of principles, I guess, we have as drivers, which is one, you don't really want to crash the car because it hurts and it costs money. And also, you don't want anyone to overtake you. So to then think in the moment that, ‘I'm just going to release the brakes to get ahead at the apex and not worry about the consequences’ or whatever, like, it goes a bit further than just what's written on a piece of paper, I think. Maybe some people will race a bit differently with some of the Stewards' decisions, but that happens with every incident. It kind of sets a precedent no matter what it is. So I don't think it will change that much, but we'll see.",Sao Paulo,thursday,McLaren
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, I think, well, it's just a part of the career and you have good moments and obviously it's always bad moments. Yeah, it's been not helpful from that perspective. Yeah, I try to minimise the distraction and try to focus on the racing. I'm trying to hope that I get luck from that. But yeah, so far it's not the races I'm having. But every race is a new race week. Not thinking anything about the previous race weeks. Just having a Sprint qualifying race. And yeah, we just focus now on beating Haas. Well, definitely like, for example, previous race with Mexico, we're definitely performing better than probably other tracks. Yeah, definitely Haas also picked up pace in the qualifying. So I don't know if it's better or worse, but at least we wer similar. And yeah, it's the race week that probably I shouldn't miss the opportunity. And there was qualifying that I didn't go well and didn't really maximise the opportunity. So definitely it's on me. And yeah, those things probably, yeah, the package was there, but just I didn't really maximise it. So I think in terms of car, Mexico was at least similar. Others, I know it's maybe we're a little bit behind because I think they're faster at probably every track so far. But yeah, we're going to hopefully develop much better in the coming races. And yeah, hopefully we can be at least in a similar level as them. Yeah. I think definitely, I mean, it's always the driver you want to drive with. He's the best driver so far and he has a lot of skills and definitely would like to learn a lot of things. But also, I would just finish as a learning and yeah, see how it goes. I just focus now on what I have to do. And so far, I'm just not really able to achieve what I want to do. So, yeah. We'll see how it goes. Yeah, I think it's better to also get an opinion by the drivers who actually race in previous years or probably more experienced, I would say. Yeah, even like drivers, if we can find someone that actually, probably all Formula 1 drivers knows and we all know that he's a driver that we can trust, I'm sure he can have good views or similar views as us. So I think if this feels like now, we just have to stick on guidelines and drive very safely. So yeah, I think we need someone who can advise very fairly and who can trust from our drivers. I mean, he's definitely doing a good job. And I mean, to be honest, I don't know much about those things. And yeah, I didn't see much. Yeah, definitely. It's actually, if it's not an option, I'll be surprised, right? Because he's doing well and he don't have so far, he don't have a seat so far for next season. And if he's fast, I'm thinking for all the teams he will be an option who don't have selected a seat yet for next year. So yeah, I think so.",Sao Paulo,thursday,RB
Charles Leclerc,"It was a difficult one. On the first stint it was all about trying to manage the temperatures, which was quite difficult. But, yeah, at the end, we did the best race we could do today. I was... I mean, the whole weekend I've been a little bit on the back foot. So third place was the best we could achieve on my side today. Amazing race by Carlos today. and yeah, it's a good weekend overall for the team, which is positive. I know we are working super well as a team. I think it's been quite a few races now that we are coming back to the level we should be at and it's amazing to see. Obviously, the Constructors’ is still our target and with weekends like this we are getting closer to it. So, I hope we can continue in that direction and get that Constructors’ title, which is very important. Yeah, I mean, all in all, it's been a really positive weekend for Ferrari, a little bit less for me personally. I haven't been on my top game this weekend, but having said that, I think Carlos has been doing just the perfect weekend from the first lap in FP1 to the last one of the race. On my side, I was a little bit on the back foot, missing FP1, and I never really recovered. During the race, I felt like I was relatively quick on the first stint. Unfortunately, I had to do... I was requested to do quite a lot of management for temperatures, but yeah, at the end it was the way it is. I think I'm very happy for the team, very happy for Carlos. He deserves it more than anybody this weekend because he's been driving better than anyone. And yeah, a good result for the team. Nothing really, sometimes you get into the car and the feeling is perfect and sometimes you just have to work a lot harder for it and that's what happened this weekend. And obviously they was quite a limited amount of running for me because the whole FP2 was on prototypes and Pirelli testing and then FP3 was all about trying to get back into the rhythm but I never really managed to do so. So yeah, I was just not fast enough. Of course, I could see Carlos was right in front, so there you start to think about the win straight away. I was feeling really good at that moment of the race, so you do, but then quickly I understood that it would be a lot trickier than that with all the management I had to do, but again, I don't think anyway I had the pace to beat Carlos today. Do you think you had the pace to beat Lando? Or what happened on lap 63 was inevitable given the pace of the car? Oh, by then I had no chance to stay in front of Lando. Lando was flying, and I think as a team, we've been pretty lucky that whatever happened with Max and Lando at the beginning of the race, that slowed him down massively, and his second stint was very, very impressive. So that was a good thing for us, and that probably helped us. On my side, there was no way that I could stay in front. I knew that it would be very difficult. I knew that I had to have an incredible exit out of the last corner, so I tried to put everything... to have a really good exit, went over the limit, lost the car and lost the position, but I felt it was a question of laps or corners before I lost that position. Yeah, of course it has to be our target, because we don't have to think about it every day. And I think the best way to achieve it is by just focusing on our own self and trying to maximise the package of our car, which is what we have done since two weekends. But yeah, the Constructors’ now is realistically possible. And it relies on us doing well more than others doing something wrong, which I've often said is probably the case for the Drivers' Championship. For the Drivers’ Championship I need to do everything right and I need a lot of bad luck to happen elsewhere. So the Constructors’ is definitely our main target and if we continue in that form it's a realistic one. Oh, I mean, I don't know which face I did, but it had to be a pretty stressful one because when I lost it… I knew that I had to do everything perfect. I mean, Lando was so quick at that time. So again, I felt like it was a matter of laps, but I was still trying to do everything possible for him to overheat behind me and keep him as long as possible behind me. So, I tried to have the best exit possible. I could see that he was very close out of that corner. I lost the rear and then you forget about Lando and you just hope that you are going to take it back. I had one oversteer and then when I recovered from that oversteer, I had an oversteer from the other side and then I was like, ‘*****’. Oh, sorry! Oh, no, oh no! I don't want to join Max! Then I was just hoping to bring the car to the finish line and get that third place. Again, I welcome Max being as aggressive to Lando as possible because it helps me, at least it gives me chances to be closer to Lando in the Drivers' Championship because it's still a fight. If anything, it's more a fight, Lando and myself, than with Max that has quite a lot of advantages in points. On my side, I don't think about the Drivers' Championship, realistically. As I was saying earlier, I think first the approach is not to start thinking about the Drivers' Championship. That doesn't help me achieve anything more. It's by focusing race by race. And more than that, I just feel like it's not in my control whether I win the drivers' championship or… Let me explain better. Of course, there's part of it that is in my control. And if I win all races, that puts most of the chances on my side. But even if I do that, I've got to have Max that has very poor weekends and I don't rely on that, so I'll just try and do the best possible end of the season, and then we'll do the math at the end of the season.",Mexico City,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"It was a very tough race. You know, the first few laps, a lot of it was just trying to stay in the race and avoid any crashes. But Carlos drove a very good race, so congratulations to Carlos and Ferrari. They were very quick today. So, I tried. I tried my best. And a big thanks to all the fans. The fans make it very enjoyable here. So, yeah, a big thank you to everyone. Yeah, I mean, I knew what to expect. I didn't want to expect such a thing, because I respect Max a lot as a driver, but I was ready to expect something like this, and this is, yeah, not very clean driving, in my opinion, but I avoided it, and it was a good race. I just keep my head down, you know. I'm doing my best. We're doing a very good job as a team. I think today we were probably the quickest in the end. But we'll keep our head down. That's all I can do for now. Focus on ourselves and we keep pushing. Very, very pleased. I'm happy with P2. Normally I wouldn't be, but I think on a day like today, I was happy. Things looked like they could go a lot worse, especially the first part of the race. So to keep the car in one piece and to kind of keep the race alive was important. And the pace was extremely strong you know. A shame that we lost so much in the first stint with some of the battles that we had. If I was a bit more in there and in the mix then I think our opportunities could have been even better. But Carlos drove the first stint very well and the gap was already 15 seconds, so I had a lot to try and catch up. But it was a good race. The car was strong. Our pace, especially in the second stint, not really the first, but the second stint was very, very good and kind of gave me a bit of hope again that we were competitive comparing to the Ferraris. Until then… They've been pretty dominant this weekend, you know, so a good race. Would have loved to be on the top step and it looks like a cool podium here. It was a cool podium, but I'm very satisfied with the P2. I don't think I need to say much. Yeah, I think it's pretty self-explanatory on what happened. You know, I did everything I've been told in terms of what the rules are and the guidelines and all of this stuff, yet it just wasn't to be. And, of course, he got some penalties for that. But, you know, I think... I always, like I said before in some of the interviews, I go into every race expecting a tough battle with Max. It's clear that it doesn't matter if he wins or second, his only job is to beat me in the race. And he'll sacrifice himself to do that, like he did today. But I want to have good battles with him. I want to have those tough battles, like I've seen him have plenty of times. But fair ones. It's always going to be on the line. It's always going to be tough with Max. He's never going to make anyone's life easy, especially mine at this point of the year. But I think today was just… It was not fair, clean racing. And therefore, I think he got what he had coming to him. Probably, yes. I mean, we talk about different things. It’s not my job. it's got nothing to do with me in a way. Today I felt like I just had to avoid collisions and that's not what you feel like you want to do in a race. He's in a very powerful position in the championship. He's a long way ahead. He has nothing to lose. People can say it's the other way around, like he's got everything to lose and it's all for me. But it's not the case, you know. So it's not for me. I'm focused on myself. I'm doing my own job, which was a good job today. And I'm happy with all of this and I'm happy with my whole weekend. But it's not my job to control him. He knows how to drive. And I'm sure he knows that today was probably a bit over the limit. I mean, I'm 47 behind still, so it doesn't feel like I'm much closer than what I was, but every point helps. Charles got fastest lap at the end, so that’s one point they took away from me, but... Yeah, I don't know. I'm just doing my own thing and focusing. And as a team, we're doing our own thing and focusing on ourselves. A lot of people against us, but we'll keep pushing forward. I mean, I'm not happy today because of that. I'm happy because I'm P2, but... Austria, no one should have got a penalty, I don't think, I would say. Yeah, maybe some of my views are a little bit different now than what they were back then. Austria, I don't think anyone should have got a penalty. Austin, I don't think anyone should have got a penalty. Yeah, let's say we both kind of did things wrong. I feel like I was made to do something wrong, and I wouldn't say I… The majority of people, the majority of drivers feel like that was the same thing. That's why you've heard of some of the rule changes that might be coming and those types of things. It's because there's a common consensus that it wasn't correct what happened in the result that I had last weekend. Today, I think, was another level on both of those cases. Yeah, it was another level on both. I was ahead of Max in the braking zone, past the apex. I am avoiding crashing today. This is the difference. I can't speak for him, and maybe he'll say something different. But I think today was a step too far from both of those, and it was clear that the Stewards agreed with that. So I don't see it as a win or anything like this, but it's more that I hope Max acknowledges that he took it a step too far. I've always fought fairly. That's who I am. That's who I am as a racer. That's my way of driving every day. Maybe sometimes I've lost out because I've been too fair and not aggressive enough. And that's where I have to find a better balance. And those are the things, the changes I've said I've had to change since last weekend and the course of this year, that when you're racing these top guys, you learn things and you have to understand better these balances of attacking, defending, risk management, aggression, all of those types of things. But, yeah, for me, I don't need to worry about them. It's got nothing to do with me, in a way. I mean, I'll do what I can. I'll race fairly. If he doesn't, then things will go like they did today. But I think he wants to race fairly. I hope he does. I think he enjoys those moments, too, when it's a fair battle, but... Yeah, all I can do is keep doing what I'm doing. I feel like I'm doing a good job and we'll see what happens. I mean, you can see how far he went off the track. Yeah, I didn't need to let Max through. I was ahead at the apex of 4. I had to avoid him crashing into me, and then 7 was the same thing again. The thing is, what I didn't understand, like what didn't come earlier, was he overtook off the track. It wasn't that it was... I mean, it was also overly aggressive and those types of things, but he overtook off the track. I don't know what the wording of the penalties are and those types of things, but, yeah, I mean, he says he drives to the rules. That was his main thing he said after last weekend, and today he took by going forwards off the track. We'll see. Max will be back next weekend and I expect just more tough battles.",Mexico City,post-race,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Gracias, Mexico. Yes. It's incredible to see this crowd. I've been feeling their support all week. I feel like I have a lot of fan base here in Mexico and they gave me a lot of strength to do the weekend that I've done. Honestly, I really wanted this one. I really needed it also for myself. I wanted to get it done. I've been saying for a while I wanted one more win before leaving Ferrari and to do it here in front of this mega crowd is incredible. Now four races left, I want to enjoy as much as possible, and if another one comes, I will go for it. I didn't prepare it, to be honest. I was just a bit annoyed at the start and having lost position to him. And I said, I need to surprise him one way or another because Max is super difficult to pass. He's proven it many, many times. And yeah, I was a bit far back, but I said, I have nothing to lose. I'm just going to send one down the inside. And I've been very confident and breaking into turn one this weekend. And I knew I could make it. Yes, I have noticed all weekend that it could be my weekend. I also have all my family here watching me this weekend and I wanted to do it in front of all of them. What a weekend. What a day from pole. Yeah, really special. I felt like this weekend was going to be a very good opportunity to win that race. And yeah, I had a very good feeling coming into the weekend. Also, obviously very determined to win it. I knew coming into it that we might have a chance to win. And I've been focused, been on it all weekend. On top of that, I knew my family was coming and my best friends, my girlfriend, a lot of people were here to support me. And I said maybe destiny has something ready for me this weekend, that my maybe last win with Ferrari can come in front of them with all the support that I had from them all this year and in a great podium, a great place like Mexico City. I've been driving well and I made it stick and you cannot imagine how happy and proud I am right now. It was extremely emotional. I did shed a tear, you know, in the Spanish anthem. Yeah, for sure it's one of the best moments in my career. My mum had never been present on a race win with me, and the fact that she was coming here this weekend, I wanted really to win a race in front of her. And yeah, on top of that, the way the whole weekend planned out, it was just perfect. And, you know, with that move… Losing at the start and then having to fight back with Max just made everything a bit more tricky. Probably makes it taste even better because I had to work hard for it. And to do this weekend in front of all of them was incredible. Yeah, I didn't get a good start, but at the same time, I think Max, you know, tends to start very well. Max and Red Bull on low-grip tracks and here is very low grip. And whenever there's low grip, the Red Bull tends to start really well. So I was kind of prepared also for a scenario where Max was going to go alongside me into Turn 1, I braked as late as I can break, and he brakes as late as me, and I had no space to go into Turn 2. And from then on, I didn't lose my head, and I knew that every half opportunity that I got to the lead back, I would try and do it. And yeah, you know, with Max, you need to be determined, you need to be decisive. If you're not, you're never going to pass him. And in that case, I think I caught him a bit by surprise and I could make it stick. Yeah, high tension at that point also because then that initiated a fight behind me that nearly got me involved also from what I heard. So, yeah, it was an exciting moment of the race. Isolated, completely, yeah. The only misfire I had all race was at the exit of Turn 3. Landing after the curb, I did a little short shift and it gave me a misfire, which was a bit scary, but we've had them during the weekend and we know it's due to the altitude and the mapping. But once I was in the lead, I was trusting my pace, my management, and I knew this weekend I've been very quick and I knew I just had to do whatever I had planned and the win was possible. Towards the end, McLaren and Lando proved that they are still fast and they're still very quick and very difficult to beat, but I'm glad that we got fastest lap with Charles and a lot of points for the championship. I felt like it. And that's why at the time in the heat of the battle and the moment, I obviously opened the radio to give my opinion about the situation. And I felt like potentially, especially after being 1-2, which was a dream scenario, and exactly where we wanted to be after Turn 1. It happened a bit later, but in the end it happened. I felt like, yeah, the ideal was to obviously make it to the target lap and obviously keep our tyres alive. So I gave that opinion in the heat of the battle, but honestly, I also understand why Charles obviously was there behind and trying to speed me up, because that's what you do when you're P2 and when you also want to win, so yeah. Racing situations, heat of the battles, heat of the moment, but nothing that has never happened before, also from my side, so I completely get it. It's a good question, and please let me enjoy Mexico before I think about Brazil, because I'm going to enjoy tonight. And as I said, I want to enjoy this one. I want to let it sink in and enjoy. I think from now on we can dream and dream about the championship, dream obviously about the constructors and yeah, we can think about Brazil tomorrow. Today's time to enjoy. Probably catching him a bit by surprise because I was quite far back but before Turn 1 I got a really good tow on DRS, but I saw that I was probably going to be a bit too far back. But then right in the last 100 metres, I felt like I had a good momentum and I've been feeling very confident braking into Turn 1 this weekend. The car has been giving me good confidence to brake late there and I just went for it and it happened. Yeah, also this mentality of knowing I had a bit less to lose in that battle and that I could be aggressive and send one. And yeah, I'm glad it happened because I needed to get back to P1 to then set my pace from there. It was an amazing podium. I had never been on the podium in Mexico, and I must say it's one of the best of the season for sure with the atmosphere there is and how passionate the Mexican fans are. From here, I just wanted to thank them all because this weekend I felt a lot of support from all the Mexican fans in the hotel, arriving to a track, leaving the track. I don't know if it's the language, the fact that I'm Latin like them, but I do feel a lot of their support, and yeah, they make me feel like home, you know? Thanks to all of them, and, yeah, viva Mexico. Yeah, I think we both believe it is possible and we are actually talking about it more and more often now. We pump each other up a bit, knowing that there's a chance and we are like, ‘yeah, come on’. You know, we have a good relationship and I think we both know there is a chance and we both know we are in a good moment in our driving, the way we're driving. And yeah, I think one of the keys is going to be consistency and having the two drivers always up there. I think this weekend, We did a really good job on that on a tricky track where you could see Q1 and Q2 was a bit of chaos and anything could go right or wrong. So we just need to keep ourselves in that fight. And as Charles said, don't get obsessed with it because it's not like it depends only on us. We also, given how fast McLaren is, depend a bit on them. But yeah, we're going to keep doing the best we can and keep pumping each other up to win it. You have your wallet here? Yeah, it's been a strange year in that sense, and yeah, also quite a challenging one. The year started really well, then we went through a tough period of development, and then suddenly we managed to make the car competitive again, and I saw that winning chances were still again [available], but obviously Charles took those wins in Monza and Austin, and I felt like, yeah, I also won before I leave, and I want to make that happen. I think it could have been quite easy for me to lose a bit of motivation and to lose a bit of the drive to make it happen, but those three weeks of break served me well. I managed to regain a bit of the determination and the drive that I needed for these last five, six races of the season. And I managed to put myself in a position with improving my driving, my confidence with the car, to put myself in a position to, first, win in Austin that I didn't make it happen – Charles did a great job there – and put myself in a position to win here and this one I was just going to make sure it doesn't slip from my hands. but yeah not an easy one not an easy year but proud of the way that I've managed to keep myself in it and obviously trying to help the team now as much as I can to to win these constructors because it would be the perfect goodbye for me.",Mexico City,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"It's always tough to say but I'm pretty happy with third, honestly. I feel like I got to the limit of the car quite quickly, which made us look good, but I struggled to get a little more out of it in the final two laps. So, Carlos and Max did good laps. They've been, specially Carlos, they’ve been very quick all weekend. Yeah, I'm happy with third. It's tough to say. None of us have done proper long runs on the tyres that we're going to be on tomorrow. So, there are question marks for all of us. But Ferrari have been very good in quali and long-run pace over the last couple of races. So it's going to be tough. But we're in a good position. So looking forward to it. Thank you. Not good enough, clearly. Honestly, I'm, let's say, relatively happyish still to be P3. Not a great day, yes. I mean, I missed obviously FP1 and then with the alternate tyres, so I felt like a bit on the back foot, probably not as much as what Max was, but not been that comfortable at all. And found some good steps into qualifying. And obviously Q1 and Q2 were very good. But I mean, I found the limit very quickly. And I was happy to find the limit. And things were good. But just couldn't progress from there. The car was too difficult to drive in Q3. Too difficult to get especially three tenths out of it comparing to Carlos. So happy with third. For a minute, it looked like it could have been better. But I think we finished where we should be. I was at the limit. I couldn't go any quicker. It's more I think the others just didn't get the most out of it. Yeah, pretty much every corner I was close to locking up and making mistakes. And I did that in my Q3, run 1 lap. But I had definitely nowhere near close to three tenths left in the car. So it was more that they just went quicker. I was at the limit. I got everything out of the car already in Q1 and Q2. Made us look like the ones to beat. But honestly, since FP1, Ferrari have been the guys to beat. And Carlos is on top today. So challenging to beat them tomorrow. I mean, the race pace is always a tough one to know. The last few weekends, they've been extremely quick and quicker than us, so it's... I don't have the confidence to say, yes, we can just beat them on pace. Like today, not on their level. But tomorrow's another day. You know, if we can have a good start, hopefully it's exciting down to turn one. Yeah, Carlos is going to be fast. Like he said, he's got nothing to lose. And they've been fastest for the last few weekends. So we'll try our best. But I don't think we have the pace comparing to them at the minute. No, it's delivering exactly what the team expects. So it helps. But yeah, if it was a two or three tenths upgrade, I think it would easily be P1. But we're talking about tiny things. And it's a lot less than probably what people think on the outside. When you talk about upgrades, you normally think of one, two, three tenths. And it's not even that.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, quite a lot. I mean, yesterday I barely did any laps, so... Yeah, we were playing a lot of catch-up. FP3 was not very good. So I was already, I think, under a lot of pressure to have a good qualifying, and then, of course, my lap time got taken away, so it added a little bit more pressure. But, yeah, very happy to be on the front row. I honestly didn't expect that to be possible. It’s probably one of the hardest tracks to get right. I mean, street circuits are difficult, and this one as well, because as you said, low downforce, it's very easy to have a lock-up or a slide, and the tyres overheat immediately, so it's one of the tricky ones on the calendar. Yeah, I mean, yesterday I did, like, four laps, two laps on lower fuel and two laps on high fuel. So it was basically just a complete write-off, no information. So, yeah, for me, FP3 was very crucial. Tried to do as many laps as I could and, yeah, we were behind. I mean, the car was not feeling great and everything was just very difficult. So I knew that it was going to be a tough qualifying, but we made some final adjustments. It all started to feel better, but to be on the front row, it's an incredible result for us. I barely did any laps, so I think it could only go better, really. So, yeah, we were massively on the back foot. So far, of course, it's been quite a terrible weekend in that sense. But, yeah, to be on the front row with the difficulties that we had, I think, showed that we stayed calm and just tried to look into the data, you know, to try and understand the car a bit more and try to just be a little bit more competitive. Yeah, it is. I don't expect miracles. I think in Austin, yeah, Ferrari was really, really fast. Of course, maybe that week McLaren was not as strong, but then in the race, I think they were still competitive. So from my side, yeah, I don't know. I guess we'll find out tomorrow. No, it just depends on your start and then what happens in front of you. I mean, I think I've been in a lot of starting positions around here. And yeah, it's a long run. Anything can happen, but I don't really think about it too much. I think it's always a very fine line around Turn 2. Yeah, you try to, of course, prepare it as well as you can. And yeah, sometimes you're just out, sometimes you're just in. But yeah, for the second run, I was probably a little bit more careful in Turns 2 and 3, so it wasn't as perfect as I would have liked, but at least the lap counted. I think Carlos explained it perfectly.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, very happy and a great couple of laps. You know, a lot of times around Mexico, you always have the feeling like you cannot put a lap together and it's extremely difficult with how much sliding there is. But today, honestly, my two laps of Q3 were pretty much identical, almost perfect. And yeah, I just put two really solid laps in Q3, enough for pole. And yeah, very happy because that's not normally the case around Mexico with how tricky it is. Yes, definitely since Austin we've done, it seems like, especially on my side, a step up also in qualifying, trying to find something extra with the out lap and the tyre preparation. And yeah, it seems like we are going in the right direction. Obviously, looking forward to finish the job tomorrow, but at least the pole position of today, I'll take it, because it shows progress and some really solid laps. For sure, it's our number one priority. First of all, to bring both cars home, but especially if you win the race, those extra seven, eight points that you get when you win are important for the team in the Constructors. So, yeah, I'll be just looking forward to keep that P1 into Turn 1, and from there, hopefully our race pace should be good enough to win it. Thank you very much. Good stat! Yeah, very sweet because, you know, it's not normal to have such two strong laps around Mexico and there's a lot of sliding in the lap, very difficult to put a lap together, and actually my two laps of Q3 were almost both perfect. Yeah, very happy to be on pole and to confirm the good form from Austin. Austin already that last lap of Q3 was coming good. So I had high hopes coming into Mexico and yeah, we've managed to keep it up. No, it's just a Lando thing that he normally likes to do. I think it's from iRacing or something. He likes doing short distance to the line. And I said, well, I lose nothing by, maybe if it's faster, maybe cutting a bit the distance. Maybe it gives me a thousand or two thousandths of a second that I'm going to make sure this time I don't leave them out there. And yeah, I remember from our McLaren days he used to do it a lot and I was a bit puzzled. But yeah, tyre preparation has been a hot topic in Ferrari the last few races because we feel like in the race we're always very strong, but we seem to lack something come qualifying. Yeah, this year's car is very good on tyres, but I think that sometimes it means that in quali you cannot maybe extract the maximum out of the tyres in the first timed lap on the Soft tyres. And yeah, I put a bit of focus on that during the break, the three-week break. came into Austin and Mexico with a couple of things that seemed to pay off. Yeah, relatively confident because I know my race pace should be good tomorrow. Probably the biggest difficult thing will be the run down into Turn 1 and starting on pole with a slipstream, no? But I think you can still defend, you can still make it stick into Turn 1 starting on pole and that will be my target tomorrow. Not much, really. I just need to make sure I do a good 0-100, which is the most important thing when you start on pole, just make sure you do a good jump. And from there obviously do the best I can to defend. I have two guys behind fighting for quite important things tomorrow and the run down into Turn 1 should be interesting. I have obviously less to lose in that sense and I'll make sure that I try and keep P1. I think it was a positive, productive meeting. I think a lot of drivers opened up about how they felt about each situation and what we think is the best way forward. Yeah. how you interpret the rules and those driving guidelines that the Stewards are going to apply penalties with, they're still the same coming into this weekend and probably I think they will be applied in a similar manner. But, yeah, I think moving forward it was a productive meeting and I think in Qatar we will have some solutions that hopefully will offer, I think, better understanding for the driver and better racing in general. Yeah, hopefully it should be better. Very sweet. Given how good the car is, how well I'm driving recently, you know, it's obviously optimistic going into the last five races. At the same time, bittersweet because it gives me a feeling Ferrari might be in the fight for the World Championship next year and I will not be there to use it. And I feel like I've been quite a big part of this team during the last four years trying to prepare the team to fight for that championship next year, you know, and the fact that I'm driving well, being fast with the car and I'm living in five races is definitely leaves me a bit… I don't know how to say it, but not with a very good feeling. But it's what it is. I'm going to try and, as I've said, win more races, stand on the podium for as long as I can during these five races and enjoy that. And then we will think about next year. No, honestly, the start I will just do everything I can to stay in P1 because also around Mexico that's really important for the cooling of the car, for the tyres and everything. So I'll do everything I can. But I say my focus is on the 0 to 100 and on the launch. Then everything else happening from then onwards… It depends, also, on how good my rivals start and all the instinctive decisions that we all take in the start. I'll trust my instincts and obviously with the intention of getting out of that corner P1 for sure. T There were two really good laps and the fact that the first lap was so good and so much clearer of the field allowed me to take even further risks in Q3. I added a bit of front wing just because I had nothing to lose and see if by adding a bit more front end to the car I would go even quicker. But yeah, that's what happens when the first lap is so good. Also, the first lap of Q3, I didn't take many risks with the Turn 2 kerb, trying to stay away from track limits. While in the second lap, I knew that the first might be enough for pole, and I just tried to maximise the track limits there. And it gave me, for free, a tenth that I kept for the rest of the lap. So yeah, two very good laps, especially when you see the two or three guys I have behind me, with Lando, Max, and Charles, obviously, to be two, three tenths clear must be some very solid laps. I think the upgrades are helping for sure. I think the circuit characteristic is a very important factor. I don't expect to be on pole in Qatar, just given how weak we are in high-speed. But in the low-speed, how tight the corners are, and how good we are in kerbing around Mexico, I said that we had a good chance and it's been like that. And also I try honestly to be as realistic and as honest as possible with you guys when I talk about our prospects to each race. I don't know, I left Singapore with a really strange feeling with the mistake I did in qualifying, with how tricky it was for us to switch on the tyres, how one session we could be P1, the next session we were one second off Lando, and I was like, I need to find something, because it cannot be that from one session to another we have a six, eight tenths swing on tyre performance over one lap. I worked during the three weeks to see how can we make it a bit better in quali and then we can fight in the race with a good race pace that the car has.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"It's pretty impressive. You always forget when you are on the other side of the world with so many races, you really forget the amount of support you have in your own country. And yeah, it's amazing. It's a great opportunity. It's a great experience every single Grand Prix. You know, it's crazy to think that this is the ninth Grand Prix that we've had. I was just joking with some of my sponsors yesterday, every year we used to do a football game for the for the lead up to the grand prix and now nobody can play because everyone has issues with the knees, with the back, you know, so everyone is aging so much! It's just great you know to look back at it and obviously this year again I think this Mexican Grand Prix, to me, I think it's the best in the world by quite a chunk. Austin wasn't a good weekend for us. We did lack some of the upgrades. We basically thought that the new floor wasn't as big as It turned out to be in the end with Max. We had a bit of that, and we just didn't get a good weekend. It wasn't a good weekend where I built a lot of confidence. But Mexico is different. It's a different game. It's a different track. So, yeah, let's see. We got some changes here. So let's see. Hopefully we can be in the mix for the win. Yeah, definitely. I think we've had good races in the past. We've always been competitive. Every year I've been here with Red Bull, we've always fought for the win, for the podium. So, yeah, I really hope that we can be at that level this weekend. Thank you. Yeah, it's been incredible. I think already since first year was very big, the event, the people were really enthusiastic. And I think it won the award for the best Grand Prix for like four or five years in a row. And I think now it's just a lot better. So yeah, I think it's still the best Grand Prix in the calendar. Well, I think the numbers and the facts will remain internal with the team, with the engineers. We know what was the delta. And having Ferrari there, I think doesn't change anything. You know, I think we want to win the Constructors’ finishing second or third. The end is no difference, you know, so we really want to win it. for that. We need to have both cars with the With the best possible performance and best possible package as well. I agree with what Nico just said, I think Austin is really the worst for it in terms of track layout. Turn 1, Turn 12, even Turn 11 can be quite difficult in that regard. So yeah, it can go in your favor or against you. And I think here, for example, it won't be an issue. Well, when you look at it, I arrived into Turn 1 and I was leading. I was in front. I obviously took a risk that it didn't work out. I've been on the podium for the last two years in a row, so I really wanted to go for the win. I had the opportunity and I went for it. I think in hindsight, the easiest thing was having just to back up. and finish on the podium again. But I really wanted to go for the win. I gave it all. And I think as a racing driver, you have no regrets when you give it all. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And as long as I give it all this weekend again and I don't leave anything on the table, I'll go home happy regardless of the result. So that's my main target, to give everything to these people because the amount of support I get here, it's pretty insane. Well, I think it's great, you know, for the fans. In the past, we had Esteban [Gutierrez] that was there also. We had two Mexican drivers at the time. And it's really hard for a country to have one Formula 1 driver. So to have two racing at the same time, it was just a unique moment. So it's great for the crowd. And I hope Pato can get an opportunity soon in a team to be a racing driver in Formula 1. Yeah, definitely. I know I've had a terrible season, a very difficult one. It started really well, but it's been really, really difficult. And for me, you know, if I get a strong result, it can definitely change my season massively in terms of feeling, personal feelings. So I'm really up for it. And, yeah, I think that moment will stay with me forever, you know, having my son up there with me on the podium, watching me. It's something that I hope he remembers forever. If not, I'll have the picture at least to show him when he's older, you know. And those moments, I think, is the ones that really matter to me. And I hope I can repeat that one this weekend. I think momentum in Formula 1 is very important, when you just put the car on track and you know that everything is working and you are so further ahead of the people that put the car on track and have a lot of problems. I think it's the same for everyone, but I also know how this sport works and it's all about your last race. So if I get a good one here… I got a good one in Baku, but it didn't work out. If I get a good one here, then my season can definitely take a U-turn. The most important is that we are able to feel comfortable with the car, which at the moment we are just not able to unlock the full potential. of the car and we come to the weekends trying a lot of things different things every weekend and so that so it makes just the the whole Grand Prix a lot more difficult. Well, I feel that I'm in the same boat as the team. We're working towards solving it. We found a big issue in Monza. So after Monza, we thought we were finding directions. We're heading in the right direction. I think this is Formula 1. Sometimes the results are not coming, and you just have to make sure you keep your head down, you focus on the stuff that you can control, and the rest is something that you cannot get bothered with.",Mexico City,thursday,Red Bull
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah, it's been very positive. Scored points twice, and with both cars in the Sprint. So, yeah, I think, you know, we feel very happy coming out of there. Also, you know, taking P6, obviously, at the moment in the championship. So we want to obviously hang on to that, repeat it as often as we can and take that momentum into this week and to next week and just keep building on that. Yeah, we've taken... I think all throughout the year, we've, you know, continuously progressed. Very different to last year, where upgrades didn't really come and often didn't work. This year they do something to the car and they do enhance the performance. We've started early in the year around China with some upgrades, Miami. Silverstone was obviously a big one. That was a big step forward and last weekend again it felt quite positive. But then I think there's more things to learn and hopefully to explore. It's been very positive, especially when you consider and remember how we finished at the end of last year and races on Sundays, so a hell of a turnaround for us. Like I said, it's great fun, everyone in the team obviously enjoying it, and we want to keep that rolling. Yeah, I think it's a good, positive atmosphere. Obviously, everyone is very upbeat and a lot of positive things happened in the past few months. And I think that's very good. But then weekend in, weekend out, you have to do a good job. You have to earn it. You have to make no mistakes because it doesn't take much to come out on the wrong side in midfield. If you have a little mistake here or there, you could be easily P15, 16 instead of P10. We have to convert it again. I think the performance of the package is decent, but it's down to us now on the operations side to keep performing. Very confident. I think it's also a bit track dependent and obviously Austin is, you know, particularly Turn 12 is always, every year it's one of the hot spots where it happens easily and a lot. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, sometimes it works for you, sometimes it doesn't. It's part of racing and we'll see going forward what we come up with. I think not necessarily. You know, most of my career I spent in the midfield, you know, and I know the laws inside and out there. And it just comes down to for them to develop, to put a better package on the road, which is what Haas managed to do over the winter. That will obviously be the target and the ambition for Sauber as well, to transform it over the winter. And then that's obviously musing on the future, but I'll see, you know, what the car and the package is like once we start working there next year. Last corner in Austria, put some deterrent… Of course, if you put a natural deterrent there, it will change the dynamic of the corner. In street circuits, if there's a wall, it changes things. And yeah, I mean, in most sports there are these grey areas. And like I said earlier, I think it's track dependent. And Austin is always one that brings out that grey area quite a lot. So yeah, maybe that's one thing, one area we can look into to try and help, particularly that corner, I think Turns 12, 15. But yeah, I didn't, I obviously saw the replay, but I didn't spend a great deal looking at, you know, everybody else's race and analyze the situation I was celebrating our weekend.",Mexico City,thursday,Haas
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, I mean, best qualifying of the year. So I would say definitely some good positives to take away from the weekend. You know, looking back at a couple of months ago, we started in Bahrain on the last row. Still, we kept focusing on developing the package we have and, you know, eventually got to P7 last week in quali. So very pleased to see some good evolution with the car. The other side on Sunday, it wasn't a good race, not well executed. Unfortunately, we lost quite a bit of time with the pit stop, struggled a lot with the Hard tyre and lost the good start we had. So quite gutted not to convert this good quali into points, but at least there is definitely some hopes. you know encouraging signs that we we're going to be able to fight slightly further up the top for the remaining races. Well, to be fair, all around the track, like just in terms of overall potential, just can carry a bit more speed, a tiny bit better on braking. It's just to have a bit more grip available. So still I’d say the balance, got a few things to improve there and there that we got to work on. But like all the cars, you know, down the pit lane, no one's going to get that perfect balance, but in terms of overall potential, you know, I was pleased to see, Q1, Q2, Q3, we were able to put laps good enough always for the top 10 and that was definitely encouraging. It's not going to be easy. I think at the minute, looking at the Haas, the top four is out of reach, but after that, actually a very tight battle between the Haas, AlphaTauris (sic), we saw the Williams performing very well at the moment, and I still believe we're probably lacking a tiny bit to be consistently there, but we're going to have our chances. It's five more races. I'm sure there are going to be one or two tracks where we'll be able to be in that mix. For the guys, personally, it's important for me to get a few more points before the end of the year. Yeah, very exciting news. Just became a padel team owner this morning, entering the eighth team in the Hexagon Cup. So it's a new competition that started last year in Madrid. There are big names in there, Leo Messi, you know, Andy Murray, Rafa Nadal, they’ve all got their own team and many others. And it's going to be exciting to have my own team competing against these guys. So it's going to be end of January next year. So for whoever is available on that weekend, they're more than welcome to come and watch the event. I'm not going to play myself. These guys are professional and it's quite a fun format where you've got professional players with also like amateurs and youngsters. So you get eight players in total and it's quite a fun tournament. But yeah, I'll try to be there to support my team. I haven't seen him yet, but why not? Try to get his focus away from F1 a bit. New guidelines You say? After Austin? No. Ah, you mean the one previously to Austin. I think Austin highlighted that there is definitely something that's got to be changed. I think there is the rule as it's written and there is more the common sense on how you want to approach racing. I think there is this gray area at the moment which allow us drivers to benefit from the regulation in a kind of unfair way of approaching racing. And I think this is something which I guess we all agree and which will be worked on with the FIA on how to improve things because there have been a couple of incidents which got us on a split or with mixed feelings on the decision that came out of it. I think we all need some clarity and a bit better written rules to improve the racing for the future. Well, I was impacted by it in the race, so I did look at the replay and yeah, I mean, the way I see it is I think there's one rule which needs to be changed. It’s that front axle at the apex, whoever has got their front axle first at the apex has got the priority, but then how much of a car control you got at that point? because otherwise ultimately you're just going to end up having situations where you can just divebomb, not committing to the corner, just to make sure you’ve got your front axle at the apex. even if you can't make the corner that's going to be your corner. But then you might create other problems that you end up having all cars off the racetrack. And whoever gets the priority doesn't get penalised, et cetera. So I just think that specific rule, the way it's written, I get it. That's the way it is. And at the moment, we've got to respect it. Moving forward, this needs a change to allow us to have more fairness in the way we fight. So I think there is this really clear point in the regulation that needs updating. I would organise a tournament for that. Race drivers, we all like to claim we are the best at everything. You're never going to get a fair answer. I can't answer that.",Mexico City,thursday,Alpine
Zhou Guanyu,"You know, firstly, I think, excited, of course, to try the new package. I think Austin, in general, we were still trying to extract everything we could. I think it wasn't easy, just seeing how difficult, let's say, the start of the weekend for us, but also with the short term of just FP1, then obviously not getting enough track time to try certain things, trying to extract them. So I think it's working like we expected in terms of numbers. But I did definitely expect to be a little bit more ahead than the pace was. But one thing I think was good is that in qualifying, it was, I think, both of us under two tenths to Q2, which is the closest we've ever been the last four five races. In a way it shows how much struggle we've been in but one another side I think it shows we have managed to close the gap, which is something nice to do. Unfortunately my race, definitely not going to go too much into detail on that, with a mistake in Turn 1 and that cost quite a bit. But even then I think points weren't possible that weekend. But I was just trying to give it always what I had. So this weekend is going to be completely different, which will be nice and jump in the car after let's say P1, from P2 onwards, trying to figure out, you know, what we go forward and, you know, what set-up we make, adjustments. I mean I think this track layout in general for us it's on the table to do well but yeah I wouldn't really set let's say the benchmark high for what's happening this year just because we've been struggling quite a bit in places and some tracks even we're struggling more than the previous years which is quite difficult to go through that. but In another way, I think last year was definitely one of the stronger races in terms of purely on Saturday performance. The car was really good. And also, let's say, in general, the track is not so bumpy, like we've been struggling with a lot of stiffness of our car over the bumps and kerbs. So, yeah, hopefully we can have a car on the ground straight away that is working like we expected and we’re working on that. But, yeah, there's plenty, let's say, of catch-up to do as a team for us to try to back in the fight for points. Yeah, firstly, I think it's quite clear that we went through a lot more conversation than we did at the last few race weekends, and we knew that nothing has been declared. Also, nothing has been signed for the second seat and we are still in contention for that, myself and then together, I think, Valtteri, it’s quite clear. And yeah, nothing has been done. So we're just giving all every weekend showing what we can do to Mattia, and then of course end of the day is up to him and the Audi people to make a decision. But on the other side, you know, you are focused on the season, but you're also thinking, you know, what to do after in case you don't have a seat. Of course, we have a few options that is looking not too bad as well. But firstly, the race drive remains the priority for now to be focused on. For sure not. I mean, it's been real tough, because I still remember... because it just felt a lot better the first few races of the season. Of course, we struggled with other things in the pit, but when the car was actually performed quite competitively together with the people around the midfield battle, you really felt you can show what you are gaining or what you learned, experience over the course of two and a half years, that you are getting better experience, better knowledge with everything, and also get more understanding about what you need to go quicker. But then, in that period right now, it's quite difficult, of course, to accept as a driver. But in the same time, I think you do the best you can, you kind of, you know, you're out in Q1 or you are just struggling to get through that. And sometimes you're missing, like, half... Sometimes you're missing like half a second to the cut-off, which sometimes is difficult to explain exactly, purely on driving. So it's a tough season, but you only got what you have, so I'm still trying to give everything I've got for the remaining races. And like I said, I care about my future, I care about wanting to stay here as long as I could, so I'm fighting for that, and the opportunity is still there, so I'm just trying to head down. Yeah, I mean, I think Charles pretty much covered everything. I think the hardest part, you know, in terms of what's happening on track, especially what I see in Austin, we always focus the rules saying you have to be, like, say the guy's making a move on the outside, have to be ahead in the apex, but then the guy inside, of course, he's going to release the brake, trying to make sure that doesn't happen. But then if he can't stop in the white line, you know, it's really complicated. And to make a rule clear because at the moment I feel, yeah, situation by situation, sometimes we're still lacking a bit of consistency, but it's tough when you have a track like that, very much a wide run-off area with various, you know, people can be just making different approach and driving lines as well. So we already, you know, discussed after the weekend, I think there will be further talks together with the drivers also with the FIA to be more clear on that. Yeah, I think, you know, the biggest thing I felt was that probably from the first year I was driving here, from FP1 to qualifying, the grip, actually you're gaining a little bit, but compared to most of the tracks, for example, you actually doesn't really feel the track evolution that extreme. And then, like Charles mentioned, firstly, with the cooling in the race, it’s a big issue for the engine, for the gearbox, for the brakes, that's very easy to be overheating. And then on the other side, with the massive straight, DRS detection, you're actually not getting that much tow effect and slipstream like you expected at normal tracks. So that's probably the biggest difference. And yeah, the rest is all quite similar, to be honest.",Mexico City,thursday,Sauber
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, it's very difficult to predict this season race by race. Last weekend went extremely well for us. We were particularly strong in races and in race pace. In qualifying, we struggled a little bit more. However, on paper, Mexico should be quite a good track for us. But that doesn't mean we'll reproduce the kind of performance we've done in Austin, we just need to focus on ourselves, focus obviously on FP2 for me, I won't be doing FP1, Ollie will be in the car for FP1, and yeah, just try and maximise the result this weekend, and then we'll see where it ends up, but it's obviously a very important part of the season, only five races to go, and there's the Constructors’ title, that is still possible, so we'll give absolutely everything in order to try and take that one. We've been very consistent and I think we've been maximising our own performance, which is the most important thing. I don't think we've been necessarily the fastest out of those last few races. However, we were the most consistent and we've maximised most points against our competitors. We had the best car in Austin, though, which is a good thing, because especially coming to the last five races, that's what we needed, and it's the best possible way to start this triple header. But before that, I don't think we had the strongest car, but we were doing the best job as a team in order to bring the maximum points home. So, yeah, that's our goal until the end of the season, and I hope it will pay off at the end. I mean, there's always been a very good vibe in Ferrari. There's a very good vibe in Mexico, especially. And yesterday was a cool team dinner that we did all together. And obviously, after the last weekend, it's nice to regroup. Because on Sunday night, we did a small thing, but nothing for too long because we're all flying the day after and we obviously on a triple header. you've got to keep the energy for the on-track action. so but it was good to regroup yesterday and there's a lot of motivation within the team. we have done some steps forward in the last few races and we know that the Constructors’ is possible. so we've got to keep the focus at 100 in the next few races and hopefully come back to McLaren in the Constructors’. I absolutely loved it. It was a very, very special experience. First of all, I'm very lucky to have been given the chance by Canal+ to actually do that, and not only to go into it, but to be able to pilot it. Obviously, we were two in the plane, so it's not like I was on my own. I wouldn't be able to fly it even though I'm closer and closer to get my plane license, but it's another beast. However, to be able to control it in a safe fly zone or whatever you call it, it was very, very special. I mean, the pilot actually let me go to the limit of the plane, which at first, the first day, I could not at all get close to because I was feeling dizzy and not super well. However, the second day we called go closer to it. And it's just an incredible feeling. And to be able to compare it to what I do on a daily basis or nearly in Formula 1 was a very special experience. So it was really cool. No, it's very different because in a fighter jet, you don't really have references around you that are super close. You're obviously quite high, so the feeling of speed is not really there until you actually go to the limit of the plane and feel the G, and there you see, OK, that's crazy! Whereas in Formula 1, with the walls super close, you really have the sensation of speed straight away. But, yeah, both are extremely unique in their own way. I think my main weakness when I got to Ferrari was being very impatient and sometimes it still bites me. I feel like I found the right balance because I cannot either be happy to be a tenth off and I will always do absolutely everything in order to get that tenth, even if that means that sometimes I go over the limit and crash. But this is probably where I've learned the most, it’s to try and find that balance. Yes, sometimes it will happen that I'll go over the limits, but I know that over the course of the season it pays more often to have that approach than to just be happy being off for a weekend. But as I said, yeah, it's just trying to find that right balance and at the end of the season having the most possible points. And I think that this year that approach was the right one. I mean, Max has always been on the limit of regulations, but that's what makes racing Max so exciting. And that's also why I really like having those fights with him, is that you know that he will never let any room to you, and it will be always at the limit of the regulations. And that's what makes those fights very exciting. Having said that, I feel like there are a few things maybe in Austin that I have seen that we maybe have to discuss with the FIA because I feel like the penalties were sometimes a little bit too harsh and we've got to make sure that we are all aligned, the FIA and us drivers, in order to make sure that it's clear what we can do and what we cannot do when I'm saying that it's more about I think Oscar overtake on the Saturday which for me didn't really deserve a penalty. But this is an ongoing process that we always try to optimise with the FIA and it's a discussion that we'll have I'm sure during this briefing. but to come back with Max it's always at the limit of the regulations. Sometimes it goes a little bit over, but yeah, that's what makes Formula 1 exciting. Those fights makes it exciting. I mean, it was a very, very special moment for me. In Monaco, to be able to win my home race, it was a very special moment, and I'm sure it's a very special moment for every driver that managed to achieve that. However, as a driver, as much as I like Mexico and I really like Checo as well, you're always looking at yourself. And this weekend coming here, I'm super motivated to win again. So it's a very, very special feeling. And I hope for Checo that one day he will manage to do so. But I will do absolutely everything in order for it to not happen because I want to win as many races as possible. It's a very, very complex subject, to be completely honest. I don't have the right answer here. I think common sense needs to be applied in certain situations. When a driver do that multiple times in the same way, at one point… Yeah, we've got to still create overtaking opportunities. And what I've seen in Austin maybe is a little bit extreme. So we've got to look into it. To give one only answer on that subject is difficult because, as I've always said, the rule book is done for a thing. However, there will never be enough rules for every specific situation there on track. And sometimes you just got to have someone that has done that since many, many years, look at the situation and be honest and deal with it, with the specific situation you have in front of your eyes, There will never be one rule that will define exactly the way we shall race, I think. On these kind of things we are and we are more and more involved. So during the Drivers’ Briefing with the FIA we try and always come up with suggestions and they're always open to them for the racing side, so this is good. Well, that makes obviously a big difference for the downforce and for the cooling. So in terms of downforce, you have a lot less downforce compared to a normal track at sea level altitude, which means that you slide a lot more. And then for the cooling, it's a lot more difficult to actually cool the brakes, the engine. It's very difficult. And for us as well, the heart rate goes a little bit higher compared to other races, but it's not the most tiring and physical racetrack on that side. It's not that much of a problem. However, for the car, it's a very tough race. race for the car most especially for the cooling. So this will be a obviously the main topic for this weekend. And then the very low grip but that is I will say similar to maybe a track like Monza. However, we are driving with probably the maximum downforce that we can put on the car but that results in having the same grip as on a track like Monza where we run minimum downforce. So it's a bit strange, as a driver, the first time you drive here because it's not something that you expect to feel that much. However, it's cool. It makes it a little bit different and it's different challenges and as a team you've got to adapt quickly. Obviously, we are getting better and better. I think last year was a very difficult year. Two years ago, we were in a better place in terms of balance. But now we are getting back to this kind of balance. But the balance doesn't mean much. I mean, you can have a very competitive car and a very difficult car to drive. And at the end, what matters is the lap time. It's not how good I feel in the car. Sometimes the two goes together, sometimes they don't. Sometimes a car feels very, very difficult to drive. However, if it feels better than others and that you are faster, then it's good enough. The balance is so much better than a year ago. I think we've been struggling in 2023 with the balance of the car. We've done quite a lot of work on that, and it definitely feels like a big step forward compared to last year. But we are slowly going in the right direction and trying to keep improving, obviously. Yes, I think I've learned to deal with it. Because when you drive for a team like Ferrari, I've always said that I think one of the best things of a team like Ferrari is the passion. And people at the factory won't count the extra hours they've got to put in. However, sometimes this exact same passion can be difficult to manage, because passion means also emotions, and it means that in good times you go super high with the emotions, but in the difficult times you take it a lot more, it's a lot more difficult to deal with it. However, now it's since 2019, I'm with the team, and we've been working a lot on that, and I think we are much more prepared to face those kind of ups and downs. And I don't think we are as influenced by the outside noise around the team than we were maybe two, three, four years ago. So on that, I don't think that it has any influence. And actually, we don't really realize that inside the team. We are just motivated and happy about the actual situation because we are in a good place and we are working in the right direction, but we don't really pay attention to what's being said outside.",Mexico City,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, for me, of course, it was quite a difficult race. I never really had the pace to attack. So a bit different compared to yesterday. Yeah, just understeering a lot, struggling under braking. So that made the defending quite difficult because every time if someone wanted to go for a move, I couldn't really brake that late. But yeah, it was a tough battle. I tried everything I could, of course, to keep him behind. And of course, at the end, to be on the podium is still, I think, for us, a great result. Yeah, you know, I have my opinion, but I don't need to say it here. I let the Stewards do their thing, and for us, it was, again, a race that we learned a lot, and we'll just analyse that. I think today wasn't the best race for us compared to yesterday, for example. Just struggling for balance, for grip. Couldn't really brake, rotate the car. So yeah, quite quickly onwards, I realised that we're not going to win the race. But just tried to do my own race. I think we did the best strategy we could as a team. And then it was just surviving to the end. And then, of course, Lando arrived. We had some really good battles, honestly. It was really a lot of fun. But yeah, overall, it was still quite a tough race for me. No clue. I didn't ask. I just drove. Yeah, I didn't ask yet, so I don't know. There was a gap on the inside, so I went for it. That corner is very wide, so it gives you a lot of opportunity of going very wide or try to go really tight. I chose for that option, and I still came out second! Started second, came out second out of Turn 1. This time, of course, it was Charles in front. I think it worked out quite well for me because Charles was anyway faster, so he just pulled away. From there, I just tried to do my own race. I just tried to do the best I could, to be honest. My balance wasn't great. I was just not really... I was not able to attack the corners. So, yeah, he was putting a lot of pressure. But around here, it's quite a cool track to defend. There are a lot of possibilities. So, yeah, it makes it good for racing. Yeah, I think it's quite clear: you can't overtake outside of the white line. I mean, I got done for it also here in, I think, 2017 or whatever it was. So I lost my podium like that. So I just remained calm, tried to do the best I could after that to bring the car to the end because it was not easy with the tyres and the situation that I was in. But yeah, overall, I still really enjoyed that battle that we had. I mean, it might help, but we have to deal with bikes as well that race here. They don't like the gravel, so then you have to remove it again. Track days, people spinning off, of course, on track days. You have amateur drivers, professional drivers. It does cost a lot of money when you have to do that, and not every track can do that throughout the year. Yes, it would work, but on the other hand, I'm not sure how sustainable that is for the season. That is definitely the positive. I did hope for a little bit more performance today, so that's what we have to analyse, why today we were just not that good. I think everyone was a little bit better or at least the same as yesterday, and it felt like we were definitely worse. So I need to understand why that was, because I don't know at the moment. No, I don't. I mean, they complain about a lot lately anyway, but it's very clear in the rules. Outside the white line, you cannot pass. I've been done for it as well in the past. I agree. Yeah, I trust he said something very good. It's just high speed. You don't want it to be super bumpy. It's dangerous.",United States,post-race,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, for sure. I mean, obviously, first of all, congratulations to the whole team, to Charles, for an amazing result, a result that puts us exactly where we want to be in the fight for the Constructors’ now. So extremely happy for everyone in Ferrari right now. At the same time, obviously, I knew a lot of the race was going to be decided at the start. I knew Lando and Max were going to go hard at it into Turn 1, and unfortunately, I got the worst of it, and I couldn't get that lead. and even though the pace from there on was really good and I was all weekend really fast, track position is key and I had to settle for P2, which anyway was a good race. Tyre management? Yeah, it's definitely the strength of the car this year. How long we can go on stints and how little deg we have is something that I really enjoy and something that has made me enjoy racing a lot more this year than what I did last year. Last year, we spent all of the races defending, losing position. This year, it looks like we just can go on attack mode, don't think too much about tyres, and just push and overtake, which is fun, and I’m enjoying it a lot, and I hope it stays like that until the end of the year. Yeah, very, very happy. And now we are still targeting the title. It's a long way to go, but it's a good start to this triple header. Well, first of all, congrats to the whole team. Congrats to Charles for a great win. And yeah, I think everyone needs to be very happy and very proud of this weekend and yeah, of how we've recovered from a tricky middle part of the season to suddenly put ourselves in a position to dominate the race like we did today and to be clearly the fastest car on track come race day. I'm very happy to see this and I hope it repeats itself from here until the end of the year because it would be really nice to get another win before the end of the season. Yeah, it wasn't the easiest of starts. First, well, getting a bit blocked with the Max and Lando going at it for the championship into Turn 1. Then I was attacking Max, in his DRS, trying to put as much pressure as possible. And then for a lap, I had some sort of issue that meant that I had very little power at the exit of the corners. That made me lose a couple of seconds, and most importantly, the DRS with Max. And then you are in that 1.5, two-second, three-second gap, that is the worst for tyres and car balance, which meant I just had to settle until the pit stop windows. And then, yeah, we managed to get the undercut. Yeah, we boxed really early for that Hard tyre, but from then on, I felt really comfortable, very confident, and we were very quick again. So, yeah, a bit gutted that we were so quick all weekend and we obviously didn't end up getting the win, but at the same time, Charles did a great job and a great start to put himself in the position to win it. Not really. If I'm honest with you, as soon as I saw Charles in P1, then I saw that Max couldn't keep up with Charles. So probably by the time… I knew that if I couldn't pass Max in the first three laps, it was going to be game over because then Charles and I were always very close in pace. Maybe there's one race or two where he's one or two tenths quicker in race day, another race where I'm maybe a bit quicker. But yeah, it just means that track position around any Formula 1 track is key. And after that start, and especially having a car in between us and not being able to pass Max within the first five laps, I knew it was going to be very, very tough. Then, honestly, with a Hard tyre, yes, I caught back some time, but I was just more pushing to see my pace and to see how good I was feeling this weekend because I was enjoying a lot driving the car this weekend and I knew I was quick. Yeah, if I would have to bet, I would say Mexico and Vegas are good tracks based on last year. I'm basing myself a bit on last year. This year everything seems a bit different. But yeah, and then I think Qatar is going to be a bit our bogey track, if I would have to bet again my money and then Abu Dhabi I'm not sure. I'm not sure what we can achieve in Abu Dhabi, but let's see. I just hope this pace shows itself again before the end of the season and gives me another chance of going at it. Yeah, I haven't analysed it either. I think some things are. Others are still a bit blurry to me, let's put it like that. I think there was an example yesterday with Oscar's overtake. That for me was completely fine and very similar to anything that we've done between each other on the sprint. And I felt like the penalty on Oscar yesterday was really, really harsh and didn't go along with some guidelines that I thought were the way they were. So yeah, that penalty surprised me yesterday. About today, I have no clue because I haven't seen, I haven't gone five seconds by five seconds penalty to see. So let's see. Yeah, I think full credit for Ravin and all the strategy team for the progress that's been made in Ferrari over the last couple of years. I think it's been important to see progress in that side. And there's been a lot of work being done behind the scenes. And obviously, Ravin has played a fundamental role in that work. Like I've said many times, having a good car on race day always helps to make the strategy work. And I feel like this year, compared to last year, we have a very strong car on race day. The best example is today. A car that allows you to be the first one to box and still extend the Hard tyre and still be quick on the Hard tyre and not and not be because of being the first one to box, then degrading more than the others. That is something that I've struggled in the past, especially last year, a lot with that. And yeah, Singapore, I remember boxing in lap 14 of a 70-lap race or a 60-lap race and still making it to the end. With any other car or with any other year that we've had, were degradation and the car was weaker in the race, this wouldn't be possible. So making bold strategy moves on race day wouldn't be as easy and you would look more crazy by doing them. And this year, having a car that degrades less the tyres and makes you more competitive on race day also allows you more flexibility and better opportunities to play with the strategy. Yeah, much better in general. I think bumps are always going to be in Austin. And it's part of the track character, which drivers accept. And I think it makes the track a bit different compared to others. But there are certain bumps that will need to get work done every year, like the one in 3, 4, and 5. And sometimes I think it's Turn 19 and breaking into Turn 12 sometimes can get quite bumpy. But if the circuit keeps working at it, just to make sure they don't go crazy jumpy, then I think we're in a good place. But I don't mind a certain level of bumpiness to a track.",United States,post-race,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, thank you. Very happy. I mean, it hasn't been an easy weekend until now. I've been struggling a little bit with the feeling with the car, but I had the confidence that in the race the feeling was better, and it was the case. So we've seen it yesterday in the Sprint race. We were a bit not scared, but we thought that the others would improve a lot more today, but we still had the upper hand. So really happy with today. 1-2 for the team. We couldn't have dreamed for better. Well, it was a pretty good Turn 1. That's exactly what I wanted to do and we've had a really good launch. I knew that it was going to be very tight into Turn 1. Yesterday I was a little bit the victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time and today I gained from it and that obviously helped quite a lot our first stint because we had mega pace, and then in the second stint, it was all about managing behind. But we did a great job. I mean, the pace of the car today and this weekend overall was really, really good in the race. And that's mostly thanks to the engineers. They've been working like crazy in the last few months to bring the upgrades that we've had in Singapore and in the last few races, and it seems to be paying off. So, yeah, the whole team is working super well. Pit stops were really good. Everything worked out well, so we're really, really happy. Yeah, it's been 18 years, would you believe, since Ferrari have had a 1-2 here in the US. So you must be very proud of the whole team? It feels really good as every victory feels special for its own reason and obviously from the start I felt really good with the car. I was quite confident from yesterday because even though there were quite a lot of fights yesterday the car felt great and we knew that we had a good race pace. We were a little bit more sceptical about qualifying but P4 was. It was good. I mean, we were in that fall of P1. And then after that start, when I got out of Turn 1 into first, I knew that it was all about trying to use the pace of the car that we had yesterday and trying to take care of those tyres. And the car felt great. So from that moment onwards, it was a bit of a lonely race, but it's a good kind of lonely. And I hope we can reproduce that in the future. I mean, I knew that Max and Lando would be very aggressive towards each other. I mean, they are fighting for the championship. I got a good start. I saw that Max was going towards the inside as well as Lando and I was like, ‘I'm just going to prepare the exit of the corner’, which was obviously a winning bet. And from that moment onwards, then I could focus on my own race. I wish I could tell you exactly, but it's always difficult because we rely on very small gaps that could make a big difference. So it's very difficult to predict where we will be in the next few races. However, we've said since two or three races in Monza, in Baku, in Singapore, we brought a few upgrades and we were always waiting for Austin because it was going to be the real test for those upgrades. And he seems to be working all good. So that is positive for the future. It doesn't mean that we'll be having every Sunday the way it's been today, but it means that we are working in the right direction and that can only be positive. So I hope we can reproduce these kind of results more often. Quite a few. I think like five, six races ago, we were struggling a little bit with bouncing and that doesn't seem to be the issue anymore. So for sure that went in the right direction again. I mean, we've got to target winning the Constructors’ title. It's an optimistic goal, but that's what we are here for. So, yeah, we'll do the math at the end of the season. Until then, I think the best thing we can do is to focus on ourselves, on our own performance, just like we did this weekend. It's been a really good weekend for the team and for the Constructors’ title. And we'll try and reproduce that as often as possible. And hopefully at the end of the year, when we do the math, we will have won the Constructors’ title. I mean, never say never. Let's say that for the Constrictors, if we do everything perfect until the end of the season, no matter what McLaren does, if we do better than them, I think we can still clinch that title. With the drivers, I see it a bit in a different way. Even if we do everything perfect, I feel like it will require a little bit of luck inside that to try and get that title, and we cannot really rely on luck. So the Drivers’ seems to be quite unlikely, but again, I'll believe in it until it's mathematically impossible. But trickier. I haven't seen any of it. I mean, I just saw the Turn 1, which I think was fine. I mean, it's hard racing, and everybody will try something like that anyway. So nothing to comment there, but I haven't seen any of the rest. Yeah, I agree with Carlos on Oscar's penalty yesterday. I also thought it was a bit too harsh. However, on the rules, I think they are clear. Sometimes the interpretation of the rule can be a little bit different because it will be impossible to have a rule book that takes every single scenario. Every scenario is different, has its particularity, and you've got to analyse it in a different way and interpret the rules in some ways for particular scenarios, which is what the FIA is trying to do best. However, sometimes we disagree, and I think on the one of yesterday, it's something that we'll probably talk of in the next driver briefing. Yeah, we adjusted it. However, at one point, like at lap 15 or 16, we had quite a good gap. So we had the freedom to basically copy whatever Max was doing a lap later, because it's not like he could undercut us. So when you are in this situation, it's quite a lot less stressful because you've just got to copy what the driver behind you does and we had the gap to do so. So then it was more about mirroring what everybody was doing behind more than actually come up with a different strategy at that time. I mean, he's incredible. I have really a lot of trust in Ravin. He's done an excellent job. He's pretty young, too, for a position like that. But he's always super, super calm. And that's really needed. And yeah, he also manages the emotion super well, which maybe in the past was probably one of our weaknesses, speaking of strategy. This has changed a lot with Ravin. And again, he's doing a really, really good job. So I think, yeah, we have a very strong track team at the moment. I mean, apprehension wasn't that big because I could see the gap and the gap was like 10 seconds. So I knew that it was a lot. I knew that Carlos had stopped quite a bit before. Then I learned that Max stopped as well. So for me, there wasn't a lot of reasons for me to go still longer than that, because that will only bring them closer to me when I got out the box. And when you have cold tyres, you don't want to have pressure from behind because you just want to bring the tyres nicely up to temperature. So I do want to find myself in that scenario. So I made it clear to the team. But I think there was at no moment there was any scary thoughts or whatsoever. The gap was plenty. I think there's been a massive step forward in the parts where it's been resurfaced. I still think, though, that the first sector is, apart from Turn 1, that has also been resurfaced, Turn 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 there's still quite a bit of work to be done because it's still extremely bumpy. But apart from that, on the resurfaced parts, it's a lot better.",United States,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, on the first lap in Q3, I lost quite a bit of time there. So, yeah, that's unfortunate. But then, I knew that we had another run, but unfortunately I couldn't finish the lap. Otherwise, I think we had a really good shot. But that's how it goes. We're still on the front row at least. The potential was there, you know, to be first so that's very good. Yeah, it seemed that we were competitive, so we made some minor changes on the car which felt again nice and I hope that that will be also positive for tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, I was a good amount up, but already my first lap in Q3, I missed Turn 19. So I don't know what happened there. I just turned in, probably a bit late, tried to carry a bit more speed. But then, of course, when you're late, you end up really wide. So I had to downshift one more time. So I lost quite a bit of lap time there. That would have already been enough for pole. So I knew that the second lap, you know, there was time to find, for free, but never really got to that corner. So, I mean, that happens, you know, in qualifying, it's not always in your control. I think in general, though, for us, this whole weekend so far has been a lot more positive. We could at least fight for pole and that has been a while. I'm overall happy. I'm not frustrated. I mean, this just happens in qualifying. I mean, I felt quite decent today. We made a few changes on the car and hopefully that will help again for the race. And then hopefully we can try and do the same. Always. I mean, first of all, Singapore has never been a good track for us. All the low-speed corners and the bumps. Our car just doesn't really work on that. So it's a very different track layout. Plus, I think we made the car more stable. So you can attack corners a bit better. And that then also helps, I think, the tyres out a bit. So I think that has been the main improvement.",United States,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I mean, that was the target, to do a step in qualifying compared to yesterday. Yesterday we were P5, today we are P3, so we've done a good step in the right direction. A bit gutted for that last lap because I was three tenths up on my lap, the 32.6, going into Turn 16, with only two corners left. But yeah, easy to say now. Anyway, I think we've done some good progress and we should be in the fight tomorrow if we get a clean start and then with the two guys in front, it should be a fun one. Yeah, I always kept an eye on it because it's something where we've struggled recently in our team to put the tyres in the right window for qualifying. We seem to be always quick in the race, but on qualifying we have some ups and downs and it was my main point of focus during the whole quali. And yeah, it seems like we got it right, especially that last lap before the yellow flag. It seemed like we got them in the right spot because we suddenly found a lot of lap time going into the first two sectors. We'll try and keep it up. Thank you. Yeah, definitely, obviously everyone can say the same, no? Lando deserves to be on pole. Max deserves to be second. I deserve to be third because they did a better job in the first run. But that second lap, I don't know what changed, if it was a lower track temp or what but the car came alive and we were coming with a very fast lap. To be in the ballpark with these two guys, whether to beat them or not, I don't know but, yeah, to be in the ballpark, it's a bit of a shame. But we trust that we can hopefully get them tomorrow in the race pace because, yeah, the sprint was strong and the car even in qualifying took a step compared to yesterday. So, happy with the progress made so far. Relatively. I mean, the race is going to be very long. We're going to top up the fuel. So what we might have seen in the last stint of the race might not be the same as the hundred and something kilos that we put on the car going into Sunday. But one good thing is that we had a good reference from the Sprint. Obviously, these guys haven't stood still and they would have improved that front graining that a lot of people were struggling with in the Sprint. And I think the field is going to be very close tomorrow and it should be an exciting race between a few cars. Well, first of all, I don't agree with your comment. I think it's a Sprint, and I think everyone races hard from the beginning to the end. And regarding the second one, obviously, yes, the main race is a much longer race where I think everyone tends to play a bit longer game with tyre management and everything. And everyone applies all the lessons learned from the Sprint. So everyone knows how to manage the tires better, where to manage them, et cetera, and all. So, yeah, it will be a matter of putting ourselves in a position to try and win again. And again, like everything else, a lot is dictated by the start, by the first lap, and you never know where you're going to end there. So you cannot go into a race with a super clear plan in your head because normally that plan after one corner changes completely because of that start or that Turn 1. So let's see. I'm confident that if we do a good job together, for sure we can fight with these two guys, whether we can beat them starting behind them, that's another thing. It's never easy to overtake in Formula 1 and never easy to, especially the McLaren and Red Bull. For me, that's the biggest positive so far of the weekend, the fact that in a normal track… The last normal track was, let's say, more Zandvoort, Spa, and there we were clear two to four tenths off from a McLaren or a Mercedes. And this weekend, it seems like maybe in quali we don't have the edge to fight for them. Although that last lap in quali, something happened to the car and with my lap that I was really coming on a quick one, even for qualifying. But the reality is that this weekend we're in the fight. And I couldn't say the same of Zandvoort and Spa, the last normal tracks we've been to. So yeah, good positive progress. It is true that last year we were on pole here with Charles. So the car must have some good traits for this, especially those twisty sections in Sector 2 and 3. Sector 1, we're still a clear two tenths, three tenths down to Max and Lando, but we then recover in low speed. So there's some good traits of this car that we have to maximise tomorrow.",United States,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"It was a beautiful lap. I was not going to go much quicker than what I did. You know when you just do a lap, well you know… When you just do a lap and you think, ‘damn, it's going to be tough to beat that’. But I put everything out on the line. And it's what we needed to do. We've been on the back foot pretty much the whole weekend. We've not had the pace of the Ferraris or the Red Bulls. So I had to do something. And today, I did that. So yeah, a cool lap and a nice way to start the race tomorrow. It is. Around here it is, because it's a lot faster. And this is one of the tracks where inside you're like, ‘damn, this is fast’. And it's exciting. And it just gives you a good feeling. It's bumpy and it's fast, especially Sector 1, so it puts a smile on your face. And definitely ending quickest puts a bigger smile on your face too. So a tough day, a tough weekend for us. But we changed quite a bit. I think we reviewed everything we could and we made the improvements we needed to make. Maybe we weren't the quickest car out there today. Carlos said he was going to go quicker. Max was going to go quicker. So I'm lucky and I'll take it. Sure. It's tough. I mean, I'll do my homework. We already made some changes to hopefully improve that direction. But time will tell. So we'll work hard. We've done a good job so far. Box number one ticked. But tomorrow's going to be a tough race. It was the best of probably my career, I think. Yeah, it was just a very nice lap. I kind of set the bar too high because on my second lap, I was like, ‘guys, I don't think I'm going to improve much here’. So yeah, I mean, I got everything out of the car. We changed a good amount from the Sprint race into quali today now and definitely took a step forward. But man, I was still struggling a lot. So I just knew I had to risk a little bit more and give it that little extra. And it just came together perfectly. But it was definitely not a lap I could have repeated. So I'm very happy because I really wasn't expecting to be here today. I mean, it was just a bit everywhere, honestly. But of course, the high speed is a little bit where we struggle a touch compared to the Red Bulls, especially, you know. Max has been extremely quick in the first sector and the high speed. So trying to limit that a little bit more was a good start. And then just the braking. The final sector, you know, from 12 to 16. As soon as one part goes wrong, it can all fall away quite quickly. And again, just hooked everything up, probably the first time all weekend and probably the last. But yeah, it just came together perfectly. So it was a very, very good lap. I'd probably say quite confidently the best of my career. I mean, quite a big one. I don't want to do it again. We'll see. I don't think it was as bad as what it was. I think certain events led to such a thing. I think we improved the car quite a bit. We were definitely not contending anywhere close to pole yesterday. And today we kind of did. I think we're still a bit off, but we're in a good position. I think actually our pace relative to Max over yesterday and today is probably a bit more similar. I probably expected the Ferraris and Mercedes to be a bit quicker today, but maybe they just got a bit more out of the car earlier on in the weekend and we've been able to just take a bigger step forward between the Sprint and now. So maybe we've caught up a bit, but it's going to be a tough race. I mean, Ferrari were very quick in the race today with the degradation. Max is Max. I always said that Max is Max and they're going to be fast. So I'm excited. I think it's going to be a good battle and probably a good one to watch. Yes, I mean, I was just pushing everywhere, but yesterday in quali… I probably did what Max did in his first [run]. As soon as you miss the apex, you have to give up the corner because you're going to go off. It's basically a guarantee. It's a hard one to get right. You have to time it perfectly. Turn in too early, hit the kerb. Too late, you miss it and you're off. But it's a corner, again, where in general we've been a bit down to Red Bull. Red Bull are very quick in these faster corners. And as one of them, I just had to risk that a little bit more. It was close, it was on the edge. But it's what I needed today. Quite simple. I think the gap was 0.03, I think, to Max. And without some of these little bits where maybe some people didn't use all of the track on that kind of thing, today I had to and I needed to, and it got me pole. My performance engineer will be very happy with me. Yeah, it's a very rare thing. He knows I don't like that kind of stuff normally. It's just because I said after, I think, Q2, I was just not confident at all in the car. I was bouncing everywhere. And I just lacked confidence at that point to put a good lap together. And I've been struggling in Turn 1, been struggling in Turn 12. But we were there or thereabouts. It was more just let's get a good lap in and be there. So that's what I did. Whether or not what I did was because of Will's comments, I'd probably say no, otherwise I'll boost his ego too much. But, yeah, it was just that I probably needed it a little bit just because I was struggling a lot with the car and we've been a bit off this weekend and I just… A little kick never hurts sometimes. It's a good question. I don't have an easy answer, honestly, for it. People would probably hate me for saying it, but I don't think… We've definitely had the best car for, for several races and quite a few races this year over the last two, three months, but definitely not every race. Singapore was, I think we can say quite confidently, we were the best. Baku, just the race before that, I think even though Oscar won, I think he won because he drove better than the others. And I think Red Bull and Ferrari were both quicker once again. People might not agree with that. That's our version of events. That's what we think as a team. That's what we believe. So if we just go back two races ago, we were not the quickest car. We were last weekend in Singapore, or last time out in Singapore, and perceptions change because of certain things. When you're in the team and you actually know where you stand, where you are relatively to other teams, I can confidently say these things and say where I believe we are and where we're not. Sometimes I'm wrong, but even like today, I don't think we're... My lap was very good. I could not have gone one and a half tenths quicker or probably gone any quicker than the lap I did today, which shows we're not as fast, but exactly knowing where we're struggling a bit more is tough. There's different reasons. A bit of the bottoming and the ride in the high speed, that's where we struggle comparing to the Red Bulls. And comparing to the Ferraris, their slow speed is incredible. And I think even if we go back to Singapore, where we dominated, Ferrari were very quick the whole weekend until qualifying. They made some mistakes. I think the final stint, Charles was the quickest car on the track on the Hard tyre. So it's just you need to know information before you can make certain comments. And I think it's just been very close and closer than people think, even though we've dominated a few weekends. And this is one where we're just not quite as quick and maybe the others have taken a couple of steps forward and it's a little bit different. I don't have any exact answer. I'm just driving the car. But this is my feeling and kind of our feeling as a team.",United States,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, I mean, it was a good race. Honestly, I'm pretty happy with how things ended up. Yeah, it was a tough one. I thought I could maybe hang on to second, but Carlos did a good job, and my front tyres were completely finished. So there was not a lot I could do, whether I stayed straight or defended or not I'm pretty sure I would have lost the position to Carlos. So disappointing end, but I'm happy with the race results and a good amount of points. No, there's a few races and starts were bad, but otherwise they've been good. And today was a good start again and a good first corner. So, yeah, I did the most I could. I don't think we have the pace on Max or the Ferraris. Therefore, I'm happy to finish third. Yeah, it was a good start, a good Turn 1, which was nice to have, and immediately behind Max. And it was pretty straightforward from that point onwards. George was pushing a lot in the beginning of the race, clearly a bit too much, and paid the price. I don't know, for me, it was a bit like, I didn't think I would ever be able to get Max. We've been struggling a bit all weekend, so my chances of getting Max were tough, but I did the best I could to manage my tyres and things like that. But at the end of the race, the Ferraris were another level comparing to us. So I did my best to try to hold on, but there was pretty much zero chance I would ever hold on to second place today. So happy, I mean, from fourth, happy we moved up. We put up a good fight, but we just don't have the pace this weekend. So, yeah, maybe some changes to make into qualifying and for the race tomorrow. But we're not on the same level as, I think maybe similar to Max, but the Ferraris we are quite a chunk behind. That once the front tyres are gone, you're quite slow. I mean, many things. Like Max said, we didn't get a lot of practice, we didn't get a lot of running in FP1, and it's hard to judge everything all in one go. And with the tarmac being different and bumps being different, it's hard to optimise the setup. So we'll review everything and see what improvements we can make. Okay. I don't know where or... Oh, the one where you have to turn and brake the whole way around. I mean, you brake in the corner, so it makes sense, to be honest. No, I'm very happy we brought updates here, otherwise I'd be even further down the grid. No, the team have done a good job to get the bits here. I think it's clear that everyone... I mean, we've had some great races lately, like Singapore and other places, but everyone thought we were easily and way far ahead of everyone. And clearly we're not. Even if you go back to Baku and things, both Red Bull and Ferrari were quicker than us. I think we're close. But even when I look at the data comparing to yesterday, we're a long way off what Ferrari could achieve, what Mercedes could achieve. So yeah, I think it's going to be tough. It's an opportunity for us to improve into qualifying. But these upgrades have made us go quicker. So yeah, we'd be even further down without them. Yeah, I think no matter what I would have done, I think Carlos was coming past. My tyres were completely finished by the end. So, yeah, one thing, I can just not defend and let him go up the inside and he gets me that way, or I defend and just put too much stress on the tyres. You have to be so delicate with everything and it was just too easy to go over the limit, so I paid the price that way. Actually, I almost think the fact he got me there was potentially a better thing because I could have a good DRS on him and had a bit of a gap to Charles. So yeah, not necessarily a bad thing that he actually got me that early in the lap.",United States,post-sprint,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, and honestly, they were very fun battles. Yeah, a good Sprint. I think if the Sprints are like this, you always enjoy them, that little bit of extra action. Yeah, we had a lot of battles, especially the first five laps, a lot going on. And yeah, towards the end, I was starting to struggle with the tyres, but I saw Lando also struggling and I thought that if I could get into the RS, I would have my chance to finish in P2. And yeah, we made it stick into Turn 1 and yeah, it was a fun one. Yeah, well, the reality is that we didn't manage much the tyres because we were in so many battles the whole time that we couldn't really actually focus on tyre management too much. And even though we did that, our pace was still quite decent, so it's encouraging to see that maybe for tomorrow we have a good chance. I think anyway in qualifying, our car is still not in the best place, but we will try and qualify as far ahead as possible. I really enjoyed it. Obviously this year we have a car that allows us to move forward in the race. Last year it was a bit like Max was saying, looking in the mirrors, in the Sprints, in the races. And this year the car tends to come alive on the race and immediately after lap one I saw we had a good pace and I could keep up with the guys in front and we went racing. It was some exciting battles, first with Charles. I remember at some point thinking, ‘OK, we're having fun even here’, because I was overtaking him on the inside. He was doing the switch back on the inside on the exits, and it was quite fun. Then we got George, and towards the end I thought Lando was going to be tricky to get, but we just made it two laps to the end, and on the last lap I could move into Turn 1. I don't know, but, you know, it's impossible to say. We will see tomorrow. I knew that, obviously, the first few laps I was quite quick and I wanted to get to the front as soon as possible and that was the plan we did, probably the thing that we suffered the most with is obviously being in so much battle offline, online, the tyre degradation or the tyre management wasn't ideal. But even without that tyre management towards the end of the race, we were still pretty competitive, so it gives me hope going into tomorrow. I don't think... Well, I would always rather bring upgrades than not. But at the same time, I think we've already brought them in the few races before this, and now it's all about trying to optimise this until the end of the year. It's a package that we've seen can allow us to fight for some race wins, very track-dependent in our car, but honestly this weekend I'm a bit surprised that we are so competitive. I thought it was more a Monza, Singapore and Baku special that we were relatively competitive, but this is much more of a normal track with long combined corners and that's normally where we tend to struggle. I think in qualifying we will see the two Mercs, potentially Max and Lando, around us or ahead or behind within a tenth. Then in the race it seems like we tend to have good pace and that's where we need to maximise it. It gives me good hope. I think now we need to focus on qualifying. I think qualifying is a very important part of the week and know where our car recently seems to be racing a bit better than qualifying. And now we need to see if we can qualify. I think top three gives you a good chance going into Sunday here as then you can overtake. It's normally a race with a lot of pit stops, with a lot of overtaking. Yeah, I think at least for here, get ourselves into contention on Sunday. You need to be further ahead from where I was today.",United States,post-sprint,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"It was not too bad. Yeah, it feels a bit like old times. Yeah, I'm very happy with today. I think, of course, if you look at the whole race, Ferrari was also very quick. But I think for us, finally, we're racing again. Normally in the race, we're always looking back behind us. But now we could just do our own race. And yeah, we're at good pace. Probably because I don't like it! I don't know. I mean, it's, of course, always a very hectic weekend like this, you know, to get the car in the right window. But luckily, the last few times that we had a Sprint, I think the car was in a good window. So, yeah, there's a bit more pressure on delivering, but luckily it's working out for us. Yeah, I'm happy. Yeah, it's been, of course, quite a few races where it was more like just looking behind, never really being able to attack. And now, finally, the car definitely had just more performance. I could push a bit harder. So, yeah, very, very happy with today. I mean, looking at the whole race, I think Ferrari was also very quick. But for us, this was already much, much better. Well, I mean, back where it was in the beginning of the season is difficult to say because everyone is improving as well. It just feels a bit more together. And I think that is what we have been lacking. I mean, over one lap, you can mask a lot of issues. But then, of course, in the race, you need a balanced car, which was a bit of a struggle for us the last few races. And now, today, it was definitely a lot better. No, it's just, you know, the track with the new tarmac in places and compared to last year, you know, your references are a little bit different. And, of course, with the Sprint format, you don't have a lot of information, so it's like you're getting better throughout the race, I think, as well, understanding what you have to do, and basically that was it. No, I'm just a good person. Yeah, I mean, just trying to follow the track, the car. You drive to what the car allows you to do, right? And that has been our weakness in the last few races, and today it allowed me to go a little bit faster without having to worry with the balance of the car. So I think that just improved in the last sector also. Yeah, it's difficult to say. I mean, I think over the whole race since today, I think Ferrari was very fast. From our side, yeah, we'll look into things to improve. Going into qualifying, but it's a bit difficult to tell at the moment how we would be on full fuel. Not worried. I mean, I looked in the mirror out of Turn 1 and I saw Lando and I said: ‘oh, he had a good start’ and that's how it goes. And then I just focus on my own race. You know, that's the only thing that I can control. I think what has been very important for us in the last few races is to remain calm and just work on the problems. And that's what we have done as a team. Just focus on ourselves. That's the only thing that you can influence and control.",United States,post-sprint,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Comparing, I don't think it's the right word. I've been suffering next to the world number one, that by the way is in incredible form and an incredible moment for Tadej Pogacar, now that he's killing it in cycling. And I had the brilliant idea to go on a recovery ride for him. For me, it was the toughest ride of my life. He was on recovery mode after winning the world champs. And yeah, his recovery ride is still my zone five heart rate, zone four, zone five. So it just shows the difference. I mean, we are athletes in our sport. Obviously what we do is special in terms of reflexes and car handling and skills, but what he does on top of a bike is just incredible. And anyone who's been on a bike before, I cannot imagine how much this guy pushes on a bike. I think the more tracks that we've done since Monza, the more confident we are that the upgrades that we brought to the car start to work pretty much everywhere. But for me, I always said, no, with the last three races, I said, until we don't go to Austin and we try them in a normal track, we will not be able to measure how much we've actually improved in tracks like Zandvoort, Spa, where we last struggled a bit more. So I think this will be the most important test so far for us to see whether all these upgrades that we brought in the past are working in the right direction for more of a normal kind of truck like we see here in Austin. Nothing new here is what we brought in Monza. And I think we brought a small upgrade in the front wing for Singapore. But yeah, more than that it’s confirming whether our better pace in the last three races is coming more from going to three tracks that really suited us, like Monza, Baku, and Singapore. or whether it's also the upgrades having a big effect on whether we were more competitive in those three tracks. And Austin will be able to tell us which one of the two it is. For me it's two separate things. I'm really looking forward to next year and the challenge with Williams. First of all, it's also good to see how much they've improved recently and how that car now can get to the points quite often in the last few races. So there's encouragement, and looking forward to that, obviously. But there's first a job to finish this year with six races left in a car that can potentially allow me to win a race or score a couple more podiums. And I want to maximise this opportunity to see if I can help the team also finish as far ahead as possible in the Constructors' Championship and obviously give myself that big present of a nice podium or a win, which is what I'm looking for and what I'm focusing on with the last six races. I always was of the opinion that it was a not-needed point in the points system of Formula 1, mainly because of how it is achieved. Right now, that point goes to the one that has a free pit stop one lap to the end of the race. So it's not showing who is the fastest guy in the race, and he deserves one point for being the fastest guy. It's a point that goes to the guy that by chance or by luck or by race situation has a free pit stop at some point of the race. It's not always the case. Not always, but in a lot of occasions, most of the times. Yeah, I agree. Pole position is something that, at least in Formula 1, is given a lot of value. Qualifying is something that media people keep a lot of importance to know. And obviously as drivers in qualifying, we like being the fastest because it shows you've maybe have done the cleanest lap. You've taken maybe more risks. You've put everything on the line to go on pole. And a point for that in a tight field makes sense. In a field where only one car is going to get all the pole positions makes less sense. But in the ideal scenario of a tight field and one guy going for it in qualifying and getting that pole position, I think it could make more sense than the fastest lap of the race. I think a lot of our belief in the Constructors' title will come over the next couple of races because I think if from here to the end all the races would be Singapores, Bakus and Monzas, we would believe that we can do it. If in Austin, Mexico, Brazil that are more standard tracks, we see ourselves falling back a bit and being not so performing, like we were in Zandvoort or Spa, then obviously our belief goes down. So it's a lot trying to assess. We are coming back to normal tracks with long, combined corners, high-speed corners. Let's see where we are now in these kind of tracks and see if we can still fight like we did in Singapore and Baku and Monza. I think the others have taken this three-week break opportunity to bring upgrades to the car. Obviously, we haven't stood still and we still try to improve every single area, but it sounds like there's going to be a couple of teams maybe bringing the last upgrade and it could change a bit the pecking order. That's why I think it's important to reassess from now on. Nothing special, apart from obviously a lot of motivation to try to achieve it. Nothing would make me happier than achieving something like that before the end of the year. I'm going to give it my absolute best. If it comes, great, and I'll be for sure celebrating. And if it doesn't, you know, I don't believe it will be my last chance of fighting for wins or podiums in Formula 1, so I'll remain working hard to try to get myself in a position, even if it's with Williams or future ahead, to put myself in a position to win another race because that's what I'm hungry for and that's what I believe I can do and that's what I've proven that I can do in Ferrari. So, yeah, it doesn't end there. On one side, it's very important because obviously during those conversations with James, we did talk a lot about this year, how much they were going to improve and which position they were going to be on for 2025. And so far, he's been a man of his word and his kind of expectations, which with upgrades in Formula 1, you never know. But because you saw it clearly this year that bringing three tenths to the car doesn't always mean three tenths on paper. Yeah, he's been a man of his word in this sense, and the team seems to be taking their steps in the right direction. At the same time, this news that I was receiving from him and these promises, because they were not promises, they were expectations of the car getting quicker through the season and into next year, didn't affect that much my decision. As I said, my decision was a lot more based on the people and the feeling that I was getting from talking to the management, talking to the owners and the feeling that I was getting from the whole organisation and not so much about the short-term performance gains that they were getting. And definitely what convinced me more than the downforce they were going to add or where the team was going to be in six months, one year time, was the people and the professionalism and the vision of the project that they had. And this was the main differentiator to me. So it came along because we're neighbours in Monaco. And we've gone a couple of times In Monaco, we call them coffee rides, which is an easy ride. We just get the bike, do 30, 40 k's to a coffee place, have a coffee and come back. And that is normally the ride where the day doesn't push. So that's when cycling losers like me, that we think we're fit and we think we're strong, can join him, potentially join him to go for a coffee ride. But the reality is that during that coffee ride or that recovery ride, you're also dying by trying to follow him. or stay on his wheel. He does the favour of not dropping you because he doesn't want to… We're having conversation, even though a conversation at 170, 180 beats per minute, while he's at 110, is not the most exciting conversation because you cannot talk much. And I think he can tell. Yeah, well, first of all, only words of admiration towards Fernando and what he has achieved. It is crazy to me to think when I was growing up, nine, ten years old, he was already in F1. And now that I turned 30 myself, he's still in Formula 1. So, yeah. Quite crazy. and obviously he's still here because he wants it and he has so much talent and speed still at his age that he can allow himself to keep choosing about what to do with his future and with his life, which in a competitive field of 19 other very hungry younger drivers, that says a lot from him. From my side, I have a very good example at home with my dad, still winning Dakars at 61, 62, so I know what it takes to have at home someone that is still hungry and very motivated about what he does and my dad is a perfect example. So I can see why Fernando has a very similar approach to things because you can tell they are made of racing. They cannot live without racing. My dad wakes up every day thinking about his dampers in the Dakar and his tyres and his team, he calls his engineer every single day. And he's 62. He could be at home chilling, playing golf with me. He still decides to catch three planes to get to Morocco in the middle of the night, to test, for 24 hours, a car in the middle of the desert, and staying in not very good hotels, you know, and he still loves it. And so, yeah, I will see how I feel. I think Formula 1 calendars now are very demanding and this is going to be a very hot topic for the drivers to decide on their future, especially if you want to have kind of a stable family life when you turn 35, 40 and you start thinking about kids, etc. And this will be the main deciding factor in individual people choosing whether to take the 24 to 25 race calendar or not. So it will also depend a lot on that factor. Whether I'm there or not, I have no clue right now. But I do see myself, after 200 races in 10 years, racing for another 200, another 10 years. This I can say yes. But I don't know how it will plan out.",United States,thursday,Ferrari
Esteban Ocon,"It was good, thank you. Cycling, not as hard probably as Carlos, but, yeah, trained well, rested well, spent time with family and friends and, yeah, ready to go again. I mean, it can sound silly, but, you know, it makes a difference to how ready and how much energy all the team have coming into these last races and we'll see hopefully how that goes for us. Yeah, I mean, it's been obviously a difficult run of races with the performance of the car. That is very clear. Unfortunately, we maximised the potential in Singapore, but, you know, that wasn't enough for us to be points scorers. You know, Pierre will have upgrades. I will run the old car this weekend and we should hopefully have the upgrades for the next races onwards. So, yeah, we're excited to see what that's going to bring to the performance of the team and hopefully it will be a better position for us to end this season. Yeah, for sure. Back then, Ayao convinced me with the plan he had. He didn't specifically talk about that, but he really told me what his plan was to take this team to the next level and help on the things that the team have the chance to improve on. He convinced me back then and it reinforces me to clearly trust him for the future. I think it's exciting times for the teams ahead. I join Carlos. I think for us drivers, being on pole is something very important to us and I think to all of you guys. it's something that we put a lot of effort on and that is very rewarding. On the race, we race to win. You don't necessarily race to be fastest on one lap. I never thought that this is a good thing, to have one point, for the race. But for pole position, it would be much more rewarding and that's something I would prefer. Yeah, as a driver for the team, it's difficult to comment about this. But as a French fan of the sport and as a French driver, everything I can say is that it's a sad situation. It's very sad for French motorsport. But yeah, there's nothing more I can say. Yeah, I remember coming here in 2016 and not seeing, obviously, the grandstand being full, seeing some holes at the hill in Turn 1. Now it's very, very different. It's insane the amount of support that we receive when we come to the States. You know, it's quite special to me because I always wanted, in a way, to be able to visit the States as a kid. And, you know, being able to go now to Miami, Las Vegas, coming here in Texas for that many years, it's honestly really, really cool. So, yeah, I think it's a big, big difference compared to when I started in F1. And, yeah, looking forward to see how it's going to evolve in a couple of years. Yeah, what an impressive career. That's all I can say. Fernando breathes racing, eats racing, wakes up racing. When he has free time, he just goes go-karting. He just wants to drive and race all the time. I've talked about it for him, what motivates him. He just says he doesn't know really what else to do. It's been his life and he just enjoys racing all the time. He has nothing to prove anymore to anyone. He's one of the best ever, clearly. He's won in most of the categories that he's done. I really had a lot of learning when I was racing alongside him on a lot of different topics, inside the track, outside the track, how he raced, how he thinks outside the box. And that's clearly the things that I remember the most how he's aware strategy-wise of how things are turning out for him and where he needs to go while he's racing. That's not an easy thing to do. And yeah, well done on that 400 races. If I will be doing that many races, to be fair, I don't think so. I don't think any drivers anytime soon are going to be reaching that many races ever because he's still going and he's going to be still going for many years, I think. But yeah, what a career.",United States,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"It was good, thank you. Not a whole lot, you know, just kind of spent my time at home with the family and lived a normal life for a while. So that was nice. Yeah, refreshing myself for the last few races here. Yeah, it's not been a lot of races recently because I had that race ban. So it's just been that one race in Singapore since Monza. So it feels like a quiet time that I've had recently. I think this year we've been pretty strong at most circuits. There has been a little bit more of a competitive edge at medium downforce tracks. This one is kind of close to high downforce, so we're not so sure what we're going to run. It's not a bad track for us, I think. There's some upgrades on the car and we're excited to see if they're going to be good again. I think this year we've brought a few upgrades that have been working, so that's been a really good trend. We're in a tight fight with RB for P6 in the Constructors’ and we're very motivated to take that battle to them and see if we can. If we can beat them, you know, Williams are not that far behind us as well. So there's, you know, we're focused both in front and behind. So it's pretty interesting. Recently, we've had a slightly faster car, at least in the races. And, you know, maybe they've been a bit faster in qualifying. We've been a bit stronger in the races. So, yeah, with the upgrades this week, hopefully we can take a small step there and be that much faster in qualifying as well. Yeah, I hope so. I don't think so. I think it's a longer-term thing, but I do think it's very positive for Haas and I think a very good way to expand the operation and a very needed step, I think. I think what Haas has achieved in those years already has been quite impressive. If you actually know the operation and how small it is, it's kind of impressive what we have been able to achieve. But there has always been a feeling of potential for more. I think this is a good step to move further into that direction. I think it's going to be interesting to see where they go. Not a whole lot to add from the perspective of a midfield team. I think it's something that very rarely is on our mind. If we're in top 10, even if you're P6, P7, it's very rare that you will have a pit stop gap to go with what Carly says. For us, it's never been relevant. Well, I think for us as an American team, it's been quite significant. Having the sport grow so much in the US the last couple of years has helped us. But I think it's helped everyone in the whole sport. It's a very important demographic for any sport to break through. And I think Formula 1 has done that. A big thanks to Netflix, I think. That was kind of how a big part of those US new fans got into it, I think, with COVID hitting and F1 being the first live sport or the first sport to go live during COVID and Drive to Survive, the first season coming out at the same time and everything was like the perfect storm. So I think it's something that is noticeable for us and something very good for the sport. It's a big challenge in terms of cooling the car. It's an odd race because we run with basically the most downforce we can, and the cars have about the same downforce as we do in Mansa, despite the big wings. And cooling the brakes and the engine and the gearbox is very tricky there, so it's a pretty inefficient race aerodynamically for the cars and things are harder to control. As a consequence I had that rear suspension failure because of hot rear brakes last year. I think physically you feel it too, it's just thin air, you're breathing more and you do notice it. It's not really a huge issue as such, it's just something you notice. It's not a very physical race and it's very rarely hot up there, so for a driver it's not really a big challenge, more for the cars.",United States,thursday,Haas
Alex Albon,"Not really. The first race. The first race is always a big moment. And then my first podium is always nice. But yeah, it's strange. I feel like 100 races. when we do so many races a year now, it doesn't actually take a lot. It's four years now in Formula 1, four and a half. It's gone by very quickly. I think somebody told me that I've overtaken Sir Jackie Stewart, which is a pretty strange feeling. We've had a good run of races. I do feel like we've made a step since our upgrade. We're still not totally happy with where the car is, and we know that there's more understanding to happen and more to come with that. So we had a good amount of time to go through the data the last few weeks just to see where we can go quicker. I do think we're going to need that bit more performance to score more points. But we're on a good trend right now. I feel like the momentum is with us. So, yeah, I don't see why we can't score points in the next remaining races and especially this weekend. Anything's possible, but I think if you look at where the top four teams are at right now, we are fighting for, the best case, P9, P10, and unfortunately the gap from, especially RB, at the beginning of the year, the gap they grew to us, if you're only scoring one or two points a weekend, you're never going to be able to catch up. So we need something to happen, you know, one of those crazy races, which, to be fair to you, Mexico, Brazil, the weather and the starts can always create something. It's never out of the question, but we're going to need a little bit more. Definitely. It helps in many ways, obviously, for me to have a benchmark, but also in terms of strategy. We can do things. Especially in the midfield, where it's so tight, you are actually quite reliant on strategy to score points. The midfield battle is split by pretty much a tenth and a half, two tenths across everyone. There's a very big trend this year where one driver goes short and one driver goes long in the first stint. When you can have a driver who's able to be there and to do maybe the opposite or try and pull another driver in front away from whatever situation we may need, it becomes really useful. I'm impressed. I wouldn't say surprised. I think he was quick already in the test he did at Silverstone this year and he's just taken it very comfortably. It looks like he's not tense about it. He's relaxed, which is the best thing you can be when you're being put into a Formula 1 car in the middle of the season. So, yeah, not surprised, but pleasantly impressed. Yeah, I'd say so. I mean, in the end, we're not really too focused on it as drivers. We just focus more on ourselves and our own performances. Where it's useful is the feedback. It's the work being done in the simulator, as Lando and Liam's been talking about, you know, to have that experience, to have quick drivers, smart drivers who can lead some of the development of the car, that's where it becomes really, really handy. We have a very strong line-up now, even in the simulator work that we do, including drivers like Zak (O’Sullivan). There's a good path now, I think, especially if you look at where the Williams Academy is growing. It's been done really well as well in terms of psychology, physicality, there's a big process being done behind the scenes. And I think you're seeing the benefits and the work that's being done.",United States,thursday,Williams
Lando Norris,"A little bit of everything, honestly. I mean, after Singapore, I just wanted to keep going. We were in a good rhythm. I think we still are in a good rhythm and have been for quite a while. So a little bit of that. But everyone needs a break. And it's not just for me, but for my whole team, the whole team around me, everyone back in the factory. It's nice to kind of regroup and put our heads down again. Yeah, a mixture of things. Obviously, getting ready for the next few races and the end of the season, but also getting some time to relax and spending some time with my friends. Yeah, I think so. Probably more, I would say. If you look at where we were last year here, relative with the car that we had, comparing to where we were in Singapore, I think this was a better weekend for us. We led the first half of the race. I know some things were mixed up because of different scenarios, It was a good weekend. And again, some of the things have changed again on this track, with the new surfaces and some of the layout has changed a little bit. So always questions for us to go and answer. But with how we performed last year, with how we're performing over the last, you know, three, four, five races, I think we're confident everywhere that we should be towards the top. I mean, I have no idea if it's going to be a good thing or a bad thing. I don't think anyone does. So I think we probably all treat it as opportunities until we know something different. But it's also a Sprint race where many things can happen and it's difficult to sometimes hit the ground running. And we saw that last year with people not getting the set-ups right and certain things like that. So again, certain things have changed for what happened last year in that scenario. But no, I think everyone's going to see these races as opportunities and we do too. So that's a good thing. I think we've seen it for the last five, six weekends. I know people ask every weekend if this is a weekend that's going to change something. It can go my way. It can go Max's way. So I keep focused on doing what I'm doing. I've been doing a good job. I'm happy with how things have gone. Like I said, I've not been happy with always the final result for different reasons. But I'm happy with what we're doing as a team and how we're working together. And I'm confident if we just keep our heads down and keep pushing, we can do it and we can close the gap. It's not easy. I need more than just me first and Max second. But I can't change that. So I just need to focus on myself and leave the rest to everyone else. I mean, it's one thing having it on your car. It's another thing on how much you exploit it and use it, which we have no idea on. If it has been helping them, if they've been utilising it in the way people think they have, then maybe it will shift in our direction. But, I mean, when you talk about things like that, it's not going to gain them… They're not going to have got several pole positions or wins just because of such a device. I don't think it really will change anything in the scheme of things. But when we look at maybe certain qualifyings and we look at the gap in certain races this year, when it's been split by hundredths of a second in qualifying or even thousandths, then you might say, ‘OK, well, maybe this has helped in that direction or this direction’. But I think it's good that the FIA are doing such a thing. There's a difference between black and white stuff like this, and there's a difference between Formula 1 and pushing the boundaries and creating new things and innovating within the space that you're allowed to innovate. And I think that's what we as McLaren have done a very good job in. But we're sure not to go any further than that. No. I wouldn't look at that as the reason. I'd probably put the blame down to other things this season that could have been better, rather than Daniel in his final race getting a fastest lap. It might come down to that in the end of the year. And if that's the case, then so be it. But I don't think that's… People have done that for years. I know it's just odd timing and people are quick to jump on things, but it depends if it's… The circumstance of how it happened, I guess, is a unique one. Daniel knew it was his last race. And I wouldn't say it's a nice way to go out, because I don't think any way to go out is a nice one. But yeah, if it wasn't and it was just him going for fastest lap, then it's a bit more of a question mark and something, I think, we probably would have questioned more as a team. And I know they're changing the rules for next year and these kind of things. But if it was a repetitive thing, if it was to happen again this weekend or next weekend, then I think that's where we would probably classify it or question it in a much deeper manner. But considering how things were and, I don't know. I don't want to just say I accept it because it was his final race because it’s got nothing to do for his championship or their championship. You know, it was something to take away from me, but I would never blame Daniel. I would never blame them. But if it's done with intent to do such a thing, then it's obviously not what we agree with. And I don't think something that Formula 1 would agree with either. So the answer is no, I wouldn't blame it on this. It would be down to other reasons. I have no idea. I don't know why they've done it. I kind of liked how it is now. I mean, you know, there's an opportunity to go for something else. Sometimes you pay the price for risking such a thing, and it's always been a risk in certain scenarios. if your pit stop goes wrong, you know, different reasons. The thing is, if it's such a case, then it's like we had in Singapore or something like that. that's repetitive, then I think it's the correct thing to do. But I don't know. I don't feel like they should change it just because of people questioning it after Singapore. So I don't know. It's got nothing to do with me. It was all a team manager thing. So yeah, it's got nothing to do with us. I think it's still been a good year, like it's still been a year I've enjoyed. It's tough because you never know… There's always things, no matter what year you're in, that you think, you know, you could have done this a bit better, you could have done that better. And even with where I am now, there's already things I go, ‘damn, if only I did this or that’, I'm not going to say where, but different scenarios. when if I lose a championship by a couple of points that I can easily look at and go, I made probably a wrong decision here and I could have lost it. If I win it by one point, I'm sure there'll be things that Max says, which is like, ‘oh, I probably lost it here as well’. So it's easy to come up with excuses and reasons for things. If I finish second, it's because Red Bull and Max have done a better job. That's my only answer for it. We started a very long way behind in the beginning of the year. I think everyone thought Max was going to have an easy win in the championship. Red Bull were going to have another easy win in the championship. For that not to be the case after the gap that they had after round one, and it not even to come from Ferrari as the main contender, but from us, a team that was probably fourth at the start of the year, I think it's still a year to be proud of. But as the season goes on, you always re-evaluate where do we stand now and what are our new expectations. And our expectations now and actually for a while have been we're a top team and we're fighting for wins and we're fighting for a Constructors’ Championship and we're fighting for a Drivers' Championship. Just as much as it can go wrong it can also go well like it has done for us and we're fighting against the best of the best and it's been a fun year. But I think no matter what it's still been a successful season. But yeah, i'm sure I'll be happier with a win than if it was for second. You pay attention to every driver. Yeah, I mean, that's my job is to look at onboards and look at data, but it's got nothing to do with me. You know, if Max qualifies first, fifth or 10th, it doesn't change what I have to do. My job is still to try and win and get the most points I can for myself, whether that includes trying to get a fastest lap, I did that a few times this year and it could be that those few times I have got them can help me in the championship at the end of the year. Honestly, not a lot. I mean, he's my contender. He's the guy I need to beat. So when he's just ahead of me, then I know, just like in Baku, that one position swing, me going one forward and him going one back, can make a big difference in a championship. And you just want that rhythm, you know, you want that rhythm of me gaining points on him and never kind of a hold. And that's how things have gone the last few weeks. But, no, I just focus on myself, like I said before, and Max finishes wherever he finishes. Is it a risk? I think it's still a risk, for sure. I think what you're seeing is very talented drivers come through. I feel like I'm older when I say it, but, you know, like Liam, like Oscar, like Franco, I think you're going to see plenty of drivers come in and do a good job and perform and qualify well and things like that. I think that's what comes more natural to drivers. But I think when you look at Formula 1, Formula 1 is not just about one weekend or two weekends or three weekends. It's about 24 and it's about a whole season and it's about developing the car over seasons. And I think you'll see, and I think there are plenty of drivers that can come in and drive a Formula 1 car quickly. And I think that's the easier part of it, is coming in and just driving a car quickly. This is what we're born to do, is what we live doing, is driving as quickly as we can. And I think the easier part of that is coming in and driving a car quickly. The tough part is the longer part of everything. It's the 24 races. not crashing your car every weekend, not making those silly mistakes, helping your team, being a team leader, not just looking at this season, but looking ahead to next year and on knowing when to make sacrifices for following years. There's plenty of things which make a driver a more complete driver rather than someone who can just come in and perform on one weekend. And I'm not taking anything away at all from those guys. Like when you see Franco come in and do the job he's done in the middle of a season, it's pretty impressive. And I think everyone acknowledges that, but it's another job to do that every single weekend, not making mistakes, not crashing the car, especially now in a cost cap championship, it's even trickier to push and find those limits. So you have those pros and cons, but being a Formula 1 driver is not about just driving a car quickly, which I think a lot of people can do, but it's about doing that on top of doing that every single race, every single qualifying, working together as a team. I think that's what makes a good driver in general, not just a quick driver. So you have those two sides, but I'm still impressed. And I think it's still impressive to see the rates of how quick you can get these young drivers in now. And not talking as I'm old, but these young drivers like Franco come in and perform at the level that they have done so quickly. So it's down to different reasons, but also simulators and things like that and preparation you can do nowadays is more advanced than what it was several years ago. I mean, the second part first. I think I'm always going to find it odd. Maybe it takes a few more years to settle in, but I still feel like it wasn't that long ago that I was watching it on TV and I was watching Fernando, Lewis, Jenson, all of these guys. And now that's me in that position, so I still find that odd, but extremely cool at the same time and still lucky and honoured to be in the position that I'm in, especially with McLaren in Formula 1. And 100%, that fighting for a championship brings a lot more focus because… I think it switched a long time ago, honestly. I think it switched probably closer towards Miami time. I think that's how early we kind of realised this could be a year that things can start to go quite well for us. It was obvious by then that more focus, more work needs to be done in every area possible. Some of it came after, you know. I think we've seen plenty of times, probably races we kind of regret not winning. Probably Silverstone being the main one that I think didn't go our way it should have done. And I think we look back on that with a bit of regret that we didn't end up in better positions than where we ended up in. I think almost since Silverstone, probably more so, there was quite a renewed focus from everyone. And not just including me, or not just me, but including mechanics, engineers, everyone back in the factory, because it became more and more real, a little bit with time, that we're back in a position that we've worked very, very hard to be in, which is fighting for the championship and fighting for both the Constructors’ and for a Drivers’ championship. I'm loving it. It's definitely more enjoyable. It's always going to be more enjoyable when you're fighting for wins and you're fighting for a championship. But I'm still relaxed. There's more pressure and a few more nerves, but I'm honestly still very relaxed and pretty chilled about the whole thing. I'm sure it's going to get pretty more stressful and the later into the season you go, the trickier it gets, for sure. But I'm happy. I'm in a comfortable place. I'm focused on myself. And, yeah, I'm enjoying the whole moment.",United States,thursday,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Warm is how it was! It was a good race, a good recovery from qualifying yesterday. It wasn't my greatest afternoon yesterday, so to get back to the podium is a great result. I feel like we had a really quick car underneath us and a good strategy to get past the Mercedes. So, yeah, big thank you to the team. Clearly, the car was exceptional this weekend and some great points for the whole team. No, I think I kept it off them this time. I don't think I hit anything. It was a bit close George at Turn 1, but once I got into third, I had a massive gap to try and close up, so I didn't want to take too many risks, but, yeah, I feel like I've brushed enough walls in the last two weeks, so hopefully the mechanics don't have to change too many bits before then next race. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, you know, yesterday obviously wasn't ideal, but today the aim was to get onto the podium. And I think losing so much time behind the Mercedes in the first thing meant that that was definitely the most we could have done. So walking away reasonably happy. Of course, I'd prefer to be sat in the middle. But I think it was a good damage limitation day today. Even through the weekend, I was struggling quite a lot in practice and felt like I made a good step into qualifying. Didn't execute as well as I needed to, but I feel like I've learned a lot through the weekend as well. So even if the end result wasn't exactly what I hoped, I think we've done a good job of maximising the points, especially for the team. It's a massive points haul for us, and I feel like I've learned some good lessons for next year as well. All in all, reasonably happy. It was difficult for the last few laps of the stint, but until then I could tell that we had a good pace advantage over Mercedes. And Lewis starting on the Soft meant that I was never really going to try and push to get him early on. I knew that the race was going to come to me much later on, and that's basically what we did. So, yeah, when I was in the dirty air behind them, it was tough, as it always is, but I knew that we had a good pace advantage and that the longer we kept going the more opportunities we opened up for ourselves the bigger tyre difference we had. If there was a Safety Car then we could have capitalised on it. So I think we executed it very well. The last few laps, it was trying to yeah get the team to pit me but It was all you know, pretty much under control. It was a tough race, definitely. Not on the same level as what we had in Qatar last year, I would say, but to be honest, it almost gets harder when it gets lonely. Once I got past the Mercedes, Max was, I think, 20 seconds ahead, and I knew I was a lot quicker than the Mercedes, so the last 15 laps felt longer than the first 45. So yeah, it was a tough race, definitely. It always is here. But in some ways having the air blowing in your face and stuff like that is almost quite nice. You know, the in-lap was actually probably... You know, when you stop concentrating so much and you don't have as much air in your face, it actually can feel worse. So definitely a tough evening, but that's what we're paid for. I mean clearly in the Constructors’ the trajectory has been in the right direction for a long time now. We've got clearly a quick car underneath us. we've got both of us scoring big points consistently. So yeah, I feel like we're doing a good job as a whole team but you can never take it for granted how quickly things can turn around, so we'll see. And I'm not sure Lando's going to give an answer. I mean, I guess you guys didn't really test it, so... It didn't change the world, to be honest. Both of my overtakes were into Turn 7, so... Yeah, I think that part of the track where the new DRS zone is very slippery, so actually trying to stay close to someone is very tough. And the straight is still not long enough really to make big inroads, so I think it didn't make that much of a difference to be honest.",Singapore,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think that's pretty much my race, just by myself. Trying to do the best I could, trying to manage my own pace to the end. I think the first stint was a bit difficult for us, quite a bit of tyre degradation. Second stint was a bit better. I was a bit more comfortable as well. So, yeah, I think on a weekend where we knew that we were going to struggle to be P2 is a good achievement. Of course, we're not happy with second. Now we just have to try and improve more and more, and that's what we'll try to do. Yeah, it is, but this also can change very quickly again, so we just need to keep on trying, of course, at one point try to overturn it a bit, you know, not always finishing behind, but we'll see how that goes. It's always tough around here, warm, and a very long race in general, so I'm looking forward to a bit of rest. Compared to the start of the weekend, we improved quite nicely. I think that's been great for us as a team. On a track that we know we're not performing normally the best. I'm happy with second today. I would say the end the last few laps. I think it was feeling a little bit better. But yeah, overall, quite a lonely race for me. Of course, that was a joke, but I'm not surprised. I mean, I think Lando drove a great race and he had a great weekend, that's for sure. We always want to do better and we'll analyse a lot and hopefully we'll come out stronger in Austin and from there onwards more. Yeah, I mean, everyone can decide when they want to do a fast slap or not. Yeah. It's always difficult to say if it's too much or not. It was a different direction. that maybe gives us some ideas for the future. It was a big turnaround, but biggest or I don't know. It's always difficult to say. Yeah, time will tell, right? All right. Probably street circuits we’ll struggle more, normal tracks a little bit less. Yeah, pretty pleased, but still a lot of work to do. We know that. Hopefully now we can really kickstart things. We focus on performance. If the car is quick, then naturally both championships are easier to get. It's been a long day, yeah.",Singapore,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Thank you. It was an amazing race. A few too many close calls. You know, I had a couple little moments in the middle, but it was well-controlled, I think, otherwise. And the car was mega, so I could push. We were flying the whole race, and yeah, at the end, I could just chill. So it was a nice race, still tough. I'm a bit out of breath, but a very fun one. I mean, it's not that you're necessarily over-pushing. Sometimes it can be that you're just chilling too much. Maybe it was a bit of both. I don't know what it is, but it's tricky. It was still tough out there, easy to lock the tyres like I did. I still pushed. I didn't want to have a one-second lead. I wanted to have the biggest lead possible. It was good fun, maximum points. Nice to have Oscar here, too, on the podium. He drove well today, so a good day for the team also. Similar to Qatar last year, but I wasn't taking it easy. I could have taken it a lot more easy. Yeah, a little dizzy at the minute, but all good. Just a win is a win. So yeah, maybe it puts a slightly bigger smile on your face but the main job is just getting the win. So, it's satisfying no matter what. Of course the bigger the gap you can have the happier you're going to be but I'm just happy we finished on top and we got maximum points and got another win. It's always going to be a tough race here, but I felt good all weekend, so all I had to do was go out there and perform like I've been performing and all things were going to go well. I mean, very, I was flat out. I was probably pushing a bit too hard. Yeah, it was definitely not like I was cruising. I was pushing to open up a gap, and at one point I wanted to try and open up a pit window to give myself an opportunity to maybe box at the end of the race for quickest lap if I needed to try and achieve that. Daniel stole that away from me at the end of the race. So, yeah, a tough one, but it wasn't easy. The car was not easy to drive, especially on the Hard tyres. I struggled a lot more than what I did on the Medium. And especially just with the traffic and things, it was a bit harder to manage the second half of the stint compared to the first, but I was pushing. Let me tell you, I was definitely pushing. Probably too much, hence the mistakes I was making, or the two mistakes I made with the wall, but otherwise things were going well. I don't think so. I mean, the team said that there was something with the front wing, maybe being a little bit off. I hit the front wing against the barrier, so it might have tweaked it a touch, but I don't think probably much to change it, but hard to know. On these cars, as soon as you tweak something a tiny bit, it can have quite a big impact, but nothing that I was probably feeling. But yes, as soon as I did that, and I think it was more… I mean, I was pushing, but also it was just as I was catching up to the dirty air from the cars ahead, whether they were three, four seconds ahead, as soon as... It changes from the past, you know, 20 laps that I had. You have a little bit less grip, a little bit less downforce. Tyres are going away a little bit. It just caught me out. So it wasn't like a lack of concentration or anything. It was just a bit of a surprise to me. But, yeah, I think the car was all good and the car has been mega weekend. So a big thanks to the team. We've not changed anything on the car from here to last weekend or the weekend before. We've even had to make tweaks to some of our wings and things that people have complained about. But we've still had a great weekend and probably one of our most dominant weekends here. I don't think that's made the difference, honestly. It was just that the car's been mega for a good amount of time. I've not been able to come out on top for for quite a few of them when I felt like I had the pace and I had the ability to do. So some of that is down to being my own fault and not executing things well enough. So I've paid the price for not doing a good enough job at times. But when I lead after Turn 1 and things are a a bit more straightforward then we can have a day like today. Silly question, really, isn't it? Try and do the same again, but Max is pushing hard. I'm sure Red Bull are pushing hard. So, I mean, it's obvious it's... I'm doing my best every weekend. I'm trying to get the most points I can every weekend. Includes fastest lap and things like that. But if Max keeps finishing second and Red Bull keep doing like they did this weekend, then nothing more I can do. So just focus on myself and focus on us as a team. That's it. Well done, Daniel. I don't know. Nothing I can do is good on him. Yeah, I did my best at trying to get a quicker slap when the tyres were in a good condition in the middle. But I can't have them all, you know. I've done my best at trying to get quicker slaps over the last few weekends and I've been able to get them more often than not. But I can't, on a hard tyre in the middle of a stint, beat a guy on a new soft. So, yeah, that's just life. That's how it's been in Formula 1 for, I don't know, probably since before I was born, so... Nothing to complain about. There's been races in the past when other people have been racing. We try to take it away from others. So, yes, the logical thing to do. The smart play by them. Happy for Daniel. That's all. We have no idea, mate. I don't know. I can't tell the future, so... I'm working as hard as I can, like I just said. I'm sure Red Bull, Max as well, so... I'm sure there's going to be plenty of competition until the end of the year, and as a team, the only thing we can do is try and score the most points possible. That includes trying to win. Yeah, it's, again, a silly question. I mean, we're doing our best, and so are they. I hope so. I still have a lot of points I've got to catch up and it's not going to be easy to do it. It's against Red Bull and it's against Max, the most dominant pairing you've ever seen in Formula 1, from last year. And that's not necessarily changed in terms of… It's the same team and it's the same driver. So I have some of the toughest competition that Formula 1 has ever seen in the sport. We are doing a better job as a team right now because my car and our car is quicker than theirs. But that's just credit to the team doing an amazing job and being smarter and doing cooler things and creating mini DRS flaps and stuff, you know. So it's just because that's the game and that's the people we're up against, the people who also do it and people who create these things. So I'm working my heart out, I'm working my butt off, to try and make sure that happens. He's trying to make sure it doesn't happen. So we'll have to wait and find out. The same.",Singapore,post-race,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I think we had a solid quali, a solid day in general with the two cars. And I think we put ourselves in a very good position for tomorrow. I've never really been 100% hooked up around here in my career. It's a track that I tend to struggle a bit, so to be P3 is a good position for tomorrow, as also my race pace yesterday seemed strong, so all to play for tomorrow. Yeah, definitely. The track was ramping up a lot and we were getting more and more grip as the track cools down and the sun goes down. So it was all about adapting. I found something going into Q3 that gave me a bit more confidence. Yeah, probably wasn't the best of build-ups to do that Q3 lap, but at least I found something that allowed me to put it into the top three, which is a decent position for tomorrow. If I would have been a bit quicker, yes, but it's Baku where I've never been my best version of myself around here. But I think tomorrow we can be. I think it's extremely tight. I think it's obviously one of... Charles was mentioning it’s one of his best tracks and he tends to always find a couple of tenths on the Ferrari around here and that probably makes us look like the fastest car, but I think it's honestly within two tenths between the top four cars and it makes it an exciting battle and an exciting race for tomorrow. Yeah, but I managed to find a couple of things in Q3 that gave me a bit more pace than what I was showing in Q1 and Q2. Probably found it a bit too lat. By the time I found them, I wish I would have had more laps before to get used to driving the car a bit like that. And I felt like I was more competitive. But, you know, it's always been a track that I struggle a lot at. It's the best track for Charles and one of the worst ones for me, and I'm glad to be P3 and have a good position going into tomorrow, although it's something that I keep working on around here because from FP1 I always tend to lack a bit of rhythm and I need to build it up. Nothing that I can reveal obviously in a press conference, because I would be revealing a bit too much, but just little things. Little things that you can do in quali to get the car to stop a bit better in the long braking zones, that gives you a bit more confidence to brake those three to five metres later that around here is fundamental. It's interesting because I normally feel very comfortable in city tracks like Singapore, Monaco or any, but Baku has never been, in my 10 years in Formula 1, one of those. But every year I come back here trying to improve myself, trying to find more of an edge in my driving, but it just doesn't come very natural to me. Yeah, for sure. I mean, the braking, no. It's all about braking here in Baku and having the confidence to stop the car as late as possible, trusting that the car then is going to turn in into the corner. And yeah, that's where he excels around here and where he's particularly comfortable from the beginning of FP1. From my side, I don't know why I don't have exactly that same feeling that I have in Singapore, maybe on the higher downforce, or in Monaco with higher downforce, but it's what it is. I still think I made some good progress. I'm going into tomorrow into the top three. So, yeah, I still think we're in the mix. It was, I think, a matter of… I think we both went in the middle of the session in Q2 while every other team waited until the track evolution. We prioritised putting a lap in the middle of Q2 to be safe going into Q3, and that left us exposed to no tow. And yeah, we were just making sure that for Q3 we were having one. That is when it counts. I think the biggest challenge of Baku normally is when there are red flags because that breaks the rhythm of the race. I remember one year there was two or three red flags on the same race and that really breaks the rhythm of the race. and then you have to wait while they clear the track, and obviously that is the biggest thing. Then the Safety Cars. Here it's very difficult to keep temperature in the tyres, so whenever there's a Safety Car restart, it's very easy to front lock, very easy to go wide into the first three corners. So yeah, all these aspects make Baku an unpredictable race, because as soon as there's one curve ball, like a Safety Car or a red flag, it actually generates even more chaos after, as a snowball effect. I'm going to sound boring, but I don't need any music. I'm already pumped up and nervous enough, having the goosebumps before the race to even put something on my ear to pump me up even more. I actually just talked a bit with myself. Sometimes I need to, if I pump myself up, I do a stronger warm up. If I need to calm down, I have a bit more time to chill. I tell you one thing that pumps me up here is the Azerbaijan anthem. It's quite strong here. It's a good one. And it's an anthem that when we're standing on the grid is very powerful, actually, and it's good fun.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"I just got a bit closer to the walls and on the last lap got a little bit too close! But yeah, just tried to really get the most out of it. This track really rewards commitment. So yeah, the last laps in Q3, I knew I had a lot less to lose. So just try and maximise the car. I was feeling good all the way through. Just didn't maximize it that much in the first part of qualifying. But no, very happy with Q3. I think from where we're starting, yes. But I think following around here is going to be really tough. We saw yesterday that it was pretty tough once you get behind someone. So hopefully I can get some clean air and that would be good. But yeah, we'll see what we can do. I think our race pace is good. But again, the Ferrari is certainly not slow. Definitely. Maybe not the messiest ever, but it certainly wasn't the cleanest. A few big moments in there and a couple of love taps with the wall. So, yeah, I mean, I pushed to get everything out of it that I could. And, yeah, maybe a little bit too much in some places, but I don't think I had enough to get polled today, so... I'm pretty happy with the front row. And yeah, hopefully we can try and put up a fight tomorrow. I don't think that much in the end. I think the used tyres I did, I did more or less half a lap on it. So it wasn't completely used. And around here, the tyres have been a little bit strange, I would say. And just with the track evolution, it's more about doing a good lap rather than having the perfect set of tyres. So I was pretty happy with P3 after the first set. And then I found a little bit more on the second set of tyres. So yeah, I was pretty happy with that. No. It was just getting faster and faster. I think from the start of FP1 to now… Normally we go maybe three seconds faster or maybe four in some places, but here it's been, I don't know what the number is, but it's like seven or eight. So, you really had to adapt a lot through the weekend and try to adapt your driving to the track you've got and adapt the car to what the track is going to be, which always makes life a little bit more difficult for the engineers and for us. But, yeah, it's never stabilized. And I think on a street circuit, it never will. It will just continue to get better and better. Probably whoever finishes in front tomorrow, I would say! I don't know. I think it's very, very even. Through all of practice it looked very tight between us, Ferrari, Mercedes and Red Bull. To be honest, I was a bit surprised Red Bull weren't a bit further up at the end of Q3, but I think our race pace looked good yesterday, but nowadays the top four teams are so close in race pace that qualifying often makes a massive difference. So I've got confidence that our car will be quick. But yeah, I think there's definitely seven other cars out on the track that are certainly not any slower. Honestly, I was pretty happy with it. We had a bit to find for sure. But yeah, I think I said yesterday I felt like we were in the ball park. And yeah, I'm not massively surprised to be sat here. But, yeah, I definitely didn't feel like we were the quickest yesterday. But, again, I feel like it's so close between the top four teams that you never quite know who's going to come out on top. Red Bull were looking very quick at certain points. Ferrari obviously looking very quick. Even Mercedes at points as well. So, yeah, I always thought we were in a pretty good place. So, yeah, not that surprised to be here. No! Maybe I should. I honestly don't listen to anything. When we're in Europe, I normally end up listening to whatever Lando listens to because it's at a volume loud enough for both of us. And then, I mean, whatever they play on the grid, you can kind of listen to whatever you want, but especially when we go to like the Netherlands, yeah… I don't know how your calming music works in Zandvoort, but normally whatever they play on the grid, which to be honest is normally my kind of music anyway, but in a few places it's a bit much and you just kind of... You have to shout sometimes to speak to your engineers, which is a little bit frustrating, but it's all for the atmosphere.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, well, I mean, it's one of my favourite track of the season. I really like it. It hasn't been an easy weekend because obviously the crash in FP1, which didn't make me lose confidence, I knew that the pace was there, but obviously you've got to build back up to speed. Then in FP2, we had a problem on a new part we brought on the car and there was something wrong there. So we lost another half an hour and then it’s laps that you don't really recover. So I was not worried, but I knew that we had to make up some time. But the pace was always there. And then in qualifying, until Q3, it was all about trying to stay as far as possible off the walls. And then in that last lap, I went for it a bit more. And the lap time came very nicely. I mean, the car felt really good and everything felt great. So, yeah, it's amazing to be on pole. Let's say it's the best we could have hoped for. I mean normally the even side of the grid has a little bit less grip, so first and third is where you want to start and hopefully we can play a team game tomorrow to win that race. But it's going to be a long race. In the past we were very strong in qualifying struggling a bit in the race. This year we have a stronger race car, so I hope that we can finally make it tomorrow. Oh, definitely. I mean, tyre management will be a big thing tomorrow as well. So we've got to do a good job. We've done a really good job in Monza. But yeah, as I said, we have to reset every race as we do. And that's what we did. So tomorrow is another race with other issues, even though tyre degradation is there. It's with different tyres. So you've got to adapt to that. And we'll do our homework tonight to get ready for tomorrow. Well, it was a good lap. I just took a little bit more risk compared to the first attempt in Q3. It was important to just have a lap on the board, and then in the second lap, you just take more risk and see what happens. Luckily, I finished both of the laps, and they were good laps. The car felt really good since FP1. Honestly, we barely changed the car from FP1 to now. Straight away, I felt happy and the balance remained really good. We had to counter a little bit the track evolution because there's a lot of track evolution here, but the feeling was there straight away in FP1, even though there were not many laps in FP1 and FP2. That didn't stop us to recover after that and to be at ease for all the weekend. This I don't know. I've been thinking about it. And obviously, whenever you have a good weekend, you try to analyse. But I don't really have a strong answer to it. I guess it just goes with my driving style very naturally, because most of the time, you have to work a lot to try and gain lap time. But there, I just feel good with the rhythm of this track for some reason. And yeah, that makes it a particularly good track for me. I mean, I didn't do a lap with high fuel, but it's been a pretty strong point of the car this year. So I am not worried going into tomorrow's race, but obviously we need to do things right. So I'll have to do a bit of homework tonight in order to get ready for tomorrow, but I'm not too worried that we'll do the best job with our package and then we'll see whether it's good enough to win the race tomorrow or not. It would be nice. I mean, in ‘21 and... No. Yeah, ‘21 and ‘20, I think, it was quite unexpected, the pole position. So we didn't have the pace in the car to win. No, sorry, ‘21 and ‘23. In 22, we had a good car, and then the engine blew up. So, hopefully tomorrow the pace is there, and we don't have anything that stops us to win it. But again, before thinking about the final result, there are still lots of laps around this track, and it's a very difficult track. So we'll see tomorrow. But in the meantime, I'll just make sure that I am doing the best preparation possible. Oh, no, no, it was nothing down to Carlos. It was just because I was the first car of the group, so I had nobody in front, but there was no... Yeah, we didn't plan anything between the cars. I just wish there was maybe another team in front and I didn't want to be the first car. And on a track like this it makes a bit of a difference and I also saw Max's lap in Q2 who had a massive tow in the last sector, so I just didn't want to be losing out to pole in Q3 because of something like that, so I was just making sure that the team knew that it was going to be important for Q3. No, it's not the best. I think the ‘21 one was probably the best as we were in a very, very difficult year. I think we were fighting for P9, P10, that championship and to be on pole here was very special. However, it was a good lap. I mean, it was a really good lap. Again, there's not... For some reason, there's not that much scatter between my laps on this track. It looks like I'm very consistent. But again, I don't really have the magic answer. But I just like the rhythm of this track. And every lap I was doing was quite competitive from FP1. And the balance was feeling really good. So the lap was good. It was really good. But yeah, it's also very difficult to compare it to other years. I like instrumental, motivational music. It's like the movie music. That gives me a lot of energy before getting into the car. But if I am too tense, which doesn't happen very often, but it did on a few occasions, like Monaco maybe, before the start this year, then it's more calming music, and it's very calm, just to release the tension a little bit. But yeah, otherwise, instrumental, motivational music. Before Monaco, I did, because that's a lot more calming than the other type of songs I normally listen to. Do you listen to my songs?",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Zhou Guanyu,"Honestly, I think just enjoy the weekend because I think… especially, I think, for Ollie who has already done a whole weekend. He know how this is feeling. And for Franco, I think he will just enjoy all the races, like I did in my first season. I mean you know like the circumstances are different but I think every driver especially in F2 really wants to take that chance and here is the perfect platform for them to shine and have a nice future. So, yeah, I just wish them all the best but not to go too fast though and stay behind. You know, every weekend we're like… Obviously we're having a similar package for a few races in a row now, but like every weekend we're trying to extract as much as we could. Like together with me and my teammate, we try to have a different set up to understand what is needed for the current situation to make a bigger step even for the next coming races, or for the future development. So it's a tough situation at the moment, just because I think we don't really have the pace for fighting anywhere close to the top 10. And we keep the, let's say, motivation high and we want to learn as much as we could in every circumstance and to understanding therefore, high downforce track, low downforce track, and then see how it goes. Also, here in Baku and Singapore, because I think the last two races, the coming two, will be completely different circumstances. But yeah, it's a difficult one to give a very high expectation, but we are trying to work in each individual areas that current weakness and trying to solve that. And hopefully that can give us better coming up races. And in terms of performance, we can be fighting more close up. I think it makes us more hopeful for sure for the race. I think the race will never end until the last laps. And for us in the past, I think this not being one of the tracks we've been especially struggling a lot with and we're just hoping with what we have this year so far that can give us a better overall performance and in terms of using as much as we could with the benefits of the current car. And yeah, the rest we need to go step by step from FP1 and see how it goes. And I think the most important is a lot of circumstances or tracks we go to when the car, you put that on ground, it is working well and then you have a really good weekend. So we just need a few more of these, back like the beginning of the season, and then we should be in a much better position. Actually, I don't know how the new car, by the sound of it, looks a bit different. On the old one, actually, it wasn't a massive difference in terms of the low speed. But, of course, the biggest feedback we had was the power steering wheel when it came, and also the high-speed downforce, because suddenly you are approaching a high speed with much higher minimum speed and with the lightness on the wheel that doesn't really give you the confidence to be pushing the car around for the first time when you tried it. Yeah, I think the whole, back in the factory, how as a team, a group of people working F2, compared to Formula 1, it's a completely different world, because obviously everything you are communicating with two of the engineers only in F2, and they're helping with everything, starts, car balance setups, and there's so limited, only certain things you can do. But here, you can change every single part on the car and try to... make the benefit of it. So I think it is a big step, but it is a good one to be, of course, get yourself as much prepared as possible to be ready for F1 chance. Honestly, obviously it's quite sensitive, these cars. Especially, I think, every car is built different. Some of the team is a little bit more sensitive than the others. And Baku has been one of the windy tracks, but I think, yes, Zandvoort, it doesn't get much worse than that, to be honest. So Zandvoort, I remember, it changed a lot of the settings and braking to Turn 1 for the high speed in Turn 8, 9. So every session, we try to check the wind and not get very communication with the engineer on the radio before breaking especially into Turn 1 when you start your flying lap. I think all this information that's where really makes important information when it comes to quality. So , we are monitoring every wind change every single weekend and I remember some tracks that we have to change all the settings we had due to different wind circumstances, different positions. So yeah F1 car is definitely one of the toughest one to understand that because in other category you don't really feel much on that.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Sauber
Fernando Alonso,"Well, it has been a positive week, for sure, for the team with the announcement and yeah, he's a great addition to the team. And probably, for me, what I think is that the Aston Martin team is the team of the future, in a way. We are just opening new buildings at the factory, the campus. Building 2 is finished. Wind tunnel will be January. Honda, Aramco, the best partners in the world, probably, and now Adrian as well. So, yeah, I think the team is taking shape and Lawrence’s vision is taking shape. So, yeah, good news this week. Well, it’s a question for him. I texted him, for sure, like everybody did probably, that you know, wanted to work with him. And yeah, I saw him also at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix that he was racing that week as well and we spent you know, half an hour chatting as well. And I don't know. I mean, we all tried to persuade him. And I think ultimately, I think Lawrence and as I said, his vision, the new factory and what Aston Martin wants for the future, together with Honda as well, were probably key factors listening to what Adrian said yesterday. I don't think so. I would like to say yes, but honestly, I don't think so. March ‘25, I think the focus for most of the teams will be ‘26 projects and the change of regulations. You start in March, until you know everybody, and you take you place in the factories it’s April or May. And I don't think that it's really worth spending too much in the ‘25 campaign, unless you are fighting for the championship… I hope we have a nice surprise, but I doubt it. So I think the ‘26 project should be the first car that he has an influence. Let's see. I think every race, it seems a little bit different. At the midfield, everything is so tight that one or two tenths can make a huge difference, and hopefully Baku is one of those positive weekends for us. Last year, it was a Sprint event, so we only had FP1, and it was a little bit difficult for everybody. Hopefully now with free practices, we can fine tune the car and let's see. No idea. Good question. We see maybe less than the onboard camera shows sometimes. I think we are sitting on a lower position. And yeah, we focus so much on things quite far away that maybe doesn't seem that obvious from outside. The car is very fast, obviously, and you approach things at a very fast rate. So we are looking sometimes 300 metres, 400 metres away from us, because in two tenths of a second, we will be there. So that's the focus we have, and for that kind of vision, I think we see enough from the car. Obviously, we don't see things that are close to us. Even the start box on Sunday is difficult for us. Pit stops are a little bit of a guess as well, because we don't have the exact point of where the front wing stands or the tyres sometimes. But yeah, I think it's not very, very important, visibility in Formula 1. Sometimes the less you see, faster you are! Let's see. We cannot predict the future, but as I said before, I think we have quite good things coming in the next few months in the team, especially the wind tunnel. I would say that is a gamechanger for us. We are using now Mercedes wind tunnel and obviously limited on time, limited when in the week they allowed us to go there and things. So I think to have our own wind tunnel and use, you know, wisely during the week, you know, in the moments that are needed, I think that will be a huge step forward. And I think the factory as well, you know, we cannot forget Aston Martin two years ago, still on a very small building from Racing Point, Force India. And now, you know, we double the personnel and we have this new facility. So, you know, step by step, we have all to have that first race win and hopefully fighting for championships in the future. I'm aware that this takes time and I don't have that time in a way. So, but, you know, I'm relaxed and I'm enjoying the journey. I think we all will agree that motor sport is extremely expensive right now, not only from the top categories. I think karting became a little bit too much, you know, 200,000, 250,000 for a season in karting now, it seems not logical starting point for any motor sport enthusiast. So, yeah. It's not an easy fix. And I don't know how it could be policed in a way. But yeah, I think we are all concerned about that. I will be driving in 2026. After ’26… I will be driving! Or in Formula 1 or in other series. If I'm not driving in Formula 1, I will be in the Aston Martin team, somehow. So I will enjoy that bright future, hopefully. After, I will be driving! Yeah, why not? I mean, the Valkyrie programme for Le Mans is taking shape as well. Making the debut next year. And yeah, who knows, maybe in ‘27, ‘28, ’29! Yeah, I think, yeah, same comments. Maybe a casualty more than, you know, any chains that have been made. Maybe this weekend we recover all of those. Let's see. He's an incredible talent and a very humble person as well, which I think that's the biggest thing that we need to work on. He's a hard worker, apart from his talent, and I think that's why in Formula 3 and Formula 2 had this much progress. I think also he's someone that is taking things very seriously as well, which at that age is never a guarantee. As we touched before on the budgets and things like that, he won the championship as a rookie in Formula 3, and he's fighting for the championship as a rookie in Formula 2, but without the test of many other rookies. So he's probably the only rookie, rookie on the championship. So this was an amazing achievement so far. And let's see what the future brings. But, you know, it's a matter of time that he gets to F1.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Aston Martin
Daniel Ricciardo,"I don't think I could give much advice to the most experienced guy on the grid. But look, obviously I enjoyed... I've spoken it before. I enjoyed a lot of my time with him. And it was just even a privilege, when I joined Red Bull Racing in 2014, just to drive one of his cars, work alongside him. Obviously, his level of expertise in his field and, you know, I would normally just feed back things. It's not that I could stand toe to toe with him and speak his language, if you know what I mean. But it was just to try and obviously collaborate in those years and collaborate. give what I could and then let him obviously work his magic. That was just a very, very cool experience, you know, walking past the office, seeing the drawings and everything. I mean, it's not for show. He's there with pen on paper and yeah, just very, I'd say very unique, but very special way of working. And yeah, from that, it was just obviously a pleasure and a privilege. And obviously I don't need to give Fernando any advice, but I'm sure it'll be a enjoyable experience. Yeah, so I'm looking forward to that. I’m looking forward to driving here again. You know, I didn't do this one last year, so it's another circuit that I'm, yeah, just keen for. It's a race as well that can throw anything up in the mix. So it's one where I think, especially us, maybe in that midfield battle, it's one where we can hold on to maybe some optimism that you can get maybe a bit of a special result on a circuit like this, and as the race plays out as it normally does. So yeah, look, first and foremost, the updates, try and get those going tomorrow, get into the circuit, kind of feel it again, and hopefully we're in a good spot then by Sunday afternoon. Yeah, I think Fernando touched on a lot of the points. I think, naturally, the speeds we go, yes, we are always looking ahead. And it's kind of the way you piece the lap together as well. By the time you get to one corner, you're already looking at the next and setting the car up for the next. So you don't necessarily need to see what's immediately in front of you, you know, two, five metres in front of you. Some situations it does. It is, yeah, tricky. And Fernando touched on a very simple one, but lining up in the grid box at the start, we actually don't see, obviously we see the grid box maybe when it's, I don't know, 10 metres in front of us, five or so, five, 10 metres. But then when we get close, it's just a judge. We're just trying to guess where it is. So some simple things are actually quite difficult. And it has become a bit more difficult, I would say, with this style car. So the bigger tyres, the ride height, the car is a bit more flat. Therefore, it's kind of as if the nose is lifted. So then... yeah with the ride height that you know kind of lifts us up from the rear and we're looking down more. this is now flatter. So yeah, we lose probably another little bit in front of us. um but yeah it's as I say it's more the little things. I think at speed either you don't it doesn't matter too much or we're just used to it, but yeah, grid box, pit stops some little things can be tricky. And then, yeah, I mean, the mirrors, we do the best with what we got, but naturally there are some blind spots at times. But then, yeah, we use our judgment and spatial awareness the best way we can. But yeah, I think what's overwhelming probably to some is if they were to just sit in the car, I think they'll be like, how do you see? Because you're so used to seeing everything around you and you simply don't. So that in itself… I remember when I went from go-karts to a Formula car, that was the biggest difficulty was just... trying to know, okay, whereabouts is the kerb? I don't see the kerb, so I have to figure out from a feeling, and yeah, that stuff takes a bit to get used to. Also, I wasn't dodging the other question. I think they just, they answered it well on the funding stuff. On the, yeah, I think the Safety Car thing… I didn't know that to be honest. I could answer it simply by saying, yeah, just coincidence. And I don't know if it's the track layouts. I mean, there has been… like Monza, there were some incidents and a bit of contact here and there. Sometimes it's also just the way it goes. Sometimes contact can be brushed off and other times it isn't. I know from a viewing point of view, sometimes obviously a Safety Car mid-race spices it up. But when we're in the race and we're out there, we're just trying to do what we can and get our head down. So if you happen to see a Safety Car at some point, you know, you adjust accordingly. But yeah, I didn't even know. If you said there was a Safety Car two races ago, I would have said, oh yeah, I believe you.",Azerbaijan,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, it is true. I mean, yeah, it was a very special six months working with him, you know. Very similar comments to Daniel. Obviously, he got the chance to work for a much longer time, but he's one of the most successful car designers in our sport. And he's got a very unique way of approaching racing, approaching design, because similar to Daniel, I would walk in the factory and see him in front of his board, drawing all sorts of stuff, which I could not even tell what was really going on there but ultimately, it just seems to work when it gets to the track. Very humble person, which I liked on a personal level. I always had great talks with him and always accessible, which was very enjoyable for the time we were working together. You're being tough! You're being tough, because Zandvoort was actually really good for us. We were top of the midfield. Last race was definitely more disappointing and more difficult in Monza, which we knew. Historically it doesn't really suit our package and objectively Baku is another one where last year was also very tough. We're coming with an humble approach. We have a similar car than we had in Monza and we know on paper It doesn't look like an easy weekend, but as Daniel said, it's one of these races where everything can happen, can be thrown in a good spot at any moment, and hopefully we'll be able to capitalise any opportunities that open up. Yeah, I think it's definitely a talking point because over the last eight years, I think the price already doubled. So when I'm hearing what the price is in Formula 2 compared to where they were before, and you are talking about 2 million plus, without any guarantee you're going to make it to a professional level and be able to live off the sport. So completely agree that is something we've got to address. The number of races has increased. Prices have increased. But it's giving less chances to some potential talents that won't have the funding. And I agree with Fernando. It starts already from karting. I don't know, around me, many people that can pay that much for a 10 or 11-year-old kid. And hopefully, as a sport, I think we're all aware of it. I think it's a question of taking the right actions. I think we are doing a lot of improvements. with integrity, diversity, et cetera, but definitely need a step in that direction in cost reduction to give more opportunities to more kids. Because even on a personal level, I had very good friends in karting who were very talented and ultimately stopped after Formula 4 because they could not afford the prices moving up. So yeah, hopefully as a sport, we can tackle that issue. I think it's obviously historic to the team. It's a tricky topic. I think ultimately the decision goes to the top management on what's the right decision for the team moving forward but obviously there is an important part of history and you know experience and legacy from their work in our sport. It’s just been messing up with our stats, because before every race, we were like, there is this much probability of a Safety Car. So we kind of try to predict for it sometimes when the pace is not great and hoping that there is a Safety Car. But sadly, it didn't come, apparently, the last seven races. But I guess we are all well-behaved and well-raced. Well, I'm still getting to know Ollie. Obviously he's been coming in a few weeks ago and It's a big change, obviously a big factory, leading over a thousand people and obviously on a personal level I'm in touch with him quite consistently, as a driver, trying to feed him back the good information for us to improve and get better. But for now it's been everything good and I'm sure he's finding his feet in the team and we seem to get on with it in the right way.",Azerbaijan,thursday,Alpine
Lando Norris,"Of course, because he got passed. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what I should have done differently there. If I brake one metre later, I probably would have crashed. So, something we'll look at. But, I mean, Ferrari just drove a better race today, especially Charles. He did a very good job, so just hats off to him. I mean we considered it the whole race, but it was not possible with the amount of graining that I had. It's a tough one. We knew it'd be tight, but with our car and some of the limitations we have it wasn't possible today, so we knew it. We knew that could be a possibility. So, we’re disappointed of course, but yeah, Ferrari did a better job. They had a better car today, and that's hats off to them. Well done to him. He did a good job. He got past me, and he deserves it. Pretty disappointing. Yeah, which is obvious from the outside even. I mean, Charles drove a great race, honestly. Hard to know if we could have done what he did today, but they deserved it. Yeah, both Oscar and Charles drove a good race. So, yeah, disappointing, starting from pole and ending third, especially when I think the pace was very strong. So, a shame, but that's what it is. I mean, we tried, we knew it was a quicker thing to do, but I think, yeah, we just killed the tyres a little bit too easily. And like Oscar said, when you're in third, it's a much easier position to just try and risk and do such a thing. So I don't think we can be too disappointed. I think it was a lot riskier for us to try and do it than it was for Charles, and he made it work. So, yeah, hats off to them and Ferrari and himself because the driving part makes a big difference out there. We thought of it and we wanted to do it. We just we couldn't today. I think it was clear yesterday. We had a good qualifying car. But today our race car was probably not quite good enough. When I boxed for the second time. Just don't crash, that's all. Yeah, there was no contact, so he did a good job. It's the same answer every single weekend. I'm doing the best I can, and the more points I gain, the better, but still eight races to go. I have help. Yeah, he helps me. But I'm not here just to beg for someone to let me pass. That's not why I'm here. I'm here to race. He drove a better race than me, so I finished third, and that's where I deserved to finish. I mean, I would love it, but it's not what… It's not up to me. It's tough, because obviously I think as any driver, you don't want it. You know you don't want things to just be played that way. It's a tough one. Obviously, I wouldn't say we're running out of time, but time is going away slowly, and I still believe I still believe we can do it. The pace is obviously great. I still believe we're probably close to, if not the best car again today. I don't know. It's not for me to decide. It's for the team, but I think we're still working together well. We're still helping one another and I think that showed plenty of times this year that we're working together very well as a team and we're performing as the best team out on the grid and we're very happy with that. But yeah, I don't know. When you're fighting for a championship, you want every little thing and I'm doing everything I can. The best way simply is just to win the race. And I didn't do that today because of some silly things. So, yeah, this is for the team, not for me. Just brake a bit later. Simple as that. But sometimes it's easier said than done. You know, Oscar obviously braked on the limit and gave me space. It was just about enough. I did my best to avoid anything else happening at the time. But at the same time, if I brake two metres later, you don't know and you can't predict. But two metres later and it could easily have been a crash. So it's a tough one. Easiest thing is just to brake way later and force him off and I kind of treat it like no one else. I don't know. I obviously took it easy. I saw we had a massive gap behind, so maybe I was just a bit too much on the cautious side and paid the price. No. I mean, they didn't have any pace. So therefore, it wasn't a surprise, no. I was on much fresher tyres, you know, like 10, 15 laps or something. No, I mean, it was expected, I think, at that point. Maybe even more, 20 laps of difference. So, yeah, they seem to struggle with some things this weekend, but they'll be fine next weekend.",Italy,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it hurts. I'm not going to lie, it hurts a lot. We did a lot of things right today, you know, there were a lot of question marks on the strategy going into the race. Yeah, from the position we were in with the tyres looking like they did, doing a one-stop seemed like a very risky call, and in the end it was right. So, yeah, very, very happy with the pace, with the race that I managed to achieve. Just when you finish second, it hurts. In hindsight, yes. But, you know, everyone's a legend on Monday after the race or, you know, at the chequered flag. And today, unfortunately, we got it a bit wrong. And, you know, myself being a big part of that, we had everything to lose from being in the lead of the race. Charles could try something a bit different. He was going to finish third either way. And, yeah, he picked the right gamble today. You know, the Mediums were getting destroyed. And even the Hards and the Red Bull at the start looked pretty dead. And my front left was pretty heavily grained. Just we didn't expect it to clear back up again, which it did. So, yeah, painful. Clearly not as seriously as I needed to. I think, for me, it was a big risk to do that. You know, the graining of the tyres has been a big topic all weekend. You know, in practice, once you got graining, it was basically game over. Even in the first stint on the Mediums, it was pretty difficult. And, yeah, when we made the second stop, for myself, my front left tyre was pretty heavily grained and, you know, I was going slower and slower. So it seemed like a sensible decision to pit again. Yeah, you know, I guess nobody really expected the graining to clear up on Charles, from what I heard. So yeah, in hindsight, clearly stopping once was the right thing to do. But from that point in the race with all the information that we'd gathered through the weekend, it seemed incredibly risky and. You know, that's kind of the blessing and the curse of leading the race or, you know, being at the front, full stop. You know, the guys behind you can react to what you do. And, you know, for Charles, if he did a two-stop, he would have locked in third. And if he did a one-stop and fell off the cliff, he still would have finished third. But, of course, he pulled the one-stop off and Ferrari look like the hero today. Yeah, obviously it hurts at the moment, but I think in the moment it was the right thing to do. Not massively I don't think. I need to go back and look at what the graining level on Charles was when I pitted for the second time. Up until that point it was you know a pretty controlled race. We felt pretty early on that it was a two-stop race and maybe in hindsight, there are things we could have done a bit differently from obviously a strategy point of view, but also a driving point of view to keep the options open a little bit more. But if the information I got is right, on the radio, then it wasn't really a matter of driving slower. It was just kind of sticking with the graining and getting through it, which given in practice when that happened you basically couldn't hit the brake pedal because you turned your front left into a 50 cent coin, it seemed like a very risky thing to do so. Obviously, it was the right thing in hindsight but everyone's a lot smarter when the chequered flag falls. I mean, I braked later and got around the outside. There wasn't really much more to it than that. Yeah, you know, we both got through unscathed. I knew once I hit the brakes, you know, I kind of got ahead a bit and yeah, I knew I was kind of entitled to stay on the outside. And yeah, ultimately, for 38 laps of that race, it put me in a race-winning position. So yeah, for me, it was just a good first lap. I think very. We’ve closed over 100 points. So, yeah, pretty happy with how we're going. I mean, I asked basically straight away what pace I needed to do to go and get Charles. And the pace I needed was basically what I did for the first few laps. And at that point, I was pretty optimistic. You know, I lost a decent amount of time behind Carlos. You had Stroll driving like it was his first go-kart race and I don't know what went through his brain when he saw his blue flag. That cost another second. And, yeah, you know, I needed that stint to be perfect to win that race. And, you know, those little things are ultimately what cost us a bit of a chance. It would have been a long shot anyway, but, yeah. It was certainly not far off from being able to achieve it. But yeah, I was pushing flat out to try and do it. I couldn't have gone any faster than that. So yep, just came up a bit short.",Italy,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"It's an incredible feeling. Actually, I thought that the first time would just feel like this, and then the second time, if there was a second time, wouldn't feel as special. But, my God, the emotions in the last few laps, exactly the same, like in 2019, just watching the grandstand inside of the track. which is tricky but yeah, incredible! I mean Monaco and Monza are the two races that I want to win every year. Obviously I want to win as many races as possible and the world championship as soon as possible but these are the two most important races of the season and I managed to win them this year. So, it's so, so special. Yes, the fans are incredible. [Spoken in Italian] I said in English before, the first time was really special, the first year in Ferrari in 2019 was a dream for me. I thought that if there was a second time it wouldn't be so special because the first one is always more unique, but that wasn't true. It's always so special and this is thanks to you for the support, the push you give us every day when we come here. Thank you, thank you very much for everything. I don't know. I don't know because I think our package was working pretty well on a track like Monza. Whether it will be the same for the rest of these of the season I doubt, so I still think McLaren are the favourites but we have done a step forward that's for sure and Baku is a pretty nice track for me. I quite like this track and I've been quite competitive in the past, so who knows maybe we can achieve something special again there. Just as sweet as the 2019 one. I thought the first one was always going to be more special if there was a second one ever happening, but actually it's not the case. The second one just feels as special. Today I did not expect it going to the race. I thought that we would struggle a bit more compared to the McLaren, but also compared to the Mercedes. that seemed to have a really good pace on Friday. However, after a few laps, I saw and I felt the car was in a good place. Oscar maybe was a little bit quicker. It was difficult to see Lando's pace as he was behind. Then once we got undercut, I was like, OK, maybe we are losing the win there. But then once both pitted, I actually picked up quite a lot of front grip, having the free air in front. And I was, as they said, being the last car, I didn't have much to lose by trying the one-stop. But we did a really, really good job with that front left, which has been very, very tricky for everybody. We had a lot of front graining, but managed to take that front grip again. And that helped us to win today. To stand up on that podium in front of all the tifosi after such a week, because it's a very tiring one… It's an incredible feeling to be racing for Ferrari in Monza, but it's also very tiring. And to be able to win here is extremely special. Before the race, if you would have asked me, the one-stop was definitely the thing I wanted to do. After 10 laps, I think we saw that Red Bull started to struggle with the front left on the Hard. And there we started to doubt the one-stop. We thought that it would be a lot more difficult because we thought that the Hard would be a more difficult tyre to bring to the end. However, as soon as I put it, I still thought that this was a possibility. And especially, I think, when Oscar pitted two or three laps after that. I felt like I had more grip not having a car in front, especially on the front tyres, and that's where I really thought that the one-stop, we could make it work. We've got to be cautious. After Monaco, I think we've had the four worst races of the season, because Monaco was so specific to our car at that time. Monza is also a very specific and particular track. Lots of straights, not many corners. We had a rear wing for this track as well, which helped us to win today. We had also another upgrade, which I think definitely brought us closer to McLaren, but I don't think it's enough to be the car to beat for the rest of the season on other tracks. I think we still have a lot of work to do, but I'm really happy anyway to have one here in Italy. Well, I mean, we had really good top speed and that definitely helps on a track like this. So I guess that's how it helped us. I honestly haven't checked on everybody's rear wing, whether everybody has brought something special for here. But yeah, it definitely helped us to win today as the characteristics were good and the balance of the car was also pretty good with that wing. All in all, from FP1, we didn't change much the car. The car felt good. In qualifying, we struggled a little bit with the tires, but in the race, we were in a really good place. So, yeah, the whole package was strong this weekend. Yeah, two very different tracks. But it feels good to be winning on those two tracks. That for sure means more, Monaco as a Monegasque and here as a Ferrari driver. So yeah, both are a very, very special feeling and I wouldn't want to choose in between them, as the two are very, very special. I completely forgot the second part of your question. Yeah, Indianapolis is... I mean, I'm really interested in doing Le Mans one day. Indianapolis is not something that I've been particularly looking at. However, maybe one day. But Le Mans is definitely one of those races that I would like to compete in one day. So, yeah. I don't know when, but hopefully soon. Good question. To be honest, I think we'll have waited maybe one or two laps more just to see. I felt like maybe in the last two, three laps before Oscar pitted we were coming back a tiny bit, but I've got to check that again. But it was difficult for me to get closer than where I was, mostly because of the front left and the understeer that being behind Oscar… I had quite a bit too much understeer. So maybe we'll have gone for a second stop and be a bit more aggressive to try and come back towards the end. But yeah, I don't know. We didn't do that anyway. Again, before this race, I don't think I was seeing myself challenging for wins anywhere else. Maybe Singapore. Singapore maybe could be a strong track for us. On the other tracks, I still feel like we are a step behind McLaren and Red Bull. But today we've seen that we can be very on a par with McLaren if we do everything perfect. Again, I think that the upgrade has helped us in some ways today to have the same pace as them. However, for the other tracks, I don't know whether it will be enough to completely close the gap, especially the gap we've seen in the previous races, not here. So, yeah, we've got to wait and see, but we've done some step forward. I think we need some others. No, I'm not superstitious and I will never be. I think as an athlete that's the last thing you want to be, because I have always felt like it's conditioning me mentally, if then you forget something and I obviously don't choose the colour of the overalls. So if I start asking for a black overall for the rest of the season I'm not sure the tifosi will be very happy with that. So, yeah, no, I don't have any superstitions. We won in Monaco, we were in red. We won here, we were in black. I don't think we plan on using anything other than red for the rest of the season, and hopefully it will be a successful red, just like in Monaco. Just like in 2019, the last 3, 4, 5 laps it was quite difficult to keep the eyes on the track and I was obviously looking a little bit in the grandstand, I could see everybody was standing up and that was really nice to see. In 2019 I remember there was my mum also in the grandstand because I didn't manage to have a paddock pass for her. This year, she actually had a paddock pass, so it's good. She could watch and experience both things, once in the grandstand and once in the paddock. But yeah, it's a very special feeling. I could also see some red smoke at one point. So I knew everybody was super excited, but I also knew that I had to finish the job and that I had to stay on it because Oscar had a really good pace. But yeah, in the last five, six laps, I felt like we had it. The tyres felt good and I could see that Oscar was not that fast to catch me before the end of the race if I was not doing any mistakes. I think more than me personally, yes, there's a little bit more expectations, which translates in a bit more pressure coming into the weekend. However, I think as drivers, we are quite used to it, so it's fine to deal with it. But I think more for the whole team there are lots of expectations for most of the team members. They all have at least one family member or very close friend in the grandstand and that adds a lot to it. Everybody wants to do super well in Italy, lots of Italians traveling from all over Italy just to see Ferrari and to cheer for us. So you also want to do well for the big support we have here, and that adds a little bit to the pressure. And then, other than that, we have so many events and things we've got to do from the Monday in Milan to the Sunday. That is quite tiring. So to manage all these things is not easy but once again in 2019 we did a great job managing that and this year we did a really good job managing that as well. But that's also what makes winning in Monza so special. It's also because all of this and especially because of the crazy support we have here. The only thing I was focusing on really was my front left. I could see there was a little bit of graining, and I really didn't want it to get worse. Otherwise, I knew that this was what will make me lose this race. So that was my only focus for the last… Actually, from when I put the Hard on the car. Yeah, that was my only focus. I knew that it was critical to not open this graining too much. And we did a really good job. Again, as soon as I had free air, I could change a little bit the balance of the car and put more stress on the rear tyres, which was exactly what I wanted to do. And as soon as that balance changed, I felt like the pace was coming back. Well, again, I think we shouldn't, and I've said that after Monaco, and I think we did that, we shouldn't rely on the race we have just done. And as a team, it's really important for us that once we come back at the factory tomorrow, we reset from everything that has happened during the weekend. We learn from it and we try to analyse everything, but we should leave emotions aside. and reset as a team and go again in Baku, not having crazy high expectations because that's not where the team is at the moment. I repeat myself, but Monza is a very specific track. We have been very strong this weekend, but Baku will be maybe very different and Singapore again very different. So we've got to reset. We did that reset from Monaco to Montreal, but as we've seen from Monaco to Montreal, it was a really big change from one weekend to another. And then we went through three or four of the worst races of the season, just because we were trying to understand what was going on in our car. So hopefully we don't go through three or four very difficult races from now on, and I don't think it will be the case. But again, it's very important that not only the team, but I think also the expectations from outside don't become crazy high from one race to another because this is not realistic. Have we done a step forward? Yes. Is it enough to go and win races until the end of the season? I don't think so yet, but we did a good step in the right direction.",Italy,post-race,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, the first lap in Q3 was quite good. Just the second one, not quite enough, which I feel like I've said a few too many times this year. So, no, still a good performance and a really good team effort. You know, I think the field's been incredibly tight this weekend. So, I think I said on the radio, you know, there was no guarantee of a front-row lockout for us. So, yeah, an amazing effort to be able to pull that off. Yeah, I mean starting a bit further up the front than last week is definitely a positive for myself. It's obviously a long run down to Turn 1. So, starting second here is not always the worst thing but yeah, let's see what the tyres do tomorrow. It's been a little bit different to what we're used to in Monza. So, yeah, it could be a pretty exciting race, and with such a tight field at the front I think it will be very exciting. I think the car was very strong. The first lap I did in Q3 was solid. A couple of little things to work on, but, yeah, the second lap just wasn't as good as it needed to be, really. A similar story in Turn 1, really, and that kind of set the tone for the rest of my lap. Had a big wheel spin out of Turn 1, and it was a bit of a mess from there. Yeah, I just need to tidy it up a little bit at the end. But the car was performing well. I don't think, after practice, it certainly wasn't guaranteed to have this result. I think we very easily felt like we could have ended up, you know, seventh or eighth if we didn't get it quite right. So to come away on the front row is a very good result for the team. Not so much to keep them alive. Just the tarmac has been quite difficult to judge. It's had a lot of rain or dirt on it. You know, when you watch the TV shots in some of the corners, it's basically two black lines from where we've been driving and the rest is kind of brown. So it's made life a little bit difficult and it's quite a… just a difficult tarmac for whatever reason to drive on and also for the tyres. We've seen a lot of graining throughout practice so it's been difficult. I don't think it's necessarily been the temperature but it's yeah been very, very tough I think for everybody to nail a lap this weekend, even with all these attempts in qualifying I don't think anyone or I certainly don't feel like I have. And the last time you two were on the front row together in Hungary, it wasn't the smoothest race for the team, although you did win it, Oscar. Just what do you see as the key moments tomorrow? Where are your best opportunities to beat Lando? I  mean, I think you know the start is always a good opportunity. It's a long run to Turn 1 here. Obviously we, as a team, we need to do a bit of a better job than last week unless we plan on getting bad starts and just creating a roadblock. That is an opportunity but there will be more opportunities tomorrow. I think, you know, it will… The strategy is still a bit of a question mark. No one's done really more than 10 laps on a set of tyres. So it'll be interesting to see what happens. So I think it'll be a pretty interesting one, even after the first lap. I've actually not seen it yet, to be honest, so I need to go check it with the team and see what happens. Yeah, not much to add, really. I think the baseline of the car was really kind of set earlier in the year and we've just been able to gradually improve it a bit. And yeah, it certainly wasn't the same kind of upgrade that vaulted us up the order last year or earlier this year. It's a really small thing, so I think just the underlying performance of the car is very strong. But when the field is so tight like it is at the moment, every little bit counts, like Lando said. Yeah, I mean, I think in Imola there were a few stories of some of us getting a little bit of stick, but it's fun. It's not serious hate, like what we see sometimes. I think for myself, you know, I always love coming to race in Italy. You know, as Lando said, I think they're probably the most passionate fans we have all year. I mean, my last name is Italian, so I think some of them consider me one of their own a little bit. So it's always fun coming back here and for me Monza is one of the best races of the year. I mean, he seemed very quick yesterday in FP1. Obviously, his session didn't last that long, but the laps he did seemed very competitive. You know, he's been very competitive in the junior categories as well. I know it's been a bit of a tougher year for him in F2, but I think it's been a tough year by Prema’s standard. Yeah I think he will definitely be competitive. Obviously he's very young um but Mercedes have clearly put him into you know a race-winning car for a reason and I'm sure he'll be a yeah a great competitor next year. I mean, in my personal experience, I think of it very, very little. I think if you're consciously thinking about the dangers of the sport, then you're not giving your full attention to trying to drive fast and trying to win. So, I think as soon as that starts to creep in, it's obviously not a great sign. I think when events like that happen, where, you know, tragic accidents happen, of course, in the moment, it's very, very difficult to not think about it. And unfortunately, we have had a few major accidents in the last five years or so. Yeah, certainly going racing the next day is a bit different than it is most other days. But I think once the helmet goes on and we're out on track, we're always concentrated on trying to get the most out of the race in front of us. And the fear very quickly goes away. Yeah, we've discussed it a bit already, and we will discuss it again tomorrow, I'm sure. Yeah, don't really have any more to add. No. I mean, I think you always want to try and keep some kind of toe. In the end, there weren't any tactics between us two. We kind of ended up in the middle of the pack. So I think I was behind Lando. But yeah, you know, we're kind of all getting a toe off each other. So just free to try and get our own space and get our own gap.",Italy,post-qualifying,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, it was great ending up P3. A little bit better than I expected because it was a really tough session, Q1 and Q2, and fortunately we saved it until the end, not too far behind the McLarens. They're so fast at the moment and we're working so hard to catch them up, but I'm super happy with third. I think it's going to be a tight battle. Everybody's so close out there. So exciting for F1. We've all been waiting for this competition and knowing that if you do a great job, you've got a chance of victory. So I'm pretty pumped for tomorrow. Get some nice pizza tonight to fuel me up and a bit of extra a bit of extra weight, so not too light tomorrow and hopefully we can fight for a good result looking forward for it. Yeah, it was a very up and down weekend, obviously. Missed a lot yesterday, which put me really on the back foot and had to make a lot of changes from FP3 into qualifying because that was really my first proper session out on track. And Q1 and Q2 was really, really messy. I wasn't confident, didn't feel good in the car and just sort of scraped through the session. And then suddenly I managed to get it in the sweet spot for Q3. Both my laps, I think I was third or fourth,. and obviously ended up third. So pretty pleased with that result and it's kind of exciting to see how close it is with everyone. Yeah, it feels good around here. Last week, I think we recognise where we went wrong with the set-up and you know in this sport it runs away from you really, really quickly if you're just on the wrong side of that sweet spot and that's absolutely what we found in in Zandvoort. As painful as it is, it's important sometimes to have those disappointing weekends. There's no guarantees for tomorrow. You know, we weren't a million miles away in qualifying in Zandvoort, but I am confident we'll be more in the mix tomorrow and try and keep up with these guys. I mean, I don't really know what to expect because I've just not really done the laps, to be honest. So I'll just have to trust my instincts and go from there, really, and adapt on the fly. So as I said, I'm really, really pleased to be lining up P3 after the day we've had, and the car definitely seems to have potential. If they make a start like last week, then we've got a chance, I think. But if they have a good start, then I think it'll be very difficult. You know, McLaren have done an incredible job these recent races, they are the team to beat. Seemingly, everywhere we go, they've been the quickest, and that's probably been the case since... As long as I can remember, really. I've got a short memory, but it seems like a long time. Nothing more to add. Yeah, I mean, obviously we've lost quite a few parts. Fingers crossed Lewis and I don't do any further damage, otherwise we'll have to revert back to some of the old parts, unless we can get some new pieces made in the interim. It's not the end of the world as long as we both don't do any further damage. As it stands, we don't have any spares of our upgraded stuff.",Italy,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Yeah, thank you. I mean another pole, which is amazing. Like Oscar said, to have two cars first and second when the field has been as tight as it has all weekend it's a little bit of a surprise but a nice one. So, big well done to the team. They did an amazing job. Honestly, my lap was... It hurts me to say, but it was not a great lap. My Q3 run one was, but run two was a little bit more, and we're still getting a pole. So a little bit surprised again, but very, very happy. Yeah, the same. Really, the same would be lovely, but like we've seen all weekend, it's so close. There's a lot of very quick drivers behind, in quick cars, so I'm not expecting a very easy race tomorrow. And like George said, a lot of unknown things going into the race with the degradation, the tyres, the tarmac, you know, so plenty of question marks and plenty of excitement, I'm sure. I mean, it's always a little daunting, you know, on a quality lap especially. You don't know how much to push. But it's a fun one. The whole circuit's amazing, and I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Very, because I think it's probably been, like everyone's seen, the closest build-up, FP1, FP2, FP3… I think we just looked as good as the others, nothing more, nothing less, honestly. So yeah, just expected a tough qualifying, and it was, for sure. But I think for us to come away with a 1-2, to come away with another pole, was probably not quite what we were expecting, but in a good way, of course. Yeah, a good qualifying, I wouldn't say the cleanest. Just difficult to put laps together around here, and when the margins are so small, you try and go for everything, but you can also pay a price, you know? So risk-reward in a lot of corners. But I think the risk that we had through it and the set-up changes and things we made into qualifying seemed to have made a good amount of progress, and we seem very quick. It's tough to say. I think we just continued to progress. Not a lot. My first lap in quali was already a 19.8, which was a great first lap out of the box. It wasn't like I went out and found big chunks. It wasn't like Zandvoort, where I went three, four tenths quicker and that kind of evolution. But there are a lot less corners around here, and it's trickier to put it together, I think. Just small things with the car, like you don't get to FP3 and then quali and change the whole thing or turn it upside down. You're nudging it in different directions and just trying to make a car in which you're comfortable to execute good laps on. I feel like we made a bit of progress with that. But also maybe with fuel and things like that, when you bring it down, the car just seemed to come a little bit more alive come qualifying. Definitely seemed to progress ahead of some of the others. It just didn't feel like a nailed lap. I think all of us, as drivers, when we go out in quali, you just want to put together a perfect lap. You want everything to flow. I tried pushing the braking a bit more for one, and I actually got one so much better. I then smashed the inside kerb of Turn 2, because I turned in too early. So I was about tenth and a half down just after Turn 1. So I was kind of like, ‘eek, it's over already before it even starts’. And I didn't really expect to gain it. But then I nailed the second chicane and gained one and a half tenths back straight away. And then just made a couple of hundredths of a gain in every corner from that point on. So it just didn't feel like a nailed lap. It didn't feel as good as my lap last weekend, but clearly still good enough for pole, which is a nice feeling. Honestly, I think when you look back to Zandvoort, you could say yes. There's enough evidence that led us to believe we could have a very, very strong race. Here, less so, just because it's been so close, but we're still first and second, which means we have a good car, and that normally translates well into a good race car. But I think tomorrow there are more question marks with, you know, graining and degradation and things like that. You know, everyone's 4-1-2 with tyres and probably a little bit more nervous of what can happen and what might happen. But we're in the best position for it. So excited to see what we can do. What we learned? I mean, a couple of things. For sure, we of course reviewed things like we always do. And I feel like we've made progress so far with our practice launches and stuff like that. So, yeah, just crack on and do our best. Not much. Simple way of putting it. For sure, every little counts. And we've definitely been taking some smaller steps forward. But some of the upgrades we had have been track specific. The rear wing that we had, which was the main part of the upgrade last weekend, we don't have it again here. So it's not like what worked perfectly well there, works here. So we had that, but we also had the rear wing again this weekend. So specific things, but it's not like it revolutionised the car or made the car feel like it's a lot better. It's just a bit more efficient. Smaller things, but those smaller things really, they make big differences in the end. If you have one or two smaller snaps over a single lap, you can gain half a tenth, one tenth quite quickly because the tyres are in a better condition, the temperature's less, and things like that. They've definitely helped. I think less than maybe what people expected, like a lot of parts, but nothing which was like, now we're going to be three tenths quicker all of a sudden, you know? So, steps forward. But we need more still, as well as we're doing. We need more. We believe we can do more. And I think, you know, when you go to our debriefs and stuff, there's plenty of stuff that Oscar and I complain about and still would like to be improved. And we're working hard to continue to try and do that. Yeah, for sure. It's a good opportunity. I mean, I expect him to come through and probably be behind us quite quickly. Their race pace looked very strong on Friday. They were on the better side of the graining and the degradation, so I expect them to probably be a bit more hopeful tomorrow. For some reason, they just didn't seem to take those steps forward through qualifying. He still seemed quick, like in Q2 he was right there and ended up quicker than me, even on a used tyre. And even his gap to Pérez wasn't as big as what it normally is. So I don't know if he just struggled more with something or just didn't put good enough laps in, but... Yeah, it'll be for a reason, I'm sure. And yeah, we need to try and make the most of that. No. I mean, I'm sure Ferrari fans want Ferrari to win. But yeah, I don't know. I don't know who their second favorites are. But I think there's a lot of supporters. I feel like I have a lot of support from the Italians and from the Ferrari fans. So I've always loved that. I've always appreciated it. And yeah, sometimes it's good to disappoint. Yeah, I think they're always a lot of fun and passionate no matter what. And I think they're great fans, probably some of the best in the world, most passionate in the world. So I don't think any of us would think like that. A lot of the same, honestly. I mean, he's going to be in Formula 1 because he's probably good enough to be there, and Toto sees a lot in him. So he's proven himself a lot in the junior categories and coming up through. I think it's a big jump to go from F4 to F2. Yes, it's a big jump, so it's not probably been easy on him, but to go from F2 and then straight to F1, it's a lot. So I'm sure it will be a steep learning curve for him, steeper than probably what most of us have ever had, which always comes with pressure and things like that. So as long as he copes with that well, I'm sure, you know, learning from one of the best here as his teammate, then I'm sure he'll be up to speed in no time. I'm not. It helps. It's a great thing. You're always trying to do your best and the higher you are, normally the better you're doing. So it's always rewarding, but it's... If I wasn't on pole today, you know, and Mercedes were first or Red Bull were first, it's also not the end of the world. And you can only do the best you can on every day. And today, again, to show that we could be first and second was a great thing. But everything's important at the minute, for me. Every point, every position is crucial. And that's the way we have to work until the end of the season. But kind of like we covered last weekend, it's not like I have to do this and I have to do that. There's no desperation, there's no need for things, but it's always going to help and make my life easier the higher up I am. So of course it's rewarding, it's a great thing. It makes me happy in the end of the day knowing that we're on pole and we have this kind of momentum. And it's not just a good thing for me, honestly, because I don't think I think of it too much, but more for my team, for the mechanics, the engineers, everyone back in the factory, i's just constant motivation and boosts for them to know we've come a long way, we've done a lot of work, and we still have plenty more to go. That's our Sunday morning meeting. It's a little bit, it's been discussed already, but at the minute it's free to race, like it always is. Nothing more to add. But also, yeah, it depends what you're comfortable on. Some people will be closer, some people further away. Also, you know, with even Q3, I had two cars ahead, Albon and the Haas, I think. So just avoiding yellow flags and things like that. Not because I think they would have caused them, but some people have higher chance of causing yellow flags than others. And just thinking of even of those things to kind of a big gap just to give that little bit more time in case someone locks up in one or there's a yellow flag for some silly reason. So a little bit of that. We were quick on our own. Even when we compare us this year to last year, we're like 20kph or something quicker in the straights. It's a lot. Last year, we were pretty shocking in the straight, which came as a bit of a surprise, but it shows the difference of when you're not prepared to when you're prepared for a race, where we were last year to where we are now.",Italy,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Quite the opposite. No, I just went back home and had dinner and went to bed. So not very exciting at all. But it was, yeah, it's just a good feeling. And that's the most important thing. Not a lot. It doesn't. I mean, Monza’s a very different track, so... Yeah, I mean, it gives the team a good amount of confidence and always a little bit of a boost, but it doesn't change your feeling. We know we've been performing well the whole year since Miami. We've been doing a very good job, and this was a weekend where everything just went perfectly. They have been since the beginning. Like, I don't know, it's not something you can just question now. I think I answered it in every single interview I did last week so I'm not going answer in every single interview from now on, but we're pushing hard every weekend. Of course our goal is to catch in both, and especially from a constructor side, it looks a lot more doable than the driver's side. But I'm doing my best, the team's doing their best, and that's all we can hope for. Tough to say. I mean, if you kind of compare it a little bit more to Spa, probably, I think we were still pretty good there. Obviously, Red Bull were very quick there, but Red Bull have always been very good in Spa specifically. Here it’s a bit of a question mark. It was probably one of our worst races last year, mainly because I just sat behind Alex the whole race. It was genuinely one of our trickier races that we did last year. So we're not expecting to be probably as good as we were last weekend, that's for sure. We always knew we were going to be very good in Zandvoort, but yeah, a weekend where we're expecting good competition with all of our competitors. Well, I think there are nine races to go still. So I think definitely the momentum is with them. But we're not sitting back. We as a team are working really hard to find the solutions. I think it has been a really good step taken to understand the issue. It has taken us probably a little bit too long, but we know what are our problems. maximising from now until the end of the year and see where we end up. But I got every hope that we can bring some performance to the car in the coming races. I guess I just wish him the best. I'm sure it's not an easy thing. I think the main thing is he knows the track, he knows the car. It's just like external pressure, but I think he's a guy who can probably deal with it very well. I think the more difficult part of coming in mid-season is just we're on top of everything. We know how the tyres work, how everything works, and we're able to predict everything. For him, it's the complete opposite almost. He's going to go into certain times in qualifying and races just not being able to pre-empt what's going to happen with the tyres. When they get to this temperature, what's going to happen? How then do you have to drive? We're prepared for... for everything and every step of the way. And for him, that's going to be the tough part. But he's here for a reason because he's talented and he's a very good kid. And I'm sure he'll do just fine. Probably not as much as you think. And I think because I struggled a lot with this when I started in Formula 1. Like my first, second year and into my third. Because I struggled with it so much back then, I feel like I learned pretty well how to handle it. And that's also helped me even in the position that I am now. I know I'm maybe not directly in the fight of a championship where I'm neck and neck with Max, but just dealing with more questions and the pressure of everyone thinking that I have to deliver every single weekend, also knowing myself that I have to deliver every single weekend. But I think because I struggled a bit with it or quite a bit with it in the past, I feel like I'm able to deal with it in a much better way now. And therefore, it doesn't have much of an effect. There still is. And I know there's more pressure. The team are probably going to feel a little bit more pressure. And externally, there will be more pressure on me. But it's also up to me to deal with it in the way that I feel best. And at the same time, therefore, I don't really feel it that much. I'm comfortable that I just have to go out and drive. That's all I can do really, not think about these external things. The place I am now, fighting for wins and fighting in the Championship, honestly I feel like it's another weekend. I don't think of it at all. I think there's always pressure, which is the main, like, you know, I still get so nervous for qualifying. You know, for the races, I still get just as excited and just as nervous. You know, I don't eat, I barely eat anything on Sundays. I struggle to drink anything on Sundays, just because of nerves and just because of pressure. But I think just how you turn that into a positive thing, you know, how can you make that, how do you not let it affect you in a bad way and how can you actually use it in a good way to help you focus on the correct things and so on. But I'm sure I do now and probably will forever, you know, when you enter Q3 or any qualifying lap when you have to go out and deliver. I know it gives you butterflies every time because there's so much nerve, so much pressure. And if you do one thing, break centimetres or a metre too late or you turn in the wrong timing or whatever it is, finished, game over. And the knowledge of that just puts you under a very tense feeling. But also, it's an amazing feeling at the same time that I don't feel like maybe you can replicate in many other sports and many other things. I'm not too sure. I still get nervous, and I probably will forever get nervous. I mean, I've smiled more since last weekend, for sure, but... You know, like, a lot of the questions... Like, for me, a win is incredible and is generally, I think, one of the best feelings you can have, because this is what I dreamed of and this is all I wanted to achieve. But as much as I really do not think of the championship at all, for me, it's just one race at a time. So you can see it in a positive way and a negative way that the only thing I care about now is this weekend. I couldn't care less about next weekend or the weekend after or whatever. It's just what can I do today? What can I do tomorrow? What can I do Saturday and Sunday? That's just how I live. That's my process of life. But the same flips when it's post-weekend. I won the race. We won the race. Sunday night, I just went out for dinner with my friend. My car broke down. We had to push the car all the way back home. It couldn’t have ended in the worst way, but it was just a back to normality kind of thing. And I kind of forget about it. By the time I'm on Monday, Yeah, I was just back to training and then thinking, OK, that's one race done. That's part one of, what, ten or nine. And you kind of have to just forget about it and focus on the next time out, and that's this weekend. So I use it in a good way for me, but it's one race at a time, and I don't think of this kind of longer-term stuff that much. Yeah, good question. I think it's evident, and I feel within myself, I feel like I have changed a lot since I've come into Formula 1. I don't know whether people want to say it's in good ways or bad ways or whatever. I think in the end of the day, the main thing is I'm still myself. I'm happy to disappoint people and give my own opinion, whether it's right or wrong sometimes. I almost cared, I think, too much when I came into Formula 1, and not in a bad way, but just I cared almost more about other people's opinions and thoughts rather than just doing my own stuff and cracking on and being myself. Not that I ever wanted to be someone different or do something different, but I just feel like over time and with pressure with focus on doing the job I have to do, I just found better balances of life and I probably enjoy my time away from the track more now. Probably in a different way to what I did back then, but the best way is just a better balance of life, whether I'm here working and I'm focused on doing what I want to do, which is win and to do the best job I can for my team. And the balance of going home and being able to disconnect and just enjoy my personal life and days at home where I can relax and do something else. And I know that'll change. And I feel like when I see pictures and I see videos of who I was and what I did, even 2019, 2020, 21, I do look at myself and see things and I'm like, oh, I was very different back then to how I am now. But at the end of the day, my focus and my job that I'm here to do has remained the same. So whether I laugh more or laugh less or make jokes more or less, that's just how I've changed over the years. But I still love what I do, otherwise I wouldn't be here. And I still enjoy my time, but I think just in different ways. I get to share it more with my team. And I just learned how to treat Formula 1 and my job more as a focus and learn how to then switch off in a better way when I go back home. I mean, there are ways around things. There'll be some days when I can happily eat a bit more, and there'll be other days where I just can't do much at all. Of course, fluids is generally one of the best ways of getting things in. So normally in the morning, I can drink a fair bit, and I can easily mix my drinks with certain carbohydrates and drinks to get some longer-term energy in. But also, I don't drink ever during a race. I often don't run with a drinks bottle. I think I've drunk from my water bottle twice ever in Formula 1. And both those times when I've just been very ill, like in Barcelona a couple of years ago, and I think in other times. I don't do any fluids while driving, and it's probably not the best. And often, I try and force myself to try drink just for concentration and for fluids. Even in Zandvoort last week, I lost two kilos through the race. which is a bit of a surprise, but it's still a physical track. And I was pushing the whole way. and yes, two kilos of liquids, you know, and because I don't drink anything back, it's probably not the best thing for me, especially towards the end of the race. So I do try and do it. I just really struggle to and often just forget and don't like drinking during the race. But there's other ways around of just making sure I have good energy with bars and certain drinks that I can have small amounts of, but of high concentration. And nerves. No, I don't think I've ever gone to the extreme, and I've never really struggled so much. Yeah. I've never been sick or anything, as oftentimes I probably feel it. But that's probably as bad as I think it's got, which is, I think, normal for when it's your first time on a pole or your first time leading races. You feel different things than what you felt before. But honestly, I've never been that bad.",Italy,thursday,McLaren
Sergio Pérez,"Well, I think what they've shown in Zandvoort was really, really strong. I think it's been the strongest performance we've seen from McLaren in a while. At the same time, I think we have every hope to believe that Zandvoort is probably a really bad track for us in regards to the wind, that we suffer more than others. We'll see. We come to a very different track and we expect them to be still the benchmark. Hopefully we can get closer and be in the mix in the race. The biggest thing for us is that we understand now the issues with the car. We understand them. It's just a question of how quickly and what solutions we have to fix them. But we exactly know where we are with the car. We know what is the issue. And hopefully in the coming weekends, even already for this one, we are able to make a lot of progress. I think understanding the issue did help a lot because I think after Miami we were a bit in limbo and we were working with a car that we didn't understand what was going on with it. And I think once you understand the issue you are able to set up around it, to drive around it. And I think that made a bit of a difference in my side. But now the most important is to be able to fix the issue. Yeah, Woody. I think, you know, obviously Hugh has been there since I joined Red Bull. And with Woody, he was my performance engineer, he’s stepping up for now. And yeah, you can see that it's a little bit different, the communication and the way they see things. Everyone has their perception. But I think it's working well. And I just expect Woody to ramp up and get better every single weekend, and at the same time, wishing the best to Hugh and his family. I think it's a massive challenge, definitely. But obviously, when you get the opportunity, you have to go for it. I think he's been with Williams for quite a while. Now I think it will really speed up his learning. Now that he will be racing, he will see what Alex is doing, how the team works during a weekend. And that will open his mind so much to whatever he does next. I think he will be a much prepared driver in the future. So I will just recommend him to enjoy his opportunity, enjoy the moment, and maximize the chance. No, I'll wait for tomorrow. I know that the kerbs have changed, the grip has changed. I did my sim session beforehand and it was with the old layout. So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see and also to see if it changes the approach as well, you know, with the downforce. It might push you to go for less now that there is a little bit more grip. So I think it will be interesting also to see what it does with the tyres. I think the solution is the same for both cars because Max can probably cope with the problem a little bit better with his child than I can. But ultimately, once we are able to solve it, it's going to benefit a lot both for drivers. It might benefit me even more on my side. I think the correlation issue, we've had it for a while and it's there within a lot of teams. I wouldn't think that that's the main problem. The main problem is that we probably took a wrong direction somewhere that we have to understand it. From there on, just try and bring the performance to the car in the right path, in the right way to make those big jumps.",Italy,thursday,Red Bull
Alex Albon,"I don't think we really were able to show anything. We were stuck behind cars in the first stint. We tried to box early and then got covered off by other cars. So then we were stuck again in the second stint and that was kind of our race. As you said, a missed opportunity. I felt like we could have scored points last week. Yeah, obviously something to review. We need to understand the processes that went on to be disqualified. Obviously it was very unintentional and the car was still good on Sunday with all the changes. So yeah, it's a bit frustrating to miss out. In terms of balance, not really anything to say. Just a bit more load. All the numbers came back positive. They were up, so that's nice. I think we're more in the mix with the midfield. It's still close and we would need a bit more to get in front of everyone. This is part of a double package, so we're waiting for a second part of it a bit later into the season, and hopefully that will just tie up some of the balance problems as well, because we're not just missing load, we're missing a bit of balance as well. Yeah, I don't think we have the same car in terms of the same peaks as we did last year. Zandvoort, we were the second slowest car down the straights, so we just need to bear in mind where our car is. I think we'll be okay. I think we'll be in the fight for points, obviously on the lower end, maybe not sixth, but let's give it a go. I think we've got a decent car. Yeah, I'm kind of focused on my own lane, so obviously more than anything, I know Logan personally. He's a super guy and things didn't work out but I'm sure whatever he gets on and moves on to do, he's going to be very good. I know the pace he has and at the same time, of course, Franco is now joining, so there's a bit of a learning curve for him, but I think he's coming at the right moment. If I could choose a track to do my first race at, I think Monza is one of the more forgiving ones, better than Baku or Singapore. I think in some ways it's a nice thing that he's got, in my opinion. He knows the seat's not up for grabs next year. There's no pressure in terms of having to deliver and not trying to get a seat for next year. In some ways, I think it's more just a bit of experience. I don't know what Franco's going to do next year, but the things you learn in F1 can help you a lot into, let's say, if he does another year in Formula 2 next year. enjoy it. and of course there is a bit of a learning curve but he's been in the car a couple times already so I don't think it will be such a big thing. maybe more about the physicality. when we go to Qatar and Singapore. that would be a bit of a surprise I think or not surprise but a difficult thing to get used to. But yeah, I think also Williams are great at educating and teaching the drivers how to get the most out of it. So also, I think I'll try and help him as much as I can as well. Yeah, clearly it was quite a late decision, so I didn't hear so long before the announcement. Obviously, yes, I did speak with Logan, but I'll keep that behind closed doors. You know, great guy, and we got on very well. I think he's got a bright future ahead of him. And yeah, you know, I feel for him, for sure. But yeah, I'll leave it like that. Yeah, I mean, I've seen it. I feel like it's maybe lost a bit of its character. I feel like some of the kerbs they've put in are a little bit more generic. And I think generally Monza had quite a specific style of track. It was quite bumpy, but that's not a bad thing. And the kerbs were quite unique. Let's see how it goes. I think there's going to be a lot of exploring in FP1 and FP2. I think with these kerbs, if you can use them or not and how much you can use them will be a big question mark. But yeah, let's see. Thanks. Yeah, I feel like Singapore's, I think for everyone… Well, Qatar's kind of overtaken it, at least in my opinion, in terms of physicality. But it's a tough one. I've started my heat chamber sessions last week to get ready for Singapore. And it's always one of the ones where in January, February, when we're training, we're pretty much training for these two or three races in the calendar that really take it out of you. What will be tough is obviously we're also moving quite a bit in terms of distances, Baku to Singapore, which is going to be quite challenging as well just for the body and the rest and the mind and everything like that. So yeah, I remember, as you said, having my appendicitis. Maybe if I did it again, I'm not sure I would have done it. But it was a good challenge to myself. I proved to myself that I can do it still. But I did crash that race as well. But yeah, it was a good challenge. Tough.",Italy,thursday,Williams
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, I don't let the last two races change our expectations. We are in a difficult moment for the team. We are struggling a little bit with pace at the moment. I think we understood quite a few things since Zandvoort, especially on what happened on Saturday, where our performance was quite far from ideal. But on the Sunday, it was a good race. In Spa it was good as well. Here, it should be a bit more in the direction of Spa, so hopefully we'll be a bit more in the fight for the podium. However, for the win, I don't think we quite have that yet. I think we are in a better position than on a higher downforce track. So it should be a bit better. How much better, it's still to be seen. We'll also have some upgrades on the car which should go in the right direction. So hopefully when we put everything together, we are closer than where we were in the last few races. Let's say that there were very specific characteristics of the car that we had to improve. I'm not going to go too much into details, and this where those upgrades should help us. Then we'll see, because I don't think Monza is the best track to judge those upgrades. Probably Baku or Singapore will be more of a test for us, but it should go in the right direction anyway. But by how much, I don't know yet. I don't think Lewis needs any kind of advice, but it's definitely very, very special to be, driving for Ferrari in Monza and in Italy. There's something that is iconic and it's such a special feeling, the amount of support we have. We obviously have it everywhere in the world, but whenever we are in Italy, it's extra special. It's difficult to get in and out of the hotel every morning and every evening but it's a very special feeling and we have so much support so it's motivating us at the maximum. But Lewis will be experiencing that next year and we'll experience that together and I'm sure it will be a special year. but until then we've got to maximise and hopefully put the car a bit higher up in the standings. I wouldn't say the feeling is that we must do better. However, there's definitely a huge motivation because it's not only a normal weekend that starts from the Thursday to the Sunday, but it starts already from Monday in Maranello where we have so many tifosi and that obviously motivates everybody. It seems and it looks like we've had a pretty strong car with a very low-downforce package even in the last few years where performance was not as good. So that's positive because it's our home race and as much as it's giving exactly the same amount of points as other races, emotionally speaking and for the whole team it's definitely a special one. So it's really important for everybody to do well. However, we are not doing anything different to perform better at this track. It just happened that our low downforce package in the last few years was pretty good. And whenever we came here, we were on the good side of our performances. Again, it's crazy. It's such a special feeling because you can really see and feel the passion of the tifosi and all the people that are traveling to Monza for Ferrari, how much it means for them to actually be here, see us dressed in red. Not this weekend because I'm in black this weekend! But however, even to see the mechanics or engineers the tifosi are so happy and they are not only supporting the drivers but obviously they are supporting Ferrari as a whole and every team members. It's a special experience for everybody within the team. so it's a very, very special weekend. It's a tiring week and that's where it's important to keep your energy for the Sunday but let's say it's positive energy and you get a lot of support. And yeah, as I said, from the Monday to the Sunday, it's just a very special week. Yeah, I think as drivers, we cannot really complain. We travel in the best in the best possible way. We stay in great hotels and we also have a programme that is fitted for an athlete. So we try and go to sleep relatively early and sleep as much as possible. And everything is done for our well-being. However, for the mechanics, for the engineers, sometimes there's a lot of work. They get to the track much earlier, they leave the track much later. And so it's a lot more difficult. And also to just have a normal life outside of racing, it's very difficult. So it's definitely needed. But as a driver, I can't complain. But I will say that 24 races is probably the maximum or at least the sweet spot. More than that will be too much. Viene in Ferrari? As saints. Yeah, I saw that one. Yeah, I agree. It's difficult to judge for now. The tarmac, ultimately, you get at one point where you've got to renew the tarmac. So it's not like there's the choice of just keeping the same tarmac for years and years and years. Because at one point, you just get too bumpy. And especially with our Formula 1 cars and the way they are run so low, the tracks have to renew that. So on that, I'm fine. On the kerbs, it's true that some tracks have the historic kerbs. And even if they renew it, I think in Canada it was done this year where they keep exactly the same shape, which this is nice. But I haven't tried yet the new kerbs. So maybe they feel even better compared to the old ones. But this I'll be able to tell you on each more. Not really. Actually, it's quite the opposite. Whenever I get to a special race like Monaco or Monza, you just try to do exactly the same thing as what you normally do on a normal race weekend, just to be in the same state of mind. not condition yourself doing anything differently. So that's my target is to just approach it like a normal weekend and to maximize the results just like we try to do every races. So yeah, that's it. Then of course there are a lot more things we've got to do tonight until very late. I'm in Milan for events which are things that you've got to manage as a driver. But apart from that, I just try to approach it as a normal race you can.",Italy,thursday,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"Hi, everyone. I'm not going to lie it definitely does feel a little bit different. I mean it always feels special when you come here. We're coming here at a decent time in terms of the weather's incredible today obviously the huge changes that made to the track. But as Charles was saying there's always such incredible passion with throughout Italy just in the culture in general but particularly about racing and It's always exciting just to see the fans that we're going to see throughout the weekend. The passion here and the excitement that they really bring to this race is really not particularly matched in too many places. It wasn't that it was a shock. We just struggled to get the balance in the perfect window. And I think you could see with these cars today, I mean, particularly with our car, but I think many teams experience it. It's kind of on a knife edge and can easily go one way or the other. In hindsight, we look back on some things and we would have done things slightly differently. Actual pace wise? I would think I was the third fastest on average through the race. Our race pace wasn't terrible and the results didn't show the true performance in the race but qualifying needed to be a bit better. I'm definitely more hopeful coming into this weekend that the car will be nicer to drive again. But you've got others that are bringing upgrades this weekend. So you have to expect Ferrari going to be quick with their upgrade. You have to expect that McLaren, with the advantage in the last lap that he was able to pull out in the last race, they're going to be rapid this weekend. So I'm just hopeful that we're there or thereabouts. Well, I mean, I said a long time ago that I think that's who the team should choose moving forwards. And time will tell what they end up deciding to do. No, he's one of those young, super-talented kids that's come through. I mean, he's a young adult now. But, yeah, he's only 18. So I think... I think it'd be good for people just to remember he is just turning 18, and he's got a bright future ahead of him. And yeah, I'm really excited to see and watch his progress. I saw a picture earlier on of us, back in, I think, 2018, and he was one of the grid kids! And I'm like shaking his hand at the front of the grid! So it obviously reminds you how old you are when you have those experiences. But yeah, looking forward to seeing his growth and his journey through into Formula 1. I think it's… We've been watching him through the through the different formulas and naturally he's a Mercedes driver. I just think we are starting to see a lot younger drivers coming through and I think we're just in that time, where there's only 20 seats and I think it's time. We're starting to see this new wave come through. In terms of taking on a another driver that's had many, many years of experience as opposed to giving an opportunity to a youngster. That's what McLaren did for me and it worked out well. In my opinion, it's just an opportunity for him to grow. He's going to get to work… He would get to work with the best in class, learn from people that I've worked with for so many, many years. But it is a lot of weight on someone's shoulders. But as I said, it's a great environment that I think they would just be able to nurture him and carry him through it. But there are other really good options. So you'd have to ask Toto which one he's leaning towards. I mean, I don't know what to expect. If I'm honest, the last couple of years, I mean, over the last few years, I've had a really warm welcome every time I've come, to be honest. There was one time when we were really fighting against Ferrari. I can't remember what year that was, but even then, people were positive. There was never any negativity. I think over the past few years, I've heard ‘viene Ferrari’? How do you say come to Ferrari? Viene in Ferrari. Yeah. So I heard that quite a lot. And so it'll be interesting to see how that is this year. But already in Imola, for example, I got a really warm reception. And there was this amazing picture of me, you, and Fred. Did you see it? I mean, we'll find out tomorrow. It's definitely always good having more input. Yeah, I think for Kimi tomorrow, I think it's just about enjoying yourself and having fun. This is going to be an amazing experience for him tomorrow. He's obviously already tested the old car, but tomorrow is going to be the first time he's, I believe, tested the new car, which is so much nicer than the 2022 car. So he's going to be all smiles tomorrow for sure. It's a drastic difference. And yeah, the more information and the more input we get, the better. So I don't know what to expect, what he's going to come back with, but we'll definitely take it in. I don't want to judge it before I've driven it. Maybe we'll get in and it'll be the greatest thing and greatest changes ever. So I don't want to shoot myself in the foot with that. Ultimately, we loved it before. For years, it's been super bumpy in so many places and That's been a huge part of the character of what this track is. The kerbs as well. that have been pretty much the same for definitely over 20 years, I would imagine. So it is a big, big change. But ultimately, it's still the same track. But yeah, we won't know until tomorrow. It's going to be a lot smoother, it looks, and probably quite a bit quicker. Honestly, I'm super excited. Every year having coming here and when you're on the podium and seeing the tifosi all the way down to Turn 1. And throughout the world, to be honest, it's definitely, again, I don't know really what to expect, but I'm really looking forward to connecting with that community and being on the journey with them as we work towards taking the team forwards. My Italian is definitely not very good. It's probably the same as it was when I was in karting, which was pretty bad. I've had some people that have asked me to sign Ferrari caps and I've been like: ‘no, no, it's too early. It's too soon.’ They're trying to get ahead of the curve. But I have signed some caps, obviously. And yeah, I mean, we're always talking about the kit and I'm always looking at the progress that they're making through the year in terms of the image, where they've been, and it's an incredible history they've had. I mean, there's a lot of points on the table, so I think it's not impossible. I think ultimately Max probably only needs to finish second every race to win at this point, and he [Norris] would have to win every single race and that still wouldn't be enough. So there'll need to be some fortune in it. I do think, and what's really exciting, I think there's a real chance that McLaren could win the Constructors' title. And I think that's really, really exciting because obviously I was there when we did win the last Constructors’. Obviously it got taken away from us, but we won it in terms of performance that year. I don't think they've won since, so I think that could be really exciting, I think, not only for them, but also for the sport. And, yeah, I hope that it goes down to the wire, because I think that would be great for the fans. But, yeah, with their performance they showed last weekend, maybe they could. I mean, I think that's a really good question. I think like anything, there is an element of you being used to it. So when we accelerate down to Turn 1 out of the pit lane, there's no fear there because it is part of what we do. But I don't know how it is for everyone else. But for me personally, when I get strapped in the first time and they start up the car, I get the same bubbly feeling inside. And then when everyone moves the tyre blankets away and you pull out into the pit lane and drive out into Turn 1 and just do your first lap, I mean, I always get a huge thrill. And there's so many moments that I still pinch myself that I still get to do this. It's really something I wish you could all feel and experience. But the cool thing… And it's probably why I'm still racing, is that it's not become such the norm that I don't feel it. If I was numb to it, that would really suck. And I'd probably be doing something else. But I'd have to fly fighter jets or something really low or something, I don't know, to come anywhere near close. Not at the moment, no. We had good deg in the last race. I mean, everyone, I think, thinks about it, but I don't think our deg was particularly bad in the last race and it was kind of warm. It's not currently a concern. We think the temp… Yeah, if it does get up there, then we'll deal with it. And I think the surface is going to be really interesting for us all to experience tomorrow.",Italy,thursday,Mercedes
Nico Hülkenberg,"Frankly, not super confident. Last year was a struggle here. This year, me and the car has been much, much better on a whole, on all type of circuits. But yeah, like you say, the last three races have been challenging. I think we didn't quite maximise our weekends on top of that in Spa. In particular, we weren't competitive enough here. So it's difficult to judge. I'd rather, you know, do some laps tomorrow and see how the package feels here. Yeah, it's all real. It happens. There is new asphalt, there's new kerbs. So we go out there and learn about them tomorrow and see, you know, how the tyres cope with it, how that might change, you know, some little details. Overall, obviously, the layout is the same, but yeah, all these other small things have been tweaked, but overall Monza, you know, one of my favourite events. It's an amazing atmosphere here. The D4Z, the energy is incredible. Yeah, look forward to the weekend ahead. Not just yet. You're a bit ahead of yourself! Well, obviously it's early days for him. He's just arrived at the team. So obviously he needs to make himself aware of the situation, get a picture of what's going on, understand all the departments, the people. And then I'm sure he has some ideas how to optimize it and take it a step further. So I guess that's the process that he's in now and he'll start working. to be honest, open subject. It’s a subject and a thing that's not in my power. I have no say, nothing to do with it. To be honest I'm open. I'd like to the best and strongest team-mate possible because I think you know you need two strong drivers. It's incredibly competitive in Formula 1, so it's important to have the best duo possible. Yeah, I think it's very important, these breaks. It's a demanding schedule, 24 races more than ever. We have triple headers, which are very tough on a lot of the team members that work long hours and are flat out pretty much for three weeks. summer break is important. We have another long break or longer break after Singapore. And personally, I feel this year, the schedule is a bit more balanced with more breaks. And I'm sure for team members involved that have the hardest jobs, that's really appreciated and it's positive. Yeah, same. I think we still, obviously, it's a process and, you know, especially in quali, you know, when you're on the limit, sometimes over the limit, you're playing with the limit, you just have to function, you have to do it all. But of course, As you go through the corner, you feel like, ‘OK, that was amazing, I nailed that’. That was perfect or not perfect. On the in-lap, you kind of have a little bit of time to process everything, get ready for the next run, and trying to optimize the next lap already. Yeah, like Louis says, you get used to some things. And it's our job. But obviously, it's still very thrilling and exciting and very, very special.",Italy,thursday,Haas
Max Verstappen,"Well, you always try to do better. I mean, we had a good start, so we tried everything we could today, but throughout the race, I think it was quite clear that we were not quick enough, so I tried to be second today. To be honest, not at all. I know that we have good starts, so I was quite confident that we would have another one, and luckily it was like that. And then, yeah, I just tried to do my own race, and that was my race, and I was second today. Yes, of course. I'd rather win today, but I can't win all of them. I'm always very happy with P2. I hope everyone enjoyed it. See you next year. The whole weekend has been the same. I mean, I had pretty much the same balance from FP1 all the way to the race. I mean, the limitations are the same. So yeah, it's just very hard to solve at the moment. Yeah, it just seems like we are too slow, but also quite bad on deg at the moment. That's a bit weird because I think the last few years normally we've been quite good on that. So something has been going wrong lately with the car that we need to understand and we need to, of course, quickly try to improve. It's just not a connected balance, front or rear. I don't think so. I think the start was all right. I had a bit of wheelspin as well. But I think Checo had a good start as well also on the left-hand side. So I think, yeah, we just got it right as a team probably also. And we have been doing quite well with that in most races this year. But it's also, I think, a bit more difficult to predict because the weather this weekend has been raining, drying, so you don't really get a consistent grip rate. So sometimes, yeah, it's a bit hit and miss. I was just doing my own race, looking after the tyres, I tried to do the best I could. But yeah, at one point, nothing was turning or responding anymore. So then Lando got quite close the first time, like he said, he was close, but not close enough. And then the next lap, there was nothing that I could do. So once he passed, I just focused on doing my race, tried to bring it to the end in second. I don't know. I mean, we just need to figure out our balance issues. I think that will already help a lot also with deg. Of course, in Monza, a lot is new. You know, tarmac, kerbs, even the layout in Turn 1, 2. So also that we need to understand a bit more. But, yeah, we know that we have quite a bit of work to do. I wasn't there in the first few races. But yeah, something in the car has made it more difficult to drive. And it's very hard to pinpoint where that is coming from at the moment. And yeah, that is then hurting, of course, our one lap performance, but also our long run. I think this weekend was just a bad weekend in general. So we need to understand that. But the last few races already, they haven't really been fantastic. So that, I think in a sense, was already a bit alarming. But we know that we don't need to panic. We are just trying to improve the situation. And that's what we are working on. But F1 is very complicated. Yeah, I mean, that happens, right? I mean, I've had a lot of good years. I mean, some people have never won a race in their career, you know, so you can also look at it like that. From my side, yeah, we at the moment don't have the fastest car. We have some issues that we have to solve and we are working on that. That's the only thing I can say about that. You know, we're very focused on it. There's still a lot of races left, a lot of different kind of tracks. This weekend was just not our best weekend.",Netherlands,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, very, very surprised. I'm not very often happy with a P3, but I think with today's race, we can be extremely happy with the job we've done on a difficult weekend for the team. We've been struggling from Friday until the race. In the race, we found some more pace, executed a perfect strategy, we undercut two of our competitors there, and then we managed to keep them behind. So a really strong race for the team, and yeah, really happy to start the second half like this. Yeah, also at the start, I knew it was a big opportunity. I didn't know that later on we would also have the pace to keep him behind. But I knew that the first lap was an opportunity for us to gain one or two positions. I went for the pass. It all worked well. But never would I have thought that I would stand on the podium after such a difficult race again for the team. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ah, that is a very good question. And I think the best question is also to understand why we were nine tenths off yesterday and suddenly pretty strong today. The car is exactly the same. Yesterday, we've been struggling like crazy. Today, we were strong. And these are the kind of things that we've got to work on. I think as much as we analyse every bad surprise we have during a season, we also need to understand when we do something good. For now, I don't think as a team we have the explanation. So it's a great result. I'm really happy to be standing on the podium. And I think it's a really good surprise. However, we've got to understand in order to perform more often at our best. It wasn't, because my engineer was telling me about Oscar's lap time, which when he was in free air was quite a bit quicker than me, I think nearly a second. Then when he got closer, I started to push a bit more and gain five tenths. And I think with the dirty air, he probably lost three or four tenths. He managed to stay behind and to put me quite under pressure for two, three laps, but then couldn't stay there because of the overheating. It was a really good strategy. I did not expect to keep that third place until the end, but we did a really good job as a team. I don't think there was anything more we could have done today. Again, it's very, very difficult to predict. If you will have asked me that question yesterday, I will have told you it will be very difficult. Today is much better. If we manage to understand what's going on with our car, then I'm quite optimistic about the future. But for now, we don't quite have the understanding yet. It's super important. I think we've had three or four races four races ago where we were experimenting quite a lot to try and understand what were the fundamental issues of our car for the development, medium-term. We've got an upgrade coming very soon. Now I can say actually because Fred said it, so it will be in Monza. And that, I hope, will help us and help us close the gap. But until the upgrades, I always said that the priority for us was just to do a damage limitation. And today, we were targeting P6. Realistically, I think on paper, that's what we were fighting for. However, after three, four laps, the pace was there. And we called do P3, which is a good surprise again. So good points. However, now I just hope that the upgrades helps us to do a step forward.",Netherlands,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Thanks. It feels amazing, yeah, once again. I wouldn't say a perfect race, because of lap one again, but afterwards it was beautiful. You know, the pace was very strong. The car was unbelievable today, so I could get comfortable, I could push and get past Max, which was the main thing, and just go from there. So, honestly, quite a straightforward race, still tough, but very enjoyable. Yeah, I mean, we have so many fans here, so it's beautiful. I mean, I have a lot of Dutch fans and Dutch supporters, so I thank you very much. I mean, I'm sure some are a little upset, but I hope it was a good race, and yeah, a lot of them supporting me, so I appreciate it a lot. Yeah, I mean, I think from quite early on, actually, from probably lap five, six, seven, I expected Max to start pushing and get a bit of a gap, and he never did. So from that point, I knew we were in with a good fight. But he seemed to just keep dropping off, and my pace was getting better. So it's a nice feeling inside the car, and especially when I got past, you know, I could just get comfortable, I could push, I had clean air, and that's always a big help. A win is always satisfying, so very good. Obviously, didn't start in the most optimistic way, but the pace was unbelievable from the beginning and I could go with Max quite happily at the start. I just didn't expect our pace to be probably as good as what it was today, which is a good thing. It's nice to be kind of a little bit surprised by this. And as soon as I got ahead, it was quite straightforward. I could push. I had good confidence to push the whole race, save the tyres a little bit, but just get in a good rhythm and go from there. So the car felt amazing. The car felt great and made my life easier for sure. So a big thanks to the team. I mean, this weekend a little bit. I still feel like we probably would have won without the upgrades this weekend. The upgrades didn't make us certainly a lot quicker here, you know, but the upgrades we've been putting on the car, they've helped us every time. It's not like we put it on and questioned it. We put it on and it was just… It did everything it wanted to do and needed to do and it wasn't meant to do. We've taken our time, and this was our first upgrade since Miami. Yes, we've had little bits along the way, but just like tweaks, it's nothing that's like his performance. And a lot of other people have. So we kind of fell down a little bit the order in terms of delivering parts and delivering upgrades, compared to all of our competition. And this was our first time we really put something on the car to drive us a step forward. And it definitely did that. But it's not like we've not been competitive over the last two months since Miami. You know, we've been quickest in Budapest. very quick at certain other races like Barcelona and Silverstone and stuff like that. But small things make a big difference. And today, with how the car felt, I'm sure it was a step ahead. You know, a new rear wing probably helped me get past Max today. So little things like that definitely help you go forwards. No, I mean, after yesterday, of course, we were confident the pace was going to be good, for sure. My long-run pace on Friday was very good, but you don't do anything more than, like, 10, 11 laps, and you never know in the 72-lap race what's going to happen. But I would say also Max's pace didn't look bad on Friday. You could already pick apart a bit of it and kind of give yourself some confidence, It wasn't like we came into here thinking, ‘yeah, we can easily just pass him on track’ and pull the gap that we did today. It's just not often that I've been in the lead and being able to control things and do what I want to do and look after the tyres and have clean air and stuff like that. And all of this makes a big difference in the end of the day. So I didn't expect things to go as well as it did. After getting done into Turn 1 and off the line, I was actually just surprisingly calm, maybe because I'm a bit used to going backwards at the start. I'm very prepared for those kind of scenarios. And I was very calm and just, ‘OK, well, what can I do now?’ And that was just to look ahead, start saving tyres, see what I had pace wise. But really even like lap 10, 11, 12, 13, I kind of managed to catch Max a little bit again and started to gain quite a bit of optimism that actually I could almost pass him on track. So I had two opportunities. The first one, I wasn't quite close enough. The next lap I did it and I could get my head down from there. Not get wheelspin. Obviously not, because otherwise I would have done better then. But I mean, we know what to do. We know what's required to do a perfect start. But we're talking about fine margins here. Because we both didn't get it right, it seems like maybe there was more underlying issue or something wasn't how it was supposed to be, or we've clearly misjudged something more than what others did. But Oscar's one of the best starters on the grid. I'm not as good as him, but there or thereabouts. I'm not a bad starter, but not as good as obviously what we need to be. Again, it was a race which almost slipped away off the line, but today was, again, different to every other thing that's happened. So, kind of like I said before the weekend, we need to find a bit more consistency, but we've worked on it and I feel like I've done better procedurally, but obviously didn't turn into the correct thing. I have no idea. You ask us questions like we're meant to know. I've got no idea. Yeah, anyone could be on top. Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull, us. Ferrari were quite quick today. We probably didn't expect them to be as good as they were. Maybe Red Bull struggled a bit more. I think that was probably more the factor that the Red Bull struggled a bit more today than we were expecting. We just keep our heads down. There's no point thinking how we're going to do next weekend. We'll just get there and work hard and wait till we get there. There's no point thinking ahead. I mean, I've been fighting for the championship since the first race of the year. There's no sudden decision of now. I need to do better. I've been working hard the whole year and I'm still 70 points behind Max. So it's pretty stupid to think of anything at the minute. I just take one race at a time and just keep doing what I'm doing now because there's no point to think ahead and think of the rest. I don't care about it at the minute. I'm just... Yeah, focused on one race at a time. So it's not a question that I need to get asked every single weekend. Oh, 100%, yeah. Today, this whole weekend, I think we've had the best car. I think we've, on average, had the best car, for sure. We've not had a dominant car at any point this season, I would say. Even if you go back to Hungary, as much as people hate me to say it, Max was still very quick in Hungary. He just didn't have a great race, but his pace was still very, very strong. And obviously we see, we know more information than people do on the outside, so we can comment in much more factual ways than people can who are just watching on TV and taking their picks and guesses. We've had, on average, the best car. You know, we probably should have won two, three more races as a team, but we didn't. And we're not saying anything more than that. You know, we should have won and we didn't, and it's because we've not done a good enough job. I didn't do a good enough job. And we worked hard over the summer break to just try and take a step back and reset and go again. So yes, we've had a great car. This was, like I said earlier, our first time we bought some good upgrades to the car since Miami. They worked very well then. They've worked once again now. Yeah, it's still a long way to go. So we still have to keep working hard because this is just Zandvoort. Monza is a completely different circuit. So we'll keep our heads down and keep chipping away.",Netherlands,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think the whole qualifying we just lacked a bit of pace. I tried the best I could. I'm still very happy, of course, to be on the front row. It's very tricky out there with the wind. I mean, you know, you have these gusts of wind coming in, so every single lap just feels different. So you can't really go off a reference as well. But yeah, I'm happy with second. I think after yesterday as well, this is a good result. Yeah, it's how it is at the moment. Not the easiest to drive, but the rest of the lap was quite solid. I think, yeah, only 11, 12 was a bit difficult. But yeah, we'll see. Hopefully the car is OK tomorrow in the race. We'll give it a good go. But of course, when you are more than three tenths behind in qualifying, I think we have to be realistic. You know, I just try to have a good race tomorrow. I don't know. I mean, I had a bit of a moment in 11-12, but that was also a bit my qualifying in general. I never really felt... Every run, there were always one or two corners where I felt like I was losing a lot of time with just the gust of wind. And it seemed like it was very sensitive for us. The car was really responding aggressively to it. And that's why I think every single run that I did it was different. I just had a different balance every time. Yeah, it just made it very difficult. Q3, I think the first lap wasn't too bad. Then I tried to push it a bit more, but everything just seems very snappy, very on the edge, I would say. But nevertheless, I mean, I'm happy to be on the front row. I think after Q1 and Q2, I mean, I've never really been in that top five region. Of course, I was trying to save tyres a bit because I only had four sets, but I never really felt that I was in the fight for pole. And then when you come out of qualifying on the front row, I think that's OK. I mean, I would hope so, but I think when you see the gap, it's going to be very tricky. Also, it just seems like Lando's a bit happier in general with just the driving and how he feels. I'm a bit more all over the place with the balance, so I don't know, maybe it stabilises a bit tomorrow, but I guess we'll find out. I don't know. I mean, anything can happen, right, in the race. So we'll find out. All right. Yeah, I must have been watching a different weekend. I don't know. I never felt close yesterday. I just try to do the best I can. Maybe I'm trying to stay with something that is not achievable for us, but I'm pushing to the limit like everyone else. Well, I don't know. I mean, it's three tenths here or whatever it was. I don't know what, of course, the upcoming races will be. But I think, yeah, if you look at the last, what, seven races, it's just been a bit more difficult for us. And we are trying to understand or try to just improve the situation. But it's not a magic button or switch, you know, that you turn. So, yeah, we keep trying. Lando is very, very fast. I think that's what you need to be. And that's why he's also in Formula 1, and that's why he's performing at the level that he's at. And it will only get better with experience as well, right? I mean, of course, I've been fighting for championships probably a bit longer, so you're probably a bit more experienced with that. But at the end of the day, when the team is working well, the car is working well, you're driving well, then it just comes to you as well. So, yeah, I never doubted that anyway. Which meeting? I don't remember. Yeah, he explained it very well. I do a lot of yoga and meditation lately (laughs). Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think Hungary was just a very frustrating weekend in general, but it doesn't always need to be like that. And I know that also. So I'm just trying as hard as I can, you know, to be competitive. I know the team does that as well, every single person within the team. So we, yeah, we stick together and try to improve the situation. No, I mean, everyone can say what they want. And I get on very well with Toto. I think he's very open about what's happening within his team, right? Also, I think with the driver line-up and stuff. So there's nothing wrong with that. And at the same time, also, I just focus on my job. There's a lot to do anyway. So, yeah, we just focus on that. Yeah, it was actually quite funny because he asked me if he could jump on my simulator quickly to do a few laps around Motegi. But unfortunately, I wasn't at home at the time. Otherwise, I would have set it up for him. But yeah, it's exciting. I mean, I've never driven the car myself, but they look amazing to drive. It's, of course, very, very different. And I think, of course, a big learning curve for him as well. But I'm looking forward to see how he does in the championship. He's a good friend of mine. He deserves it. And, yeah, wish him all the best.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I just didn't do a good enough job, really. I think the first half lap was pretty solid and then the second half just wasn't quite what I needed. So, yeah, clearly the car's been very quick this weekend and, yeah, a little bit disappointing to not be a bit higher up, but we've still got a good race car underneath us and we can get some really good points and hopefully some trophies tomorrow. So, yeah, we'll give it a try. Yeah, I think they're all doing what they expect, what we expect them to do. And yeah, anything you can put on the car, especially when it's as tight as it is, it's always a good thing. So yeah, not the easiest conditions to see what it's like, but as long as it makes the car quicker, then I'm happy. Yeah, I think it's definitely not out of the question. Yeah, the pace did look good in the long run. And yeah, we've been pretty quick the last few weekends. So hopefully we can have a good day tomorrow, get a good start and try and make up a couple of spots if I can. But yeah, some good things on offer tomorrow. I didn't crash like last year, so that was good! No, I think until the last lap, it was pretty good. Obviously, I think with the pace we had with the car today, I think P3 is not exactly a result to be jumping up and down about. But no, I think the rest of qualifying was pretty good. It all ran smoothly and I think a lot of those things were positive, just didn't quite nail it when I needed to at the end. So a bit disappointing there, but we've still got a lot of opportunities starting from where we are. No. I mean, to be honest, the car feels very, very similar. I think, you know, we've improved the car like a second and a half since last year or something crazy, and it doesn't feel that different. So I don't think it's anything to do with that. I think simply Lando did a good job in the last run of Q3, and I didn't do as good a job as I should have. So, yeah, I think it's just simply down to that. I think try and, of course, get a good start. That would be the first plan. And, yeah, strategy could be an interesting thing tomorrow. So we'll see. I think Max has got slightly different options to us. So, yeah, let's see what we've got. But I think we've got a very quick car underneath us, and hopefully we can use that on my side to go a bit further forward. I mean, if I can get myself into the lead, then that works well for me. But, yeah, I mean, I think the start is always a good opportunity to make up ground if you can. Yeah, obviously I want to finish as high as I can. And, yeah, if I can get into second, then obviously that makes life a little bit more straightforward for the team. But... I mean, I'm not going to do anything specific to try and make that happen. I want to try and win the race myself. And let's see what I can try and do. Yeah, the rules are very, very clear and haven't changed. And yeah, we're free to race each other to try and win. Of course, we're in a Constructors' Championship fight and we know that there's a lot at stake for the team. But we've shown time and time again that we can race each other well, race each other cleanly. And yeah, we're free to try and both win the race. And that's not changed.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Thank you. Yeah, an amazing day. Nice to be back and start with a pole. It was a nice lap. Honestly, the qualifying was always pretty smooth and put in some good laps, especially the one at the end, which is always the most important. So great job by the team and happy with today. It's harder than it looks, I think! I mean, everyone's complaining of it because it is tricky. It's not easy out there. And every lap, you have to kind of... know what to expect and know how much more you can push, where the limits are. But that's our job in the end of the day. So it's not easy, but I felt comfortable out there. The car was feeling amazing. We've got some upgrades on the car for the first time in a while and everything's working very well. So a big thanks to the team too. I don't know why you're saying that, but I'm excited for tomorrow. I'm sure it's going to be tough. Max has been quick all weekend. I know we got him today, but he's still second and he's going to be putting up a good fight, especially at his home race. So I'm looking forward to it. Both. I think both were good. I mean, especially my last lap in Quali Q3, Run 2 was by far my best lap. But I felt good all the way through qualifying, honestly. The car's been strong all weekend. We felt comfortable. We felt strong. And especially come today in qualifying, since the first lap we did, I felt like always in a good rhythm. and It's just not easy around here because it's not an easy track, first of all. But it's also even more difficult with the wind and the conditions and stuff. So just doing laps which are not mistake-free and not kind of locking up, not doing anything which would make me lose a little bit of confidence. And I just kept chipping away and improving every lap. So both were good, the car and I think myself too. Maybe a little bit, but it all depends on wind and conditions. You know, I feel like I did a very good lap, by far my best. But I think it's a track where when you just hook everything up and it just flows a little bit better. You catch a little bit of a headwind or a little bit less tailwind in certain places, you can easily go one, two tenths quicker. But I don't know if that's why or not. But the car was good and I felt good too. I mean, whenever you're going to bring upgrades to a car, and I think especially for us, we've been quite patient. We've not really brought many upgrades, or we haven't brought any real performance-enhancing upgrades since Miami. We brought always little bits, and there's always little things that we've added, but this is our first, let's say, upgrade. We took our time because we wanted to make sure it worked well and worked as soon as we put it on the car and it does what it wants. And so far it's looked exactly that way. So credits to the team for playing a big part in this too. I mean, there are always some unknowns. I think we're in a pretty reasonable place. Our long-run pace was pretty strong the other day, but Max, Oscar, both the Mercs, especially George, in the position he is, are quick and are going to be challenging. So I'm not expecting anything easy for sure. Tomorrow is going to look the most calm from a weather and a wind point of view, which is always a nicer thing to look forward to. I think we're in a good way, so hopefully we can continue what we had today into tomorrow. Nope. No, I had nothing in my hands. I just put a good lap in when I needed to, but I tried to do the best lap I could at every single point of qualifying. I didn't have anything spare come quali. But like they both said, it's a difficult day and they didn't do their best laps. I felt like I did a very strong lap. So today I just felt like I did the job I needed to go out and do, come qualifying. And for whatever reason, they struggled a bit more with their car, but it's not because I just had something in my hand. I know what you mean, but I didn't. Yes. I mean, it's obvious. I know my starts have not been my forte over the last probably... They've not been bad, honestly, I'm still up there with being one of the best average starters. I've just missed out on a couple of races and maybe slightly worse than what it's been over the course of a season. There's a couple of times when they've not been quite where they need to be have been a couple of times I've been on the front row. So like I said, they've not been for any certain reason. They've been different things each time. But I feel confident I put in a good amount of work to kind of try and make my starts a bit better. And tomorrow's a new day. Hello? No, the question was for Oscar. For both? Oscar said it well. We're free to race. There's never been any rules apart from don't crash into each other. That's literally the only rule. Otherwise, we've always been free to race. We've raced well in the past. So that's all good for us. No, not at the minute. I think we've always joked about it, but honestly, I've always had a lot of support from Dutch fans since I've started, since I've been in Formula 1. My mum's from Belgium, so it kind of puts me half into that bubble. So they've always supported me well, and I appreciate that. I always enjoy coming to a race like this, and the Red Bull Ring as well. They're kind of two home races for Max, with the amount of fans that he has there. So it's fun. It's nice that I have a lot of support from many different countries wherever I go. Some are more crazy than others, and I think the Dutch are one of the biggest players in this. But the more the merrier, and I appreciate that. Kind of any corner, which is 180 degrees, especially because the corners, Turn 1 is probably the best example. You have a big tailwind in and a big headwind out, so the car feels shocking on the way in and pretty lovely on the way out. So you kind of get both worlds, and then obviously you have the middle phase where the wind's blowing the side of the car, so you experience it there. And probably like 9 and 10, Turn 10 being the one where it's, what's probably felt the worst on the track the whole weekend. Again, simply going from like 20 kph tailwind in to 20 kph tailwind out. Vice versa, or similar to Turn 1, that you go in, the car doesn't respond, doesn't do anything you want. And it might not seem like 20, but when you see the numbers of the car in terms of kilograms of force, of downforce gained and lost, it's pretty extreme and probably more than what people realise on the outside. So everyone's dealing with the same thing, not just us three here, but everyone on the grid, and that's the challenge of what we have. You said the same words the other time. Yeah, I'm not desperate. I want to win, but I'm not desperate. I know you want that little headline right there, but I'm not going to give it to you. I want to win. I'm working hard to win. We all do as a team. All of us here want to win, but not desperate, because desperation doesn't succeed to anything. So it makes no difference. I'm trying very hard. And if you want to kind of put that into the headline, then that's fine. I had places to work on over the winter. I worked hard over the summer. I've worked hard on them. Little bits are paying off already, but tomorrow is obviously the biggest place of it all to show. So working hard for a win, but not desperate. Honestly, stats to me don't mean a lot. Yeah, I mean, you kind of get respect with stats and you lose respect maybe with certain stats, but just numbers on the screen, honestly, don't mean a lot from that perspective to me. Of course, I care, but they don't mean a lot. They don't impact me. So what people write and come up with and those kind of things are different. It's like the overtaking awards and stuff. You're always going to get more overtakes when you qualify terribly. You're going to have more chances to go forward. I've started on towards the front a lot of times. I know my stats are not the best for that. And more often than not, I've kind of gone backwards rather than holding positions. But that's just what I've done so far. And I've worked hard and working hard to try and change that. But it's not something that affects me. I'm not going to go out tomorrow to try and suddenly prove people wrong or something. I'm just going to crack on and do what I got to do. So yeah, people can write what they want. They can have their own opinions. A lot of these things are true and are facts to people. But yeah, it's more just use them to my advantage and improve on my weaknesses. Simple as that.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was very good. Spent a good time with friends and family. It was a lot of fun, honestly. I think it passed way too fast. If I could, I would have added another week, but that's how it goes. But it was good to refresh a bit, not really think about Formula 1, and just have a good time with funny people. To be honest, it's OK. I mean, just coming after the break as well, I always know, of course, that it's maybe a little bit more busy for me. But at the other hand, you just focus on performance. And yeah, just happy to be here. Also looking forward to the weekend itself. It looks like there's a bit of rain around as well, typically. But that's OK. I'm just excited to get started again. No. Nice and easy, yeah. So we passed halfway for sure, but it's been already, of course, an incredible ride. 200, yeah, I mean, it doesn't feel like 200, but of course we're doing a lot of races now in a year, so you add them quite quickly. Honestly, I think winning your very first race, that is always very emotional, because you dream of that when you're a little kid, to be on the podium in F1. And then being on the top step, I think, is always very special. Winning your first championship, these kind of things, yeah, they will always be something incredible that I will look back at after my career. Two highlights, yeah. Looking at how the season is at the moment, for sure. It looks like also there are many more teams involved that can actually win a race. So for sure, I'm not coming into this weekend saying that we're going to win the race. I just want to have a clean weekend, understand the car a bit more, learn from it. Of course, we analyse a lot over the break and try to do things maybe a bit different or better. And we'll find out, of course, over the weekend how that will go. I mean, of course, ‘28 is still very far away but in my mind at the moment, I'm not thinking about a new contract at the moment. I just want to see how it goes. Also see the new regulations first, you know, if it's fun or not. And then even in ‘26, ‘27, there's a lot of time to decide what happens. So I just keep everything open. But yeah, I'm quite easygoing about it. If you look at the championship, Lando is closest. But lately, you can see there are a lot of cars actually winning races and drivers, of course, of the team. So it's just very unknown. I mean, it's very close. And yeah, attention to detail and getting the car in the right operating window can really make a difference with so many teams and cars that close. So yeah, we'll see what happens. I mean, it's very difficult to comment on that right now. Kill your prey? I don't know. I mean, it's associated with the country as well, the lion. So I like that already. And I implemented that into my design with my logo as well on the top. And it worked out really well. And yeah, it just stayed on the helmet. And it's something that you grow into as well. Not at all, no. Can you do that again? Well, let's say like that. I never thought that that would happen when I started racing. But here we are. Honestly, I'm just happy to be here. It's always very special to have a home Grand Prix. Also, the track layout itself is really cool to drive, so I'm just enjoying the moment. It's of course also very enjoyable to see people happy and having a great time and just enjoying the weekend, so then it doesn't really matter about the songs or whatever. Not really. I mean, you just have to be realistic. If you can win the race, of course you go for it. If you don't have a chance, then it's very simple. You don't deserve to win. You move on and you try to do better. So for me, yeah, we just have to wait and see where we are throughout the weekend. I also don't know. Of course... Let's say last year coming here, I was a lot more confident that we had a big chance of winning the race. But that's how the season is already. It's a lot more competitive. And from our side, I think we're still trying to improve, trying to find a better car balance. And hopefully, yeah, we can start here to find a better balance. It doesn't matter. I mean, of course, you hear about it even before, of course, things get announced. But at the end of the day, I have a great relationship with Jonathan and it always will be like that anyway, even if, of course, he's moving to a different team. But it's a different opportunity for him and also a different role and, yeah, sometimes of course it's also a bit of a new challenge right. So there are no hard feelings or whatever. I'm happy for him, you know, that he gets that opportunity. Of course he will be missed within the team but of course as a team we also have to look at the future and move on from that and Of course, we still have to see how we're going to fill in all the roles that Jonathan currently has. But I'm also happy for him. It goes both ways. And the team is, of course, also very thankful for what he has delivered for the team. So, yeah, there are no hard feelings at all. Yeah, I mean, I like the track. I like, of course, having my home Grand Prix, but there are a lot of factors involved that decide why a Grand Prix is hosted here, right? So at the end of the day, that's not up to me. I enjoy coming here, and I will always enjoy that as long as it's on the calendar. I'm not really worried. I'm also not thinking about Abu Dhabi yet. I just want to improve as a team. I want to improve the car. I know that if we improve our car, then it makes our lives a bit easier. Because the last few races, of course, have been a bit tough, even though I do believe that if we started on pole in Spa, in our normal starting position, without a penalty, we could have still won the race. But it's just very tight margins. And that's why also qualifying is always very important. But yeah, the better performance we have from the car, the easier it becomes. That's what I think what we showed last year. I don't expect it to be like last year, but we always want to try and be better. And especially, you know, the situation that we have been in the last few races, we want to come out of that and learn maybe a bit more from the car and be more competitive. We just focus on the performance on track. Of course, some people have been leaving. Some people have been joining. Some get announced. Some don't. That, I think, is life in Formula 1, especially when you have been very successful. It's normal that other teams try to steal people away. And it's not new to Formula 1 anyway. So I'm not too worried about it. We just need to stay focused and make sure that we have the right people at the right place. That's fine. I mean, everyone thinks their own way, right? I mean, naturally, of course, I get on really well with Checo, right? So I'm happy for him also that maybe these kind of doubts are gone. For me, what I'm very focused on is just improving the car, having more performance. That's what I've been thinking about. You know, talking to the team as well, how to move forward from that. So that has been my worry. as well at the same time. Well, people are, of course, talking about other things. So yeah, just happy to be here again and focus on driving. I think every year you gain more and more experience. I think that naturally helps. I think, of course, as a driver, to fully show your potential also depends a lot on the car, to show how good you are or whatever, but... Naturally, yes, you try every year, when you come back, you want to try and be a little bit better than the year before. It's not any more big steps, I think, in Formula 1 but just fine-tuning little bits here and there. You always have moments in a season where you think, maybe I could have done a bit better or could have approached it a bit different. And that's what you analyse at the end of the year every single time. Yeah. I mean, of course, it's quite difficult to combine with F1 at the moment, having so many races. But for sure, once I stop in Formula 1, I would like to do other stuff, a bit more relaxed, less races in general. With relaxed, I mean that you are also a bit more home, because I know that once I compete in something, of course, I want to be good. I want to win. But let's see what opportunities will come by.",Netherlands,thursday,Red Bull
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, very good. Similar to Max, I think. Spent some good time with family and friends. Had a good week off and then went straight back to training. And yeah, it went very quick, I would say, because we also tested after the race in Spa, so the whole week was a little bit more of a working week, more than a race week. But yeah, all recharged, ready to go, ready to go back racing. And yeah, can't wait to put some laps in the car. Yeah, we knew that, you know, Spa is a place where, you know, historically the car has been performing quite well and better than other places. So I knew that there was going to be an opportunity that we had to take. Obviously, it's only a top 10 finish. It's P9. But, yeah, it's going to be harder, I think, for the rest of the year. So we are going to try and do our best see where we can be in this race. But yeah, for sure the car performed well in Spa. The upgrades worked as expected and yeah I look forward to see if of course we can repeat some of those but I expect that it's going to be a little bit more difficult for us. Yeah, we've improved a lot. Clearly, we were on the last row in Bahrain, and now we are navigating close to top 10 finishes. But if we look at a race, for example, like Budapest, it was a race where we struggled a lot, and we were very far from the points. Spa typically works well for us, and some races have worked well, like Canada as well. But, you know, this type of tracks, you know, could be more difficult. So, you know, we need to just make sure that everything is perfect, that we get the maximum out of the car. And hopefully that will be a successful one for us. Yeah, quite sudden news. I believe everything happened pretty quickly, but obviously those high-level decisions, we as drivers and many of the team members don't know really what's going on behind the scenes. But yeah Oliver has been somebody that I've met some time ago now. He was looking after a kid that I was looking after as well. So we're talking about that quite a lot. He's someone that knows the drivers very well. He's been a driver himself. And he has a lot of experience, obviously, in motor sport. So, yeah, he's going to be here tomorrow. So, yeah, I wish him the best of luck. And obviously, yeah, we're going to be working for the rest of the year together. Well, he's going to have a lot, for sure, a lot of work. A head joining mid-season is not an easy task, but he's somebody of such a calibre that I'm sure he will find his way very quickly. I think we had a crazy successful Paris Olympics. I mean, what we've seen, how many French athletes had gold medals as well. I think we had the record of France being successful as well. and just how the world overall just welcomed it and saw it. I think it was awesome advertising for France in general. I'm really pleased with how it went and proud with the result we got. Yeah, in terms of motor sport, I know we had the virtual racing with Gran Turismo at the time. There isn't enough, obviously, of motor sport categories represented in Olympics. It would be good to make something work. But, yeah, I mean, I don't know how at the moment we could make it work. It seems, you know, difficult. I know in the past we've tried it as a single-seater series, but I don't think it worked well. Yeah, we would need to make something work for sure. But yeah, how to make it, that's more the question. I think many were cool to watch, to be fair, to all the athletes that were there, because they work so hard to show what they are capable of. And some of them, it's only every four years. So yeah, it was cool to watch, and hats off to them. Yeah, it's actually something I was discussing with some members of the team earlier. I didn't realise we had such a gap later in the year. And it's actually, I think, well thought from FOM and FIA, because they are a very hard working load the triple headers. And there's a big jetlag topic as well there. So it's difficult for everyone, for every member in the paddock. So to try and get us there with the battery recharged and get us ready to attack this triple header can be a good thing. It just makes the season very long. So there's always a downside in it. But yeah, happy to try it, happy to see how everyone feels. I know that last year a lot of people were sick and tired, especially after Vegas. That was a very hard one, you know, working at night all the time. And I think, you know, we are trying as a whole to just get that better, looking at the feedback from everyone from last year. So we'll see how it goes.",Netherlands,thursday,Alpine
Zhou Guanyu,"Yeah, it was good. I mean, same as the others. I had a good time. I went back home because obviously I love spending time at home and that's what we miss during the season. So just had some great time with family and friends and had a fun, let's say, two weeks back in Shanghai. I would say, in terms of the results, I feel like that's kind of where we are. But we did miss quite a lot of opportunities, especially at the beginning of the season. I think there's a few occasions we could have had a chance, maybe finishing just around the P10 position. With, you know, the issues we had, I wouldn't go into too much detail, in the pit lane, you know, getting slow stops that that was like kind of resolve a lot of the opportunity, the potential to score the points. So I would say definitely the beginning of the season, we had a lot more opportunities to be fighting closer to the points. But then for the last four or five races, before the summer shutdown, definitely I felt like that's kind of where we were, and unfortunately not competitive enough and not where we hoped for. But looking forward to the remaining ten races, that's for sure, because for myself, finally having the same package and also having some new development coming for not just this race, but for other races as a team, I think gives us higher hopes to be back in format. Yeah, I mean, Mattia is a kind of a person that I knew from before, just because, you know, back in the days when I was with Ferrari Academy, he was there together in the race team. And then he officially only started in Hinwil this week, on Monday. So there's plenty of stuff, works that he have to extract and also to be going through behind the scenes. So I think he's having a quite busy couple of months ahead, but I’m looking forward to working with him. I already had a few chats about him. I think he can really bring his knowledge from the other team to us. I think it's going to be very beneficial. We're talking about it. And of course, we spoke about that. That's, of course, one of the topics that's going forward for the next few weeks and to see where I belong for the remaining [races], next season and onwards. I forgot how to talk. But no, yeah, I did a track walk today. Actually, it's not like the whole track, but it is quite true, like the mean straight and also the back straight, where the both DRS detections are. It's super windy, and the thing tomorrow is another, I don't know, 15, 20 kph more. So I don't think it's undriveable, but it just makes the car, the track condition a bit more unpredictable and especially hopefully stay dry tomorrow and then that will make things quite settle down. And I don't think it's the first time that we have such a windy condition. So I think all the drivers should be fine. You know, I don't think it's too unsafe to drive. OK, I'll do it. Yeah, for me, I think, actually, it's quite an easy one to manage with so many races, because you obviously try to prepare yourself as much as you can before the season starts, just because you know you're going to be fighting through jetlag and also so many races together. But physical side, I think you get into a point that you're racing fit. So you're doing so many races every single weekend and you're constantly in your seat. that really actually makes life a lot easier because the moment you step in the car, start the season, everything just gets very consistent through into the summer break. So, yeah, quite straightforward, to be honest.",Netherlands,thursday,Sauber
George Russell,"Yeah, the summer break was great. I think it was so needed for everyone. I think we're kind of also lucky in this sport that we've got this mandated break. Otherwise, I think people struggle to switch off. Didn't think too much about racing. And then like Sunday night last week, I was struggling to sleep thinking about tyre pressures and rear springs and downforce levels and stuff. So it's funny how the brain shifts. Yeah, absolutely. I think it was clearly we didn't do a good enough job, but it was just a number of factors all coming together where we sort of exceeded our expectation of how much weight we would lose, including myself. You know, I lost a bit more weight during the race than we thought. The tyres lost a lot more than we expected. The plank was wearing more than we thought as well. And it's just sort of these three or four factors all coming together that just pushed us over the edge. Yeah, without doubt. It was such an amazing feeling, just being out there, seeing this opportunity come into life. And Spa is such a unique circuit. They've got these big, long straights. There's a few TV screens down there. And I was sort of looking at the leaderboard and the gap to Lewis, and I think Charles was behind Lewis at the time, and sort of working out, like, you know, they're closing in six or seven tenths a lap, I've got 15, 16 laps to go and I'm 12 seconds or so ahead. I think I'll be able to keep this up. And if they're going to catch me, it's going to be right towards the end. And yeah, that was such, you know, nobody can take that feeling away from me from crossing the line, celebrating with my team, standing on the podium. I think if I was in a championship fight this year, it would have been a much bigger blow to us, those 25 points. But, you know, this season, unfortunately, we're not quite there. I mean, we've got to be setting our sights really high, to be honest, because we are improving drastically in these last couple of races. I do think these last three wins in the last four races probably doesn't perfectly reflect the performance. I think McLaren have been performing really strong. They were probably slightly more competitive than us in Spa last week, last race, sorry. And, you know, Red Bull are a little bit up and down at the moment, but you can be sure they'll be competitive too. But it reminds me a little bit of my junior days in F3, F2, knowing that if you do a great job, there's a victory on the cars. And if you don't, you'll probably be outside the top five. I think the performances we've been showing recently have been really, really strong. But we're not too focused on those points right now. We're just taking it race by race, just trying to understand the car further and try and get some more victories under our belt. Yeah, I mean, Bono's been obviously an integral part of the team's success for so, so many years, and even before the Mercedes days, back at Brawn as well. And, you know, it's great news that he's staying on with us next year. Obviously, there's a lot of rumours and speculation about if he would go with Lewis, but I think there's only a real benefit to me having that promotion for Bono. It's almost having an extra set of eyes overlooking the work we're doing and I think he's only going to strengthen our squad even further. Such as? Well, for sure. there are lots of people back at base looking at the championship because this is what we're fighting towards, but it's no secret whatsoever that we want to fight for championships. And to get there, we just need to keep on evolving this car, keep on improving, keep on working hard. And I think with the regulation going into next year for all of the teams, it's just going to be an evolution of what we see this year. So, you know, we want to continue that improvement. I think right now, I think McLaren have probably still got the best car on the grid. They seem consistently up there every track they go to. The swings in performance from Red Bull are quite surprising to all of us, I think. I don't think anybody would have anticipated that after the first four races, myself included. And I think we're optimistic that we can have some more strong performances. I'm full of excitement and motivation to try and get some more wins under our belt, but... You know, for me, the priority is making sure we have the best car possible by the end of the season and going into next year to really mount a challenge. Should play me in a movie? Oh, my goodness. You really put me on the spot there. Who do you think should play me? I need some inspiration. People say I've looked a bit like Cillian Murphy. I don't quite see the correlation. I don't know if it's the hair, maybe. Peaky Blinders. Yeah, I do love Peaky Blinders. So, yeah, I say Cillian Murphy. Yeah, I think at the moment there's only one driver. It's probably Lando who can beat Max in the championship. They... They obviously had such a incredible start to the season. But who knows, with the number of races we have, Lewis and I were talking this morning about when he first started, I think there were 17 races in the season. So there would have only been three more to go from this point in, and the season would have basically been over already. So there's still lots of opportunity. But personally, I don't see anybody catching up with Max and Rebel in normal circumstances. They have an exceptional lead. It's just we've been used to crazy dominance in the last two years. Thank you, George. Kimi Raikkonen? Sorry? He's the F2 driver, right!? No, I think whoever's going to be my teammate next year, of course, we'll welcome them. And excited for the challenge together. Kimi's an exceptional driver, such an amazing track record. in his junior series, always destined to be a Formula 1 driver. And if it were to be him, I think it sort of shows the strength also of the Mercedes junior program and reminds me a bit of my journey, starting off as a young kid, walking through the doors in Formula 3 and climbing the ladder. And it would be a great story for the team, but who knows? Yeah, I mean, I see him every time he's racing F2. We always keep a close eye on how he's getting on, watching all of the races. We did a test together in Silverstone a couple of months ago, so that was a great opportunity for him to get behind the wheel of a Formula One car. He was exceptionally fast, so I'm sure if he were to get a drive in Formula 1, I'm sure he'd do a great job. Yeah, I think qualifying this year has definitely been a real strength of mine. I feel that I've been driving faster than ever. And I think a lot of that's down to... been in a really great place psychologically. I've worked a lot in making sure, you know, when I arrive into Q3, you know, how to deal with all of that pressure when you're going to do a lap. And I think that's been great. I still think I want to improve a little bit with, well, I was going to say time management, but obviously last race was pretty good, but time management is something, having Lewis as my teammate is I've learned, you know, a huge amount on, and I think he was always, you know, the very best in, in race pace and getting the most out of, out of that. So just very small details to, to make the difference. Yeah, I think… I'd been pushing the team for a long time to keep pushing the boundaries. If you take margin in everything you do, you'd never be disqualified. You'd never make a mistake while driving. You'd never spin off. But you'd never know what the true potential is. And of course, you know, it's very frustrating that the one time in three years we've been just under the weight limit was the race we won. But you know, there's zero hard feelings because we're in this together and it will make us stronger for the future. And that race, I lost 25 points. But in my mind, that is still a win. I've kept my helmet, and it's going to be going on my bedside table with my other two victories. And as I said, those celebrations I had with the team in that moment straight after were some of the best feelings of my career. So I'll only take positives from what happened. I don't think you need to take more margin. I think, you know, the processes weren't quite in place to cover all the different scenarios. You know, I knew before the race I was a little bit light, but it was too late to make a substantial change without eating a steak or something, which was probably not the best pre-race routine. But there are things that now with the benefit of hindsight, we can do better and we will be doing better moving forward. And as always, you need to make a mistake first until you recognise there's a problem. Yeah, I'll be using it tomorrow morning. Lewis will be on the floor from Spa, but we see no issues with that. I think we were uncompetitive on Friday in Spa for different reasons. And this is the challenge when you bring upgrades to the car. There's thousands of reasons why you may be competitive or you may be uncompetitive. This was one factor, but it wasn't the factor of the lack of performance on Friday. So 99% will be proceeding with the new updates on both cars this weekend. I think we have... I think definitely ourselves and McLaren have moved forward. And when you look at the gap to the teams lower down the order, that is definitely very clear. So I don't necessarily think Red Bull, I think they've made a small step backwards with the upgrade they brought. But I think the upgrade we have been bringing to the car was a bigger step forward than we've seen on any other team. So let's see what the next upgrades bring, and hopefully it's more of the same. Yeah, without doubt. Mercedes have a team filled with winners, and I think James Allison has said it before, you don't just forget how to build a fast race car. You encounter problems, you may make a mistake in trying to rectify that, but... the team at Mercedes have not just forgotten how to win races and you know the same as, you know, Lewis has won so many races in in Formula 1, won races in in junior categories. You don't forget how to win when you have that opportunity. That was never ever in doubt and why I personally have always kept the faith that we will return to the top of the grid. Yeah, I think relationships take time to build and trust takes time to, and respect takes time to earn as well. So, you know, with any change of, job as such or professional, whatever it may be, when you're working with new co-workers, it's going to be just take time to learn. So I don't really have much more to say than that, really. They're obviously extremely close for everything they've gone through.",Netherlands,thursday,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, it was good. I didn't spend in Japan last six years in the summertime. So it was really nice, especially I missed the time that you want to spend the time with friends around 18 years old until like 22. It's the best time you can spend around summertime, but I didn't spend it. So yeah, I was able to do finally those summer things with my friends in Japan. So it was really nice. And yeah, I think after that, I came back to Italy and went back in normal shape, you know, to bring back my shape that I had, or even better than the first half of the season to prepare for the second half, especially after drinking a lot in Japan. So it was nice. It sounds very fun. Yeah, these are things I wanted to do. Such as, like, you know, drinking Red Bull, obviously! I mean drinking Red Bull, it's not like ‘drinking-drinking’. Yeah, mostly spending with friends, actually. I try to spend with my family, but actually I'm spending most of time, actually they came quite a lot to the track this year quite often, so I focus more to spending with friends and yeah, just have a nice time with them. Yeah, it was a good first half. I think it came a little bit trickier in the last five races of the first half of the season because of just, like, other competitors are able to develop quite well. They're catching up quite fast and in the end it was very tight midfield and some of the track didn't go well as we wanted and actually we were able to come back strongly. Last three races, as a team, I think will be even more tough. second half of the season. That's what I'm expecting. But I think we have a good team. We keep fighting for P6 in the Championship and we bring a lot of upgrades. first half and I think we're expecting more to come in this season, second half. So, we maximise it and aim high. Yeah, I mean, those things, it's the same thing as the last three years. You know, if you want to prove not just to Red Bull but to other teams. So those things is just the same, same as usual. I mean, there's a lot of speculation, but... The things I'll do are the same and it's not in my control anyway. So I'll try my best and I'll focus on what I can do and what I can focus. Yeah, I'm sure he'll do a good job, but I heard there's not much practice sessions and everything. Actually, most of the drivers in Super Formula, they have a lot of experience at every track. I'm sure in that perspective, it wouldn't be easy for him, but at the same time, I know he's talented and he's very fast. Yeah, I want to see him win or get podiums. In terms of level, Super Formula, to be honest, I've never driven in the groups. But actually, when I was 16 years old, looking back, I had just stepped into the single-seaters. I was looking at the Japanese professional drivers and I was driving one of the pros. Yeah, sometimes when I was in those age I learned a lot of things and they're very fast and I think the level is very high and the knowledge, the feedback, everything, they're very smart on those things. So, yeah, I mean, I'm sure it's one of the very high competitive race series. Yeah. I mean, definitely it's a car I want to drive at one point. I heard a lot of things, and they're very, like, the corner speed is kind of Formula 1. What I heard, especially from Liam [Lawson], for example, it is very similar cornering speed, and you can feel a lot of G-force. So, yeah, and very light car. So it will be nice to drive. To me, just the colour is different. I think inside, the engineers and mechanics, they're pretty much the same. Engineers, there are a couple of people joined our team recently and yeah, I saw a lot of new faces as well, but at the same time, I think, I feel like the energy, especially like Laurent and Franz, how they're thinking, how they want to create the team, there's definitely similarity between them. So I don't feel like extremely like it’s a completely new team, but at the same time, those kinds of synergies that… I don't know, not bringing any more of those kinds of rookie or whatever, focusing more to performance. I don't think that's the right,… It's not the way I think they're trying to do. It's just, I don't know, I think still they're looking for performance, obviously. And as a Red Bull environment, they're always been like that. So I don't think necessarily those things changed. Yeah, I think after Daniel joined with his massive experience, I don't think there's so much situation happening like, you know, those experienced drivers winning Grand Prix winner came into our team. They don't like that situation happening ever. So after those things, it looks like different, but actually I think the synergies, those things are quite the same.",Netherlands,thursday,RB
Logan Sargeant,"The break was great, but it didn't feel quite long enough, if you ask me. But no, it was fun. I got to spend some time with a bunch of my friends in the south of France. And yeah, at the same time, I would like to have gotten home for a little bit. It's been a while. But no, nonetheless, it was nice to get some sun and spend a bit of time with people who I don't always get the chance to. Yeah, I mean, I think obviously the first half of the season hasn't been the best as a whole. You know, for the team, we're obviously looking for performance. We have the upgrades that are coming this weekend. So we're hopeful and optimistic that those are going to you know, elevate us, push us in the right direction, potentially, you know, make us more competitive. So hopefully those work. We'll have to wait and find out. But I think from a track perspective, it's one that one that I enjoy. It's one that I go well at. Weather looks like a big player this weekend, so we'll have to wait and see what that does. But no, I think I think we're ready for whatever for whatever is to come. It was nice to have a bit of a break to recharge and yeah, definitely feel confident coming into it. No, not necessarily. I mean, obviously, it was... quite public that they were trying quite hard to get him. But no, I think in the end, nothing changes. I have 10 more races to go out, drive as well as I can for the people who are working hard for me, my mechanics, my engineers, and hopefully I can make them proud. Depends.",Netherlands,thursday,Williams
Oscar Piastri,"Honestly, yes, I thought I could, but I mean, clean air was such a big difference today. Once I got a little bit of clean air in the middle stint, I picked up a lot of pace and managed to get a nice tyre delta for the last stop, but clearly, you didn't need tyre delta, you just needed to keep going, as George showed. So, no, happy with the result. I think we managed the race very well. I think that's the second or third time this year we've tried to run over the front jack, so I'll try not to do that next time. But, no, very happy with the results, and I don't think we could have done too much more. I think just not quite enough speed. I think it took me a couple of laps to get past Charles and I really overheated the tyres doing that. But, yeah, I mean, clearly the pace for George staying out there on one set of Hards was the right thing to do. So we just didn't quite have enough pace to mow him down. Even Lewis, you know, didn't quite have enough. I think we did a lot of things right, gave ourselves the best opportunities we could, but in the end, it wasn't quite enough. Positive. Yeah, I mean, it's been a really good couple of weeks for myself and the whole team, of course. You know, a lot of points. You know, we still made inroads on Red Bull today, and that's a really positive thing going into the break. I think everyone's looking forward to a bit of a break. I know I am, so I can heal up a little bit. But, no, it's been a fun couple of weeks and looking forward to some time relaxing and coming back even stronger in the second half. Yeah, I mean, pretty happy on the whole. I think it was a really well executed race. I think, yeah, clearly the one-stop was a possibility and I think probably there's a lot of people out there kicking themselves that they didn't consider it more. But no, I think we executed a great race, had a quick car and, you know, ultimately just didn't put it in the right position in qualifying yesterday. So, yeah, I think given where we started, very happy. But yeah, ultimately, I think there was a bit more potential this weekend. It did cross my mind, but not seriously enough. I was amazed at how much difference the dirty air made today. I think when Lewis and Charles pitted for the second stop, I think I went like one second faster just because I had clean air. So that was impressive, but then it felt like it kind of degged a little bit again after that point. And with 16 laps, I think it was, or 15 laps around Spa, it felt like a pretty big risk to try and go to the end. And I knew that even with the tyre advantage that we were building up, that we had a strong chance to try and win the race anyway that way. So yeah, maybe we should have considered the one-stop a little bit more. But I think with the two-stop, I think we did a good job of capitalising on it. Just unfortunately, on my side, didn't give us the track position in qualifying. I would say so. I'm not sure my front jack man agrees, but no, I think it was a really strong race. You know, I think to try and get past Charles was not easy. And I think if I didn't manage to do it on that lap, I probably would have been stuck there for a long time. So that was a pretty pivotal moment of the race. I think just the pace was very strong. So I felt very, very good this weekend. Even on Friday, the pace looked really strong. You know, just kicking myself a little bit that I didn't get qualifying right. But yeah, I think it was a very strong, strong weekend and probably one of my one of my better races. Um, yeah, I mean, I think definitely the last few weeks have been, been very strong from, from my side. I think honestly the whole season's been, been pretty good. A couple of weekends in the middle of the year were, were a bit tricky. Japan and China mainly were pretty tough and obviously Barcelona, but I feel like all the other races have been, been quite strong. Just we've had a lot of things that that haven't been going our way in some ways. Whether it's interesting track limit penalties or crashes or mistakes, there's always kind of been just things and I feel like the last few weekends I have been able to tidy it up. So, I feel like I've taken a step forward from last year, definitely. And, you know, I think in these tricky kind of races like this, you know, last year I was struggling in a race like this. So I feel like I've made good progress and obviously the car is very quick as well. So yeah, I feel like I'm gaining some nice momentum, which is good, but I know how quickly it can turn around and go the other way as well. So no, I just keep trying to build on it, but I feel like I'm in a strong place.",Belgium,post-race,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"No, we definitely didn't. And, I mean, first I have to say congratulations to George and to the team. No, we had such a disaster on Friday. The car was really nowhere, and we made some changes. Hard to see what it was going to feel like, obviously, because of the wet day yesterday, but the car was fantastic today, and we really owe it to everyone, both here, doing a solid job through the pit stops and strategy, and the guys back at the factory. I mean, I was trying to get closer, obviously, but George did a great job on going long on the tyres. Every stint, I had tyres left, but the team pulled me in. So, you know, yeah, unfortunate, but it is one of those days. No. It would be high hopes. But, I mean, if we can continue this kind of performance as we've had the last few races, which has been fantastic, I think if we can start our weekends off a little bit better, hopefully we can continue. I think, obviously, the McLaren was very strong today, but we were just a bit further ahead early on. But, yeah, we've just got to keep pushing. I think it was great. George did a fantastic job today. Obviously, I'll re-watch the race but yeah, fantastic effort to go the one-stop. And it was pretty smooth sailing, to be honest. I was fully in control. I had plenty of pace and tyres and just didn't end up as planned. I mean, if you listen, you could have heard what I said to the team most of the time. But yeah, I think the tyres were pretty good. I still had plenty of tyres and I was going quicker. I didn't want to stop. It was literally night and day different today. On Friday, it was pretty disastrous for both of us and really struggling with balance. And then today, the car came alive and I was really surprised to, firstly, get into the lead and then be pulling away from everyone and not... Yeah, as I said, it felt fully under control and I've not had that for years and so that's why it was also a bit of a strange way to finish it. but it is it's great to go into the into the summer break with the one two. the team did really deserve it and did such an amazing job. I just had something as I was going through the corner. Something kept rolling underneath my left leg. You must be new here. I don't have a good memory, so I don't remember back then. But what I can say is it's great. It's really fantastic, I think, for the sport to be having such close teams and drivers. And, you know, the pedigree of drivers at the top today are really elite and amazing. Yeah, we didn't expect to be competing with the McLarens or the Red Bulls at this point in the season, you know, with how we started off. So for us to now have closed up and be, it's going to be one hell of a second half of the season for sure. No, I just said that the tyres were fine. And I'm happy. Looking forward to going to the summer break. I mean, just overall, the car is... We're more comfortable in the car. The balance through low to medium to high are all much more in line with what we had targeted.",Belgium,post-race,Mercedes
George Russell,"Yeah, amazing result. We definitely didn't predict this win this morning in our strategy meeting, but the car was feeling really awesome, and we made a lot of changes from Friday night. And the tyres just felt great, and I just kept saying, you know, ‘I think we can do the one-stop, I think we can do the one-stop’. And the strategy did a really great job. And also, you know, well done to Lewis, because he really controlled that race and circumstances were slightly different. I'm sure he would have got the victory. But, you know, 1-2 for the team was such an awesome result and such a great way to go into the break. I mean, I was focusing a lot during the race, so I'll have to listen to the radio comments back, but it was a team effort. You know, Joey, Leo, all the strategy guys did an amazing job. And, you know, always it's that team effort. So we rolled the dice, but it was only possible because the car was feeling really great and the pace was there. So, yeah, 1-2, such a good result. Absolutely. Yeah, it's three wins in six, I think it is for us now. You know, I'd want another race next weekend, to be honest. You know, just... Just feeling so, so good. The team have been working so hard. And, yeah, so well deserved for everybody back at Brackley and Brixworth. Yeah, for sure. It was such a difficult race. We spoke so much this morning about the two-stop, the three-stop. But suddenly the tyres, the car felt really, really good. I got into this groove. And especially when I got into the lead, there were no back markers in front, no other cars in front. And it kind of felt like driving a simulator. It was quite weird. And I was looking at the gap to Lewis and the rate he was catching me. And I just thought there's no reason why we can't stay out here and do this one stop and try and make it work. So, yeah, super proud of the job we all did. I think it was about 15 laps ago, to be honest. I think when Oscar pitted and Charles and Lewis, I was just watching the TV screens every lap, down after Eau Rouge, and just looking at the gap every single lap. And they just weren't catching me as quick as I expected. And my lap times were just improving every single lap. And that was far from what we all anticipated. But it just goes to show how difficult it is to predict. I think every lap we were driving, 20 drivers, full gas around this circuit and it was just getting faster and faster. The grip was improving. And the tyres just felt really in a great state. But I was still questioning why nobody else did it. I thought, I must be missing something here because everybody's peeling into the pits, but yeah, such a great race. I definitely thought he was going to be very close. But equally, I recognise how difficult it is to overtake here. You know, we're all running these skinny rear wings. The drag isn't substantial. But I just want to acknowledge what a great race Lewis drove. You know, he was really controlling it at the beginning. And, you know, the strategy was such a difficult call for everybody. And it was definitely… That one stop was a real surprise. But I'm so proud of the team. One-two is just a huge result. Team effort. Three and four. Is it three and four? Wow. I think the competition was really high today. I don't know what the gaps were at the end, but it felt like the pace between myself, Lewis, Oscar and the Red Bulls, Charles as well, it was so, so close, which was a real surprise for everyone. So it's going to be a real battle. Yeah, we've got, yeah, it was, yeah… Top secret! Yeah, it was a lot of things we changed in the car. We've got a lot of things we can play around with. I think we just had it in the wrong window on Friday. We obviously reversed on the floor because we just wanted to rule that out as well. But I've got no doubt. in Zandvoort we'll be returning to the new aero package and getting the car in a slightly different window mechanically.
LH: Same. It was quite back and forth over the course of three laps. And I think it's difficult because when you feel something in your gut, you have to go with it. But when every single driver and team is pitting to go on to a different alternative strategy, and after all the data we had on Friday suggested a one-stop was not even close to being viable, you do kind of question that a couple of times,  thinking, ‘are we missing something here?’ Like, why isn't anybody else doing this? But, you know, I just sort of felt at one with the tyres and I managed it a little bit at the beginning and I knew that would give me a bit of money back at the end. I think it's a show, you know… we've got so many sensors and data points on the car, but there's only 20 of us driving these F1 cars and sometimes you feel it. You can feel how the tire is sliding over the track. And you've just got to trust your gut sometimes. Yeah, I think it's. You've clearly got to manage the tyres if you want to do something that's so sort of off-piste. It goes hand in hand. It was great. The team sort of backed me up and put their faith in me to do the one-stop. And then obviously, you know, when you're behind the wheel, you've got to deliver it and manage in certain corners, push in others. And also at the end, I knew Lewis was catching me, but I knew I needed to be quick in three corners, and that was the last two corners and the first one. I knew if I could save the tyres in the middle sector and nail it in those three corners, it would be very difficult for Lewis to pass into Turn 5. So, yeah, team effort. I really need to look into it because this season's really been quite strange when we've been slightly off the pace in Austria and Barcelona. We didn't have the answers then. And when the pace was so exceptionally quick in Montreal and Silverstone, we had some ideas why it was quick but not to the magnitude that it was. So, for sure, we think there's some correlation with the temperature. It's obviously not the warmest here. There was a bit of cloud cover, so I think that is probably still the correlation we're seeing. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think for all of us, It's been a difficult couple of years getting the car into a place where we can consistently fight for victories. But, you know, I'm so motivated, so excited for the second half of the season, which is ultimately building up towards 2025. And when you look at the competition now, you know, there's no reason why we can't fight. And if the season started in Montreal, the championship standings would be looking very, very different. So, you know, it's going to be great. There's so much, I think there's so much motivation from all the other teams to get back to the front, from McLaren, from Ferrari, from ourselves. So for sure, it's not going to be easy. And, you know, hopefully we see a good fight on our hands into next year. No, I mean I just went in a bit hot really. I felt like on Friday there was a lot of grip in the pit lane and I was kind of always undershooting the box. Even my first pit stop I probably undershot it a little bit. I had to brake a little bit, with Lewis coming out, so maybe I was coming in a bit slow. but the second one clearly was a little bit overdone. It wasn't my finest moment. I don't think it really cost much in the scheme of things. I think it meant I probably would have just been stuck behind Lewis and George for another lap or two at the end. But yeah, obviously, something I want to tidy up for all the other races. No.",Belgium,post-race,Mercedes
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was very tricky at times. Obviously, as always, you know, in these conditions, it's so easy for it to go wrong, as it's been going in the last few qualifyings in these conditions. And, yeah, I mean, it was good to finally put it together. Unfortunately, we didn't have any new tyres for Q3. We were a bit out of sync in Q2, so we were also quite lucky to make it in P10. And I think P2 is probably the best position you can wish for in Spa, you know. It was the same with Charles last year, so I'm going to be trying tomorrow to be the same. And, yeah, it's a long race ahead of us. It looks like it's going to be dry, so we'll see. Yeah, you know, I mean, like I've always said, you know, every weekend it's a new opportunity to do better, every day, you know. Tomorrow is a new opportunity for us to do even better than today and go for that win. We'll see, you know, it's a very long race ahead of us. I think tomorrow degradation will be quite tricky, and graining with this new tarmac. I think there are a lot of unknowns still, but I’ve got a good feeling for tomorrow, so we'll see. Not initially. We tried a lot of things. We kept throwing things at it. And it's never ideal when you don't have progression. And once again, today we threw at it a lot of things. I think we found a nicer window, a little bit similar in the direction of Hungary. But we were a lot happier with the car, so I think… Although, I mean it's on Inter conditions but the balance in the medium high-speed was feeling positive, in the right direction. So let's see tomorrow. I think tomorrow is going to be a very different day and let's see where how much we are able to improve. I think already I was quick in Q1, Q2. The problem was our run programme. We finished a lap before everyone. I think I was P4 or something. But then, you know, when you give a lap away, everything was really, really close. So we were very lucky to be able to make it. I think it was, yeah, it was definitely a mistake on our run programme to left us vulnerable, basically. I think yesterday McLaren looked very strong. But at the same time, we are not that far away. So we've done some changes in the direction of tomorrow. So we'll see. I think after the first stint, we will have a good idea. From my point of view, it doesn't change anything. You know, I've always said it's not where we are now, it's how you ride the waves and where we finish in Abu Dhabi. I mean, there are a lot of drivers that haven't been able to maximise their performance lately, but obviously, the scrutiny on my side has been quite a bit higher. It doesn't change anything from my point of view. I think tomorrow is a new day, a new opportunity. It would have been the same if I was knocked out in Q2. Tomorrow is a new opportunity to do better. And it's the way I see it. It's tomorrow what really counts. And if I don't have a good race tomorrow, I will try to have a good one in Zandvoort. It's how it is, this is a sport and sometimes it goes your way, sometimes you have to fight and nothing goes in your direction, but I think it's just the nature of the sport. More than confidence, I mean, it's not like I forgot how to drive, you know, from five, six races ago. It's just that you see it with a lot of drivers. Sometimes you're not able to maximise the full potential of your car. And for that reason, you end up lacking that, let's say, confidence to extract the maximum out of the car you have. I think we've been taking good step forwards in the right direction since Hungary. I think Silverstone was already quite good, I had a really good Friday. So I think the season… The car is going in the right direction for now and hopefully tomorrow we are able to finish it off with a strong result. And still, there is a long way to go in the season. So yeah, just head down and I think like I've said before, you know, the team and myself are focusing on and what we’ve got to do. At the end of the day it's getting the most points we possibly can and the rest couldn't care less to be honest. Confidence. Same. Yeah, I think they've been the best car, let's say, for the last five races or so in different types of circuits. They've been strong, certainly in the race pace, and I think the break comes at a good time for Red Bull because we've got a lot to analyse on our season, the directions we've been taking, and hopefully get the balance a little bit more together for the second half of the season. More than any other upgrade, I think getting the balance in the right window will be the main key and the main focus to see what we've done, the upgrades we have brought to see where exactly we are, because I feel like we've been a little bit lost lately.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, exactly the same. It's good. I mean, I definitely did not expect that this weekend. Obviously, with the tricky conditions, we could do something above our expectations. So, yeah, it's a good day for the team. Now we need to focus on tomorrow and see what will happen whenever the rain is gone. Yeah, I think that without this rain, probably P5 was the position we were fighting for, with the Mercedes especially. But obviously with the rain, it helped us a little bit. But I'm not going to complain. I'm really happy. I'm very happy with the lap in Q3. And it's good to be back on the front part of the grid. But now we've got to finalise that tomorrow. Yeah, it's not the easiest first place to keep on the first lap here. But honestly, I will see it. Every start is different. And then once I'll be in the car tomorrow through Eau Rouge, I'll decide what's the best thing I can do. But obviously, I'll try to keep that first place. Thank you very much. Thank you. It was a good lap. As Max said, the rain picked up a little bit at the end of Q3, which maybe there was a bit more to find on the first part of Q3, but obviously anyway, P1 was out of reach for us today. It's a lot better than what we expected coming into the weekend, and especially after yesterday, that was a very difficult day for the team once again. So yeah, the tricky conditions helped us today. I mean, the old asphalt seems to be drying up pretty quickly, whereas the new asphalt a little bit slower. So that was a little bit tricky. But all in all, it was fine. I think there was quite a good grip on the new asphalt, which made it quite fun to drive in wet conditions. I cannot remember about last year. Too long ago, and so many things have happened since then. Then for sure, if we are looking for tomorrow, it's going to be a tricky race for us. It will be dry conditions. And on dry conditions recently, we've been struggling a little bit more. However, the McLaren is a bit further away than what we wanted. There's Checo right behind. That will be the main target, and then we'll see how it goes after the first stint. But it's a good starting position. It's also a track where you can overtake quite easily, so we'll need the pace, and that we’ll only have the answer tomorrow. We didn't change the balance that much actually from Q1 to Q3. I think where we improved quite a bit was to put the tyres in the right window. That was super important and in those conditions that's always where you struggle. So this we did some modifications especially on the out lap and how much you push and where you push. And then I felt more at ease, and that helped me for Q3. So, yeah, it was all about fine-tuning the out lap and putting the tyres in the right window. No, I'm very surprised. And actually, even when I finished the lap, I didn't feel like it was worth a second place. I mean, it was a good lap, a clean lap, and that's what you need in those conditions. And I believe that especially when you get to Q3 in the last lap, everybody knows that this is the lap, and that pushes people to maybe do more mistakes. On my side, it was a clean lap, but not an incredible lap. So yeah, I'm very happy to be P2 but I definitely did not expect that. I think as a team today P5 will have been a bit of a good result and today we are P2 and tomorrow we will be starting on pole. So that's a good thing. But as I said we don't have any magical solution for the race pace and it will be a bit of a tricky day tomorrow. Today, it was fine. But obviously, in wet conditions, it's always a little bit less of an issue. Yesterday, we struggled a bit more with it. But I don't expect this to be an issue tomorrow during the race. So this is a positive. So yeah. But if it was a dry quali, I would have expected it to be a bit more of a struggle for us.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a nice qualifying. Luckily, the weather was okay. It was just raining a little bit, but at least we could do a decent qualifying. Yeah, everything worked well. Every tyre set that we were on, we could just do good lap times. I was, of course, also thinking about Q3, not knowing if it was going to dry out, so I was trying to keep two new sets for Q3, and luckily we escaped in Q1, Q2, so... Yeah, very happy. I mean, the car was working quite well in the wet. Yeah, I could just do my laps and try to do clean lap times in the wet, which is always quite tricky. But tomorrow, of course, I know that it's quite a different day. It's going to be warmer, normally no rain. So it's all about tyre degradation. And, yeah, we just need to make sure we're good on that. I know that, of course, I have to start also ten places back, so this was the best I could do today. And then go from there. I don't know how quick we're going to be. I hope that we can be in the mix, you know, to try and move forward. Yeah, the race can be lost, of course, in Turn 1, so just need to see what happens, you know, in the start, naturally, and just go from there. It's a very long race, it's very hard on tyres, and just need to try and manage that as good as we can, and hopefully then we can be competitive tomorrow. We are not making it easy on ourselves, and especially, of course, in the battle that we're in. I know that today was a great day, but it's in the wet. We need to be quick in the drive tomorrow. But yeah, it's going to be a tough battle. Yeah, we'll try to do the best we can. Hopefully, we can battle the Ferraris and the Mercedes, of course, ahead. And if we have a bit of luck, of course, maybe we can challenge the McLaren. Yeah, it was a good day. Of course, yesterday we tried a few things with the car. I think we learned from that. And today we tried to put on the car what we thought was best. And I think, as you could see, we ran maybe also a little bit more downforce compared to some competitors. So naturally, of course, in the wet, probably it's a little bit more stable and that can help, of course, around here. But overall, I think the laps were good in qualifying all the way from Q1 to Q3. I passed Q1 and Q2 only on one tyre set, so I think that was important because that gave me, of course, a better opportunity for Q3. Yeah, everything was working well, but, of course, today is not as important because tomorrow is going to be dry, it's going to be warmer, and we need to be good on tyres and, of course, starting 10 places back. It is going to be, of course, a little bit more tricky. I don't expect it, of course, to be like the last two years. Naturally, looking at the cars around us being quite quick. So, yeah, we'll just try to move forward, try to fight Ferraris, Mercedes, and with a bit of luck, maybe the McLarens, but it all depends on our pace ourselves. I had another tyre set, so I was like, let's try and go faster. I'm not sure what happened. I was very close to my lap time in places, like gaining, losing. Maybe it just rained a little bit more and it just didn't give me the same grip. But I mean, both laps are almost identical. So when you have the tyres, I mean, you can try and get a better lap out of it. Survive lap one and just go from there. I mean, we also have a bit of a different tyre strategy to the other cars, so we have to wait and see how that will evolve in the race. But, yeah, we'll see what we can do. I mean, I'm not as confident as I was the last two years around here in coming back to the front. I still see it more as a damage limitation race. That's how it is. But at least today was the best possible we could do in terms of the starting position for tomorrow. I think overall the balance is a bit better, yeah. If it's going to be enough to be the quickest, I'm not sure. But yeah, hopefully we can just have it all a bit more under control. I felt a bit more confident and comfortable on the FP1 wing. So I hope that that is also going to be the case tomorrow. Tomorrow is a bit warmer as well, so naturally probably a bit more sliding. I just hope, yeah, that it's better for me. But when you look at the McLaren, for example, they run a very skinny wing. Seems to work for them, but it didn't really work for me yesterday. So yeah, bit of a different strategy also there. And I guess we'll find out tomorrow how it will work out. I mean, I have to pass cars. The DRS effect is quite big around here, but at the end of the day, I think it's more important just to be good on tyres around here. Because if you're good on tyres, you can pass people. I think it's all down to the drivers! No, well, like I mentioned before, we run a bit more downforce, so for sure that is good for today. One lap pace is of course important, but it's more important to be good on the tyres tomorrow. I feel like most of the last qualifyings, we have been quite close over one lap, even when I was still not entirely happy with the car or the balance. But then in the race, sometimes there have been bigger differences for me. So it's important that tomorrow we are good on tyres and competitive, of course, as well. Looking at their pace yesterday in the long run, it's incredibly strong. They look very comfortable out there. Of course, they are starting a little bit further back, I think they're so fast they will quite quickly challenge for the front, for the lead. And it also depends a bit, of course, how I get through lap one and stuff. But I would already be happy if we can match that race pace. So starting a bit further back, also being on different tyres, I don't know how that is going to work out. Most teams around us have two hard tyres, we don't. I don't know if that's better or not, of course, for the moment, but we'll find out tomorrow. But, yeah. It's definitely still a damage limitation. Well, I think if you look at the last five, six races, they for sure have been the best. I mean, quite clear. And I mean, that's fine. Fair play to them. I think they have done a great job. From our side, yeah, we have a bit of work to do, a few things also to analyse over the break. From race one all the way to here, what we have done. And then, yeah, try to fight back from Zandvoort, see if we can actually improve the situation, try to turn it around, try to be more competitive. I think the battle is in a way still quite tight. So, you know, when you make small mistakes, it definitely can swing quite quickly. And yeah, we have to try to use that in our advantage as well, because it's so difficult at the moment. But we'll see. I mean, there are so many races left and so many things that can happen. You can have the best possible preparation into every single weekend, but even then things can catch you by surprise. So you just have to remain focused, calm, and try to improve.",Belgium,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Valtteri Bottas,"Yeah, quite sudden news. I believe everything happened pretty quickly, but obviously those high-level decisions, we as drivers and many of the team members don't know really what's going on behind the scenes. But yeah, quite unexpected, but obviously welcoming Mattia to the team. And at the same time, I want to thank Mr Seidl and Mr Hoffman for their contribution to the team. It's a bit of a reset again. It's not a secret that when there's a new leadership, it will always take a bit of time, first of all. Mattia needs to know what are the weaknesses, what are the strengths, what are the priorities for short- and long-term improvements, and that's going to take a bit of time. Again, it's the third time now in three years, within three years, that we've had change at the top, so not a new situation, and the team shouldn't be too affected at this point. I think it's more the stuff for the future, and obviously time will show what will happen. I don't want to go too much into details. Obviously, some things are internal, but we know that compared to, let's say, at the moment, to the big teams, we're still lacking a bit of human power. We could do with more people, but at the same time, the team has been hiring and growing recently quite a bit. There are certain areas that we definitely need to focus on, at the factory but also with the car performance. We're at the moment not where we need to be and that's basically we needed some new upgrades and into the right direction. It's going to be, even though it's a long lap, I think it's going to be still close where we are. We did make a step in Budapest. Again, it's a very different type of track. So I wouldn't say too detailed predictions, but hopefully we're going to be in the mix and fighting close to top 10 like we did on Saturday in Budapest. I've been there, mate. Yeah, it's... There were a few. You know, I think everything's been pretty much mentioned already and agreed that there's certain rules, depends on the team, depends on the situation, but normally it comes back to you. So obviously I would give the place back because I'm an amazing team player. No. In my whole life, no regrets. Well, definitely the last year or two, it's not been really stable. We've not being really super stable as a team because there's been lots of people leaving, lots of people joining. Now another change in the leadership. So for sure that doesn't help the here and now moment. And even the previous shake-up, it was made for the future and more like for long term. But with the change again, yeah, I think if we've had the same, let's say, leadership and so on for the last few years and that stability, then maybe there's more time to focus on the issues and solving them. But yeah, this team, to me, it's been pretty clear that all the decisions in the last year or two has been made to be competitive from ‘26. I know it's not ideal in some cases, and like for me, unfortunately, many times fighting towards the back end, but like I said earlier, my job is still to do the very best I can and at the same time push the team and contribute the best I can. That's all I can do at the moment. I wouldn't say that it feels like two separate teams. Obviously, yeah, there has been a change again and now everyone needs to get to know Mattia better. And yeah, looking forward to actually start working with him. But no, it still feels like one team. But yeah, for sure, like I said, it's not been super stable lately. But hopefully from now on, things will be a bit more stable and there's a clear direction. I've got a bottle opener in my back pocket, so... No, joking aside, it is going to reset a bit the talks, because we have previously been in communication with Andreas and Oliver, and now it's Mattia, who just will officially start next week, I believe. So yeah, for sure that will change some things, so we need to… We need to speak. And yeah, I think the big part of the remaining driver market is waiting for Carlos' move. That's no lie. But also not completely relying on that. It's a bit of a complicated situation, but let's see. I'm sure the cork will pop at some point.",Belgium,thursday,Sauber
Daniel Ricciardo,"So predictable, Thomas, so predictable. I don't know. Yeah, honestly, I don't know. But like always, just focus on myself and what I can do. Every race or few races, the narrative changes and that's the sport we're in. Things are happening quickly and you’ve just got to try and, I think in these situations, focus on yourself and get the most out of that and then see where the wind takes me. No changes from the approach. Coming into Budapest, I knew it was going to be two important weekends coming up before the break and obviously hit the break with a bit of momentum. So yeah, that's where my head's at. So try and do well. Sounds selfish, doesn't it? I mean, I'm definitely happier where I am now than the first few races this season. You know, I think I was... I felt good all season, but it wasn't quite clicking, for lack of a better word, you know, the first few races. And I think then I've been able to get more out of myself, certainly the last few races. And I think it's trending in the right direction. And I think that's obviously important. Of course you want to be awesome every race, but I knew obviously after the first few that I still had to find a little bit, but I'm definitely happier. I'm more comfortable with where I'm at and yeah, just showing those signs of speed that I know I have. And that's obviously… All of us are trying to extract that out of ourselves every weekend and some weekends come easier than others. But I think, yeah, I'm certainly sitting here now, much happier than probably, I don't know, two or three months ago. I mean, the circuit helped us, because I think we were pretty strong already from Friday. And we hit the ground running, and we didn't really have to chase it. It just came, and that was that. So some circuits certainly help. But it's still so unpredictable. Did we know we would be really strong in Budapest? Not necessarily, but yeah, I think we've a bit more time now, we've understood everything and we, yeah, you just, I guess it helps getting to the weekend with a better understanding of the package and then knowing, okay, we pretty much know the window of what this car likes, the set-up. Okay, it's a big downforce circuit, so let's see what that does, but... We had a bit more confidence, I guess. I feel like I just repeated myself a lot. But yeah, we'll see. I don't know. It's the midfield, the midfield mystery. It's always pretty unpredictable where we are. Thank you. Daniel? Yeah. I mean, I agree. I think these things come around. I think the advice he was given was also good. Because in the heat of the moment, you don't kind of see it all, so to speak. It's like you see a win in front of you, and that's it. You know, they're talking about the championship and we win as a team and you might need Oscar's help and this and that. And I think that's kind of the perspective sometimes you need, I guess, in the heat of the moment. And yeah, that's a thing. Also, as Carlos said, it's a team game and you do need the team to help you. And there'll be times where, again, it comes around and it'll work in his favour. As much as you don't want to hear it, of course, at times, and yeah, we're all here to win. I think long-term play, it's definitely the smartest one. Russia, 2018? It's hard because I think, you know, if in that case, obviously we're talking about Lando and Oscar here. So in the case of Lando staying in front and then it fractures the relationship, not only with the team, but then with your team-mate and Oscar, you know, there's not three races to go. There is still half a season to go. Yeah, I just think with that and looking ahead at the rest of the season, yeah, there will be times where Lando might need to lean on Oscar. And if you fracture that still with a half a season to go, I think that's where it becomes difficult. So, yeah, look, maybe me as a young kid in Formula 1 would have thought very different about this. But I think with age and a little bit of experience and wisdom, I think this is the way you have to look at it. Yeah, I mean, I still speak with Christian and Helmut on that side still quite a lot. And yeah, I mean, a lot still goes through them, honestly. So that's that. I mean, other parts of the team? Not really, because obviously I'm here and I focus on this stuff here with my team and my engineers and everything. Obviously, last year I was exposed t,… I was inside the driver's meetings, like the post-session debriefs, and asking all the engineers some questions and whatever, but clearly that's not the case now. But yeah, the Christian and Helmut side still, and It's good to see them after a good result. Helmut still is, he’ll let you know when the result's not good, but yeah, I definitely feel happy being back in that and under that kind of microscope, if you will, and in that environment with a little bit of that pressure, it's fun. But yeah, that's probably the best way I can answer it. Russell. Yeah, on that as well, it's definitely, they can't help being tall. So it is unfair if they have to kind of dehydrate themselves just to make the weight, so to speak. But even us, if we're not, even reaching that weight it is nice that we have the freedom to yeah be the athletes that we need to be and it's not like ‘oh, we have to watc out, we can't do too much strength training or…’ So, having a little bit of freedom now around our training and uh that's I think that's a big benefit for a lot of us. First word, waffles. Second word, Pouhon. And third… Eau Rouge is two, so I have to just... Ah, he helped me. Raidillon. Oui. So I heard the in-race radio stuff. I didn't hear any TV pen or post-race stuff, so I don't know if that continued. But yeah, I heard, let's say, the little conversations between him and GP. Look, sometimes it's hard to explain why we… Okay, I’ll put myself in this position. Some races I'm super calm and other races I'm agitated and everything frustrates me and annoys me. So sometimes our actions or the way we feel is not always predictable. Yeah, I mean, I don't probably have enough… I mean, the context is, you know… I think there was one where GP said something about bringing the tyres in. Obviously, Max didn't. He just probably pushed straight away. And that's, you know, I would say that's coming from a place of frustration. So something leading up to that has probably made him just be like, I don't care anymore. I'm just going to push and see what happens. So obviously, it's probably built up frustration through the race. But yeah, it happens. I don't know. I don't really know how to answer it. Yeah, going back and forth, having conversations through the race, yeah, it's probably not ideal, but yeah, I guess we've all been there at times where you, you know… For me, the race was frustrating on Sunday. For whatever reason, I chose silence to let that do the talking. And, okay, on the in-lap, then I said a bit more, but in a way I just couldn't be bothered chatting about it through the race because for me, like what was done was done. So any talk I had kind of felt a bit hopeless or helpless. So that was my way of handling my frustration in that race. So it can vary. It's race-to-race dependent, I guess. It's a hot and sometimes very flustered environment in the cockpit. Yeah. I mean, I know that it's… I don't want to say you're as good as your last race, but there is, like, when it comes to these moments, these races are more critical than any other. So as I said, coming into Budapest, and this wasn't anything I'd heard from them, but even just myself, just telling myself, ‘look, these could be two very, very important races in my career and just leave it all out there and do everything I can’. Because look, obviously going up, that's, as I said last year, that's like my goal. I'd love to return, but you know, there's also talks that will I even be here? So it's like, there is so much to kind of fight for. And yeah, I think for that, I just really made a point to every race you prepare. And of course, you do what you can. But I just made a point for these two coming up that, yeah, leave it all out there. And that's that. So yeah. We'll see. Yeah, it does feel different, you know, and I think it's easy to kind of rebrand it and say we’ve got a new look and with this and that, but your actions have to follow. And I think, you know, Laurent, Peter, Alan, a lot of guys that have come in have done that, you know. It's not that what was happening in the past with Franz, in that example, wasn't the right thing, but a change sometimes is good. You bring in new ideas. They've all spent time in other teams, organisations. And yeah, it's just a new way of looking at things. And I think that in itself and their intentions and the way they go about it has made people kind of stand up and say, alright, this isn't a junior team anymore. We're making, kind of, big boy decisions and we're taking risks and we're setting targets and high targets and ones that we realistically think that we can attain. So, it's cool. It's cool to see it. I'm probably too, in a way, like honest in myself that if it felt like a junior team still, I wouldn't feel comfortable here. I'm 35 now. So, I think I would feel a bit out of place. And I certainly don't. So I think that's also a good way to probably comprehend it. I mean, I won a race there, so I don't know what you're talking about! I had heaps of success there. Oh, it's hard. Obviously, most of my time there was a bit more of a struggle or a challenge. So, look, did I predict this? I'm not going to say yes, because I don't think I did. So I guess from that point of view, it is a bit of a surprise that in two years, less than two years, they are probably currently the quickest package on the grid. But I also don't look at that like, ‘oh man, like if only I could have had that’. That's the sport, that's how it is. And I think as Carlos said before, you take your hat off to them. Anyone in this sport that's doing well and developing and making such a big step in a short amount of time, you have to compliment that.",Belgium,thursday,RB
Carlos Sainz,"So predictable, Thomas. I think, first of all, I'm not up to date with everything that is going on at every team but of course I think the arrival of Mattia to any team is positive, mainly because he has the experience of what it takes to build a team that is a top team nowadays, like it is  at Ferrari. And he has that experience from Ferrari that he can bring into Audi. And I'm sure it's a great asset for them. And that's why they hired him. And yeah, of course, I wish him all the best there. Not really. I think my future is still being discussed and obviously analysed very carefully. And there's changes to a lot of teams that I'm looking at for next year pretty much every week. So there's changes, evolution on the team market as much as there is on the driver market. And I'm just going to keep giving myself time to take the decision to analyse all these things that keep changing. without giving you too many clues here. Completely different circuit to Hungary. I think Hungary is somewhere closer to, for example, Barcelona in terms of the downforce and the corner speeds. But yeah, I think now Spa is going back a bit more towards Silverstone kind of track. And last time we were in Silverstone, we struggled as a team. So yeah, encouraged to see the progress in Hungary, or we were a little bit quicker in Hungary, especially in the race. But let's see how we are in Spa and if we can keep trying to get closer to the, I would call them now top two teams, because it's clear that McLaren and Red Bull, when they switch it on, they have three or four tenths advantage over us. Not that kind of history, for sure. We were not fighting for easy one-twos at my time in McLaren. A team order is a team order. And I think the team always comes first. It's been that way, the way I've approached my Formula 1 career over these last 19 years. And yeah, a team order, as much as it hurts, and it must have hurt to have let Oscar by, it's a team order. And yeah, analysing the situation, if they give you an undercut for free on your team-mate, most likely than not, you need to let your team-mate by. Because if not, you wouldn't be in front of him if it wasn't for that undercut. Yeah, I personally think you guys are being very tough on McLaren. I think if you see where McLaren were a year and a half ago and where they are right now, it's something to admire and something that only them have achieved with the way that they've developed the car, developed the team and put themselves in a position to even be considering fighting for the championship. Whether they will win it or not by seven points, those seven points might be somewhere else, not only in the event of Hungary, might be because they started the season further behind maybe than what they wanted and not in that exact race from Hungary. Personally, I admire a lot Andrea Stella, the way that he's handling the team, the way he's handling every situation, how calm everything looks in McLaren, even if you guys are pushing them to fight for bigger things. But I think they are in the right trend and right now they are the strongest team in Formula 1, so hats off to them. Yeah, I guess on a personal level, it's been a season full of ups and downs, as I think anyone here can say, but some very good ups at the beginning with a competitive car that was allowing me to fight for a lot of podiums, a race win, and I truly enjoyed that. And I wish we can get ourselves back in that position as soon as possible. On the personal side, it hasn't been easy having to deal with, first of all, having to miss a race, but mainly with all the discussions about my future going on in the background. I've said many times it's not ideal for any athlete sitting here right now to perform at the highest level of their life without knowing where you're going to be next year. Yeah, I do believe there's still potential inside me, whether… If I take this out of my head, but given the circumstances, I think I've been performing at a good level with everything that's been going on. And I'm still enjoying myself every weekend and trying to be grateful and appreciative of the position that I'm in and just trying to nail every weekend and go into each race like it's the last and in the meantime having to handle everything behind the scenes about my future.
VB: it's been challenging year for us it's. we still haven't scored a single point which wasn't the target going into the season. So we wanted to see an upwards trajectory, what's the word? Yeah, trend in the performance from last year. And it hasn't happened. And we started the season with not that easy car to set up. And even by the pure pace, we were not quite there. We've made some improvement since, but more like baby steps instead of big jumps, unlike some other teams around us. So we definitely have a clear direction. for the second half where we need to improve the car, but that's just now what we need to do. We need to make it faster. And a lot of that obviously comes from nowadays from the wind tunnel and the design office, et cetera. But yeah, about my performance, I've been happy and my job for the remaining of the season remains to extract everything I can off the package every single weekend. That's my job. Obviously, two kilos is not a big change. The problem is when you start adding two kilos on top of another two, another two, another two, which I think is where the trend has been in Formula 1 over the last 10 years to keep adding two kilos here, three there, five there, and then the cars have become 800 kilos heavy. In the past, they were around 600. Work is going on, I guess, for ‘26. At the same time, I think this weight has made the cars also safer because there's a lot of impact structure and a lot of work being done on the driver safety, which I'm never going to deny that I want that safety to be as high as possible. But anything that we can do to bring the weight back down, I think every driver here will appreciate it. We hope that the FIA and the teams are taking that into consideration when deciding future rules, not only the ‘26 ones. Me personally, no. But I did have to be careful with the amount of muscle you put on and the food that you take. But I've always been on the limit of that weight. But I can imagine being a Nico, an Esteban, or who else is tall? Russell. I wouldn't be very happy if I was 180 something centimetres. So yeah, I understand it's been done probably for the heavier drivers because they were, or the taller drivers, because they were always struggling a bit more than medium size like me. My best option for next year would be a championship-winning car, which has been my number one priority since these talks about my future have happened. And the likelihood of that, we all know that is small, but that's always been my target. And if that doesn't happen, I'll choose what's best for my near future, for sure. I need to go and check, see what's out there! Raidillon. Absolutely no, sabbatical is not even in my head. I'm happy in Formula 1, I love Formula 1 and I would rather go down to a midfield team and use my skill, in the peak of my career, to try and help a midfield team to find the right way than taking a year off or being third driver for anyone, you know. I’m competitive and I know I can still bring to a midfield team that side of me. Yeah, I wouldn't say I would have ever predicted it. I think when I left McLaren four years ago, I did have the feeling the team was going in the right way and it was a very good place to be and I enjoyed my time there. So, when I left, I left with a feeling that it was more maybe a matter of time – it was going to take them two years, four years, six years to be McLaren again, which we all know how much success they've had in history. But I do feel they were the right people at the time to lead that team towards the front of the field again. And yeah, it took three to four years since I left. And especially this last year, I think, is when they've shown the real strength and the big steps, which have come in a very short amount of time, but very, very big. And as Daniel said, hats off to them. Do you honestly think I'm going to answer that question? After all this time, I'm now going to tell you if I'm going to decide tomorrow or in five days or before the summer break? I cannot honestly give you the answer, and I cannot answer that question. It's as simple as that. I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be before or after the summer break. I don't know.",Belgium,thursday,Ferrari
Kevin Magnussen,"I don't know about confident, but I'm looking forward to this track, given the nature of the car and the strengths that we've had this year. I think this track looks, on paper, pretty good for us. But as Daniel said, the midfield is so tight these days that it's super unpredictable where you're going to be. We've had races where we didn't think we were going to be good, and then we ended up being pretty good. Yeah, I think you can't take anything for granted right now. So just going in with an open mind again and try to do a good weekend. Well, I think we're still not consistent enough, but from last year, we improved consistency. Last year, especially in qualifying, we were able to be good, but every time on Sunday, we'd just fall to pieces. And I think we've changed that situation so that it's actually almost the opposite now. we look better in the race than we do in qualifying often. And certainly on Sunday, we're a lot more consistent. But again, with the field so tight together, it only takes a small little mishap and you're qualifying far off your optimal position. And that's been a big driver to the inconsistency this year, I think. Yeah, all of the above. I think everything is on the table in that case. So, yeah, it's hard to... I'll see what's available out there and make my mind when I get there. Right now, I'm in Formula 1 and there's still a couple of seats open for next year that I'd like to see where all that ends up and then look at things afterwards. I mean, it depends on the situation, but it would have certainly been tempting to hold on to it. But, you know, it totally depends on where you are with the team and what sort of history there is behind as well, I guess. I think coming into this year we thought we were going to be the last team on the grid and we haven't been. so I think it's been a positive surprise. There's always, when you look back at this stuff,  things you could have done better but I think everyone can say that, so I feel like we've had a good first half of the season. The second half I think with the couple of upgrades we've had this year, they've actually worked. And it's the first time in Haas' history that we brought upgrades to the car that made it faster. So that's a real step forward there already. So hopefully we can keep that going. I don't know. We're on a good trend, I think. So hopefully we can just keep that going.",Belgium,thursday,Haas
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, I mean, I think we improved the car a little bit the last few races for sure. Hungary wasn't our most competitive event. I think we were a bit better in Silverstone. I think we're better on the longer straights. So I'm hoping we can be good this weekend. Yeah, for sure. I'm looking forward to it. It's a great track. It's a place I always enjoy coming back to. And yeah, we've been quick on the straights this year, so hoping we can have a strong weekend. I just think we, you know, we’ve got to keep working on the car, making it better, putting on downforce, you know, working on the balance, just the usual things. So, yeah, just keep chipping away every week. Difficult one. Difficult one. Yeah, the usual stuff, you know, some good races, some disappointing ones. And yeah, you know, for the second half of the season, just trying to build on the first half, get more competitive as a team, try and score points week in, week out. So just keep pushing to the last race.",Belgium,thursday,Aston Martin
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah. Big thanks to this amazing crowd this weekend. And a huge congratulations to McLaren on the 1-2. That's my old, original family, so I'm really, really happy to see you, all the boys, the whole team, back up front. And then for us today, yeah, the team has done a great job to continue on with pushing this car. Ultimately, we didn't have the pace of the McLarens, nor did we have the pace of the Red Bulls, but we just were able to hold on at the beginning of the race. It was very, very tough to hold on, to make those tyres last. And obviously, the close battle we had at the end was a bit hair-raising, but that's motor racing. So I'm really happy. I'm grateful for the points. Big thank you to the team. It's not nerve-wracking. I think when you see the pace at which they close the gap in certain corners, you just laugh to yourself, because it's not something I can do. Particularly in the last sector, they were very, very strong, same as the McLarens. So, I mean, I saw him coming from a long way back, and he was able to brake a lot later than me. But he sent it up the inside. I stayed still, and he clipped the wheel and went over. So I think a racing incident, but, you know, yeah. Yeah, amazing. Congratulations to Oscar. He's been doing a fantastic job ever since he got here, to be honest, but he's been so consistent, and it was only a matter of time before he got a win, so this is a great day for him. He had an amazing pace from the get-go, so really, really happy for him and his family. The number doesn't, no. I just think about these two and how young these guys are. They were in nappies when I started, so… No, honestly, it just makes me think about the whole journey and all the great people I've had the chance to work with. You know, I got signed by McLaren when I was 13 and so there was always so much love for that team and through the journey that we had, where I had my first World Championship and then they went through a really difficult time so to see them back up there is really, really great. I'm really happy. You know that's my old family, so really, really grateful to be up here with them. And then ultimately I think it was a tough race today and I  definitely didn't think I would be having 200 podiums but what have I done? Like 340 something races? So, not too bad a score but I couldn't have done it without all those great people that I've worked with in both these teams. Yeah. No, I think, I mean, from what I can remember, obviously we passed a backmarker. I got to the braking zone, and then Max appeared, to overtake the car behind me, so I moved over to defend. I left enough room in the inside, but Max locked up, and he was going a different trajectory to me. I was going towards, around the corner, and he came shooting across. It felt like a racing incident. And it's easy to make mistakes like that. And so I don't feel there should be any hostility. But of course, from his side, there always will be. Well, firstly, I didn't know that. And it's not needed. This is Formula 1. It's always been like this. It's tough in these conditions. And we're highly-paid athletes. And you've got to train your ass off to make sure you can withstand the heat, ultimately. And it's tough. It's not easy, especially when you go to places like Qatar and Singapore. But I don't think we need an AC unit in the car. No, I think out of pure pace, we weren't. Unfortunately, we're still not, in hot conditions particularly… So you saw in Austria and here, we're not able to keep up with these guys. But in stint one, I was really surprised to see that I was able to hold on to Max. And I wasn't even having to push too hard to stay within a second, or around a second behind him. So I thought at that point that maybe I was in for a chance of at least fighting for that place. But then in the second stint, it was a bit of a disaster, it didn't feel good. And the true pace of the car started to show, I think, on those tyres. But we obviously got the undercut and track position is clearly key on this track. And I think that really ultimately made the difference.",Hungary,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Yeah, an amazing day for us as a team. I think that's the main thing, honestly. I'm so happy. It's been a long journey to get to achieving this on merit and that's exactly what we did today, and I think a long way clear of the rest, so we did it in style as well. So a good run by the team, and of course to Oscar. He had a good start, he got me off the line, and he controlled the race well. So yeah, it was coming at some point, and he deserved it today. The team asked me to do it, so I did it, and yeah, that's it. For sure. I mean, definitely as a constructor, two good drivers and an amazing team. So absolutely, I think it’s still difficult, still a long way to go. And today was our day. Spa, it can change completely, you know. So we'll keep pushing and we'll try to do more of the same. I'm trying to think of a cool word. I don't know. Just great. Like, it's been amazing. I don't know. A very good weekend, all in all, from all of us as a team. Mistake-free. Great pace in the car. Probably this weekend, I think, we can say confidently I think we were the quickest and I think that's the first time this year I can confidently say that, so amazing. Our first one-two since Monza with Daniel and yeah, an up and down journey. But, you know, since one year ago we were struggling and the turnaround to Miami and from Miami to here. It's been incredible. So as a weekend, fantastic. And I'm very happy for us as a team and everyone that's part of it to reward them with something like this. I mean, I didn't give up the race win. I lost the race win off the line. so I know everyone is going to want to say that as a story that I gave up the race when I didn't. I boxed first and naturally you’re always going to undercut. So the team gave me this position and I gave it back. Nothing more than that. I mean, things are always going to go through your mind because, you know… You've got to be selfish in this sport at times. You've got to think of yourself. That's priority number one, is think of yourself. I'm also a team player, so my mind was going pretty crazy at the time. I know what we've done in the past between Oscar and myself. He's helped me plenty of times… I think this is a different situation. This is not someone helping one another. I was put into a position, and we were undoing that position change. But I mean, I'm also, and I get it, and I know a lot of people are going to say, like, the gap between me and Max is pretty big, 60, 70, 80 points or something. You know, if Red Bull and Max make the mistakes like they did today and continue to do that, and as a team we continue to improve and have weekends like we've had this weekend, we can turn it around. And it's still optimistic. It's still a big goal to say, yeah, we can close 70 points and as a driver, I can close 70 points in half a season. And then when you're thinking of the seven or six points that I give away, then... It crosses your mind for sure. So it was not easy, but I also understood the situation I was in and I was quite confident always by the last lap I would have done it. It depends. I mean, I've done this for... I don't know. I think I was put in this situation and it's not my fault that I was leading the race in a way. Simply the team should have just boxed Oscar first and we wouldn't even be having this discussion. So, it's not that. I think just as a team, maybe we could have done things slightly differently and I'm sure we'll talk about it. But at the same time... This guy here deserved to win today. He did an amazing job. He got me off the line and yeah, that's a very special feeling winning your first race and I say first race because I think you'll agree that it's his first race win and not a Sprint race. So yeah, I'll let him enjoy it. And you know, for us as a team and to have the win is an incredible weekend for all of us. I don't need to. I know what I'm going to do and what I'm not going to do. Of course, I'm going to just question it and challenge it, and that's what I did. Yeah. I was going to wait until the last lap, the last corner. But then they said if there was a Safety Car all of a sudden, and I couldn't let Oscar go through, then it would have made me look like a bit of an idiot. Yeah, then I was like, ‘yeah, it’s fair point’. And I let him go, two to go or something. And straight away, I let him go. So yeah, I mean, that's just your opinion of what you hear. But that's the same with all sports. You can make what you will of what you hear and what you think you know and that kind of stuff. But I know that I always was going to give it back unless they changed their mind on what they were saying. And they didn't. So all good. No. I mean... I didn't lose the win there. I lost the win off the line. You know, I had a terrible, not even a terrible start, just a bad start. Something happened on my second shift and I lost all my momentum. Oscar got to the inside and that was it. That was that. So, you know, I got put into the lead rather than wanting to. I feel like we made things way too hard for ourselves and way too tricky for ourselves. We should have just boxed Oscar first and things would have been simple, but they gave me the lead and I gave it back. So I shouldn't have won today. I didn't deserve to win because of my start and Oscar's good start and that's that. So I don't feel like... I know I was in that position for a while and 16, 17 laps or whatever, It's hard when you're in that position to give it back because you're there. And you're there and of course that went through my mind, seven points that I'm going to lose. But I think the real fact is I shouldn't have almost had them in the first place. I shouldn't have had them in my hands. So the team were right. And I stand by what they said. Yeah, then I look forward to it. I mean, I said at the end of last year that we were going to win races this year. I said at the beginning of the year that it was not going to be an easy one for Red Bull, and all of that's come true. So I think we've done an amazing job as a team. So I think, first of all, we have to give credit to the team for giving us a car in order to do that. We've won today, but this is the second win of the year. Red Bull have had way more wins. Mercedes have almost had as many wins as we've had. Actually, they've had the same amount of wins as we've had. So just because we won one race today and we've had a dominant weekend doesn't mean we're the quickest car. I think maybe two weekends this year, we've had the best car of the grid. That's it. People can come up with their own opinions and say what they like. But, do we have opportunities to maybe win more? Yes. Did we necessarily have the quickest car on those days? I don't think so. But yeah, when I think of that, when I think of what we're doing now, what we are able to do in the future, you know, in the short term and also long term after summer break, and we have more days like today, then of course. You would be silly to say no. But don't get me wrong, I know it's like 70, 80 points that I got to catch up. So I know a lot of people are going to say that there's no chance, but I mean, we're going to keep fighting and I'm going to give myself the best opportunity to do so. You know, especially when you see Max today and Red Bull, not performing so well, making mistakes, crashing. You know, you want to make the most of those opportunities and plenty more can happen in the future. So, yes, I think it's still on. I know it's a big stretch and optimistic, like I said before, but I'm not going to say no to the challenge and definitely as a team, we won't. And psychologically, yeah, I'm happy. I'm ready. I still think, you know, if you throw back to Red Bull Ring, I did nothing wrong in this instance. It wasn't my fault. So I'm ready to go. I'm excited. I'm ready to battle. And I'm looking forward to the battles that we're going to have. I think there's just a difference of simply just deserving to win a race and not deserving to win. I didn't deserve to win the race today. Simple as that. So the fact I was in that position was incorrect. I think that was a mistake from us as a team. I shouldn't have been in this position. And it was a strategic way to just play our race. So it gave me hope and it gave me that position of, ‘oh, I'm here now’. But I shouldn't have been there in the first place. I'm not going to talk about it because I shouldn't have been there. I didn't deserve to win. End of story from that side. But yes, it's something we always talk about before every race is our trust in one another, our honesty we have as a group. I think that's something that's allowed us to catch others so quickly to perform and outperform others so quickly to develop the car quicker. As a team, I think we have and have shown plenty of times between drivers, whether it has been Carlos and myself, Daniel and myself, Oscar and myself, that when things do go one another's way, we're there to help one another, you know? And today is a different day. It's not because strategically something's really happened and you're kind of just letting someone pass or something's going that way it’s that I shouldn't have been in that position in the first place. I shouldn't have been given that hope of I'm here, I'm leading a race. So I don't think it's a fair thing. But of course we're going to discuss it and there's going to be times maybe in the future where things are like that. But if Oscar's led the whole race, I don't want him just to... It's not fair, and I don't think that's how it should work, that he should just let me pass for me to win because I'm fighting for a championship. Maybe I'll ask Oscar, maybe he will! Maybe he'd let me pass! But today was his, and that should be it. It wasn't my race today. He drove better, and he got a good start, and that was that, so... Yeah, like I said, something we'll speak about as a team and we speak about all the time. Something we're good at and something we'll continue to do good at. Yeah, we were allowed to race. Maybe something would have changed in certain positions, but we've always been allowed to race. 99% of our time together we've been allowed to race. There's been a couple times when it's just been better to hold position and it's not been worth anything differently, especially when we're fighting for, you know, last year we were fighting for ninth and tenth and stuff like that, you know, for any driver, it doesn't really matter so much. On a day like today, obviously, it feels better or worse either way, but we've always been allowed to race as McLaren. We've always been able to have those opportunities, and I think mainly because we've always been honest with each other, we've always respected each other well. I think as a teammate, I want to... For myself, I feel like I've always been good and honest and happy and respectful for who I work with and how we can work well as a team. I believe it's a good trait from my side and it's helped me plenty of times in the past. So, yeah, we are allowed to race and into the future that will continue to be the same, I'm sure.",Hungary,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Very, very special. This is really the day I dreamed of as a kid, standing on the top step of an F1 podium. Yeah, obviously a bit complicated at the end, but I put myself in the right position at the start. And yeah, thank you to the team for an amazing effort, an amazing car. Yeah, it's a hell of a lot of fun racing with McLaren, so I can't thank them enough for giving me the opportunity to be in F1. And yeah, to now be winning together 18 months in is an incredible feeling. Yeah, it's a beast at the moment. Yeah, it's fast in every condition. I think today, you know, we had it under control completely. And yeah, an amazing feeling to just be able to manage the race like that with both cars and secure a one-two. I don't know when our last one-two was, but I think it's a long time ago. So incredibly happy for the whole team and nice to get my first one on the board. The longer you leave it, of course, the more you get a bit nervous. But, no, it was well executed by the team. Yeah, I think it was the right thing. I put myself in the right position at the start. And yeah, with the different strategy we had, yes, my pace probably wasn't as quick as I would have liked in the last stint, but I was still in the right position to make it happen. So yeah, well executed from the team. I hope so. Yeah, I mean, I think I've still got some things to work on, but, no, I'll enjoy the win when I can. And, yeah, the team's given me a great car, and I really can't thank them enough for that. And, yeah, I'm trying to do the best job I can, and I'm learning every race I do. So, yeah, I hope there's many more to come. I think yes. I think we've proven this year that we can be quick in any circuit, any condition. We're always there at the front. And I mean, Spa's not been the happiest of hunting grounds for us recently, but I'm confident we'll be strong. You know, we've got a car that's become a real all-rounder, so I'm super confident, and I think the rest of the team should be as well. Yeah, very, very special. A lot of Australian flags, actually, which was very cool to see. Yeah, it was an incredible moment. I mean, it's always special when you get to stand on an F1 podium, but it's a little bit nicer when you're at the top of it, so very happy. Like I said, an incredible moment that I've been dreaming of for a very long time. I said my first dream in my career was reaching F1. The second one is winning a race. Yeah, I'm very, very happy and proud and not just of myself, but everybody that's helped me get to this position. You know, going back to my family, firstly, of course. You know, it took a lot of big decisions at a young age to chase the F1 dream. It's very difficult to become an F1 driver by staying in Australia, so it meant some big decisions early in life. And, yeah, just very, very proud that, you know, those decisions have paid off and we've managed to make it worth it. And, yeah, of course, myself just incredibly happy to have achieved this moment. Very, I would say. I think the Sprint win… It was always a bit awkward, in my opinion. It's a win, but not really a win. This is much more of a proud moment for me than winning the Sprint. Of course, it was a special moment at the time, but now to have no questions, no question marks over whether I'm a race winner or not is a very nice feeling to have. And yeah, the emotion is definitely different. I mean, I'm sure it's something we'll discuss as a team. You know, the information I had at the time was Lando was boxing early to cover Lewis, and I was going long to cover Max, essentially, because I knew that he'd stop later, and I think we were just being very safe. Of course, that naturally gave Lando an undercut, maybe made things a little bit more complicated than it needed to be. But yeah, I'm sure that's something we'll go through. I don't think I was really concerned. The only thing I was concerned about a bit was if there was a Safety Car, then it would have taken the situation out of our hands, would have taken the control out of our hands. So that was really the only thing I was a bit concerned about. But, you know, we'd spoken about it at the timing of the stop that we would sort it back out. And, yeah, I mean, I had full trust in everyone in the team, including Lando, that we would make that happen. Yeah, I mean, I think the whole race, we were very evenly matched. I think the dirty air made a big difference. I think where I was in the last stint, I don't think it made that much of a difference. I think ultimately, I just wasn't quite as quick as I needed to be in the last stint. So I think that's something that I that I want to improve and, you know, I'm very, very happy with the result, of course, but in terms of leaving the weekend, you know, with the question of am I fully satisfied with my performance today? No, I'm not. And there's still things I want to improve. Yeah, I mean, I think track position made a very big difference today. And I think that's why having the start I did was so critical. Yeah, I think just ultimately, I didn't quite have the pace that I wanted in the last thing. And I still need to go and assess why that was the case. Yes, I would say it is. I don't think it's fully sunk in yet. And I mean, I'm not really the kind of person to get overly emotional. So, you know, I don't think you're ever really going to see that from me. But, no, it's an incredible feeling. Like I said, it's something I've dreamed of since I was a kid. You know, we've had a couple of opportunities through the last few races that we've come very close to. And yeah, now to make it happen is an incredible feeling. But I'm sure with more time, you know, I think in Qatar last year, you know, that didn't fully sink in until probably the season ended. And, you know, I think with this, it will probably be a similar kind of feeling. Yeah, it's just quite a cool feeling, but quite hard to, I guess, describe and know how to feel sometimes. The second one was…? Has the Formula E race happened yet? No? It's not happened? Yeah, I mean his influence has been massive on so many levels. I think firstly it's important to say from Mark and Ann it's been important on so many levels. I think behind the scenes they've done an incredible amount of work for me in my career, whether it was my junior career, getting me into Formula 1, working with McLaren, it's been a massive influence for me. I think there's always little tips and things like that. I mean, Mark had a successful career, The majority of it is about the bigger picture of things. And Mark obviously had a long and successful career in Formula 1. And I've said a few times, his hindsight of his career is my foresight. And he can keep me out of a few traps, a few holes that maybe he experienced in his career. His influence there is incredibly important. and you know I think also for myself. he's been in a championship-winning team for a lot of his career and I think you know not just for myself but for the whole team, that's a key thing to have. And the last question? The shoey is Danny Ric’s thing. I mean, I'm going to get roped into it because I'm an Aussie, but I don't know. I'll try and think of something new. No, I think that's gone and done. I know we did one at Silverstone last week, but I think we were a bit upset after the race there, so we needed some cheering up. Maybe we'll do one in the plane on the way back. We can probably pay the cleaning fee now. But no, I'll leave that to Danny Ric and that can be his legacy. I'll create my own.",Hungary,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"I am, yes. Very, very, very happy. Not an easy qualifying. Different conditions, like you said, but always ending up on top is the best part of it. Also happy, especially, for the team, a one-two is even better to see. So congrats to the team. I mean, it does, but we've already got confidence. So it's not like we need a lot more of it or we're searching for it, you know? I think we've come into this weekend and the last few happy and confident that we can do a good job and we have a good car to fight for pole, and that's exactly what we did today. So, yeah, like I said, a great job by the team. We've been improving every weekend, and to end up on pole today is sweet. I mean, we're in the best position for whatever the conditions throw at us. So I'm looking forward to it. Two cars at the front row, we can control it from there. So as long as we stay where we are, we'll be happy. I mean, I'm expecting to. So if I don't, it's not been a good day. No, the car's doing well. I feel like I'm driving well. So it's obvious what the aim is for tomorrow. Thank you. Cheers. I mean, always pole positions are satisfying, I guess. So yeah, good. I think great for us as a team. We're first and second. I don't know when we've last locked out a front row. But yeah, great run for the team and tricky conditions to do it in especially. So not easy, but always good fun around here. And same time, as much as the conditions are difficult, it's still fun out there. So yeah, some nice laps, especially my Q3 lap. I only had one set of new tyres. And we decided to put them on early just in case the rain came, which it kind of didn't. But it was still have a good enough lap to stay on pole, so happy with it. Honestly, it wasn't too difficult, apart from I think when the rain started to come back at the end of Q1, I think it was. Yeah, before there was the crash, that was the only time when I backed off probably a bit more just to be safe. It’s that time when you're like, ‘do I push and take the risk or do I not?’ But apart from that, honestly, the track dried so quickly. So as soon as it stopped raining, it was perfect. And yeah, it could push. I mean, the grip was high compared to yesterday. It was night and day. It was like two-and-a-half or two seconds quicker. So it felt a lot better today in general. The car came alive a lot more today than it was yesterday as well. So I think maybe that played into our hands a little bit. And then tomorrow it flips back to being pretty hot. So yeah, looking forward to it. As confident, I think, as we have been for a while, like both quali and races, we've been strong. I think our bad one is still, you know, it's been third or fourth, but our good ones have been chances to win. So definitely, once again, a good opportunity for that, for both of us and for us as a team to score some big points. And that's our target tomorrow. I mean, we'll get... We did have a front row somewhere, or we were just side by side at another time? Maybe Qatar, yeah. [To Max] You're coming over the back of my car? That's not very nice. The Bottas! Honestly, it's something we'll talk about, and the same as we've always done. We've always kept it clean. I think we've treated each other well and given each other respect, helped each other when we needed to. So, yeah, no worries from our part. A little bit of both. I still wanted to, just in case any hope was there, but I didn't really expect it to. And it's just, yeah, you just want to be in the running in case something else happened. But I don't think many people expected, like we're all on old tyres, I don't think anyone expected to go quicker, but it was just be there if we needed to be, that was all. We lost it in Q2, just because my first lap on the used tyre wasn't good enough. I did almost three quarters of a lap on a new tyre at the end of Q1, so I'll probably say that's where we messed it up. Bit silly, I think, and we went out on a new tyre at the end of Q1, just to be safe. But we were safe anyway. So we boxed, and I did pretty much a whole lap on a new tyre, which meant my lap in Q2, on a pretty much full lap used, was never going to be fantastic, comparing to others on a new, which meant I had to put on another set of new on for Q2, run two, and I lost it there. So, I mean, after what happened, and in hindsight, I would say I'm not going to complain about it, but I should have had two sets coming into Q3. Obviously, it's worked out. But if it didn't work out for whatever reason and I made a mistake on my first lap, I would have been a bit more unhappy, the fact I didn't have two sets for Q3. So, yes, something we'll review. Just it was, I mean, it's going to go green at some point. So like we do in every single run, you always wait at the end of the pit lane sometimes. And yeah, nothing extraordinary. It's just normal. Just didn't want to be at the back. And in case someone had a slightly fresher tyre and whatever, didn't manage to complete the lap before, maybe they had a fresh tyre, that strategically you want to be at the front and not give them a chance. I mean, I don't think it's, like, important. Every single quali is important. Every race is important. So it's not all of a sudden I need to do it and I need to prove my point. I don't. We've done the best we could in every race. I think we've shown great pace and great opportunities. And I know we've missed out on some. We don't need to get back into all of that stuff. But yeah, I would love to have a clean, strong weekend. From yesterday already, we were very strong in the beginning in FP2, FP3 quali now. So it would be nice, yeah, just to have a nice Turn 1 and see what happens from there. But I'm not expecting it. I'm expecting still a difficult race with Oscar and Max behind. But every one is important. Every time we're trying to maximise every place, every point. And yeah, the more we can try to get back on Max, the more we as a team can get on Red Bull and other constructors, the better. So no point or emphasis on trying to beat a particular someone or something. It's just go out and do what we do because we're doing a good job. It's tough. I mean, clearly in terms of lap times, you've gone two seconds quicker than yesterday. So the temperatures make a big difference. The tyres just work better, pretty much. I mean, aero works slightly better, but the tyres just give you a lot more grip in these conditions comparing to yesterday. Obviously that flips again tomorrow. So lap times and degradation will probably increase again. It's hard to say what it's done exactly to the car. I'd say maybe the balance came together a little bit. As the grip comes up, the balance improves slightly and I think starts to maybe improve a little bit of some of our weaknesses. And I think maybe that's why our performance today was fractionally better than what it was yesterday, I would say. But when I say that, I mean maybe half a tenth or something. But when you look at the times half a tenth is all you need. So difficult to give an exact answer but just the car works better, the grip comes together, the car balance is more well balanced throughout the whole lap and that's always a good feeling.",Hungary,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it's cool to be here, especially when you get a result like this. I think the first one-two in qualifying for McLaren for a very long time, so very happy. Of course, when I miss out by two hundredths, you think of all the little things you can do a bit better, but an amazing result for the team. We had a bit of a tricky day on my side yesterday, so it was nice to bounce back this morning, and then obviously this afternoon in quali, it wasn't easy. A lot of decisions on the fly, and to end up with both cars on the front row is an amazing result. Not really. The first lap, yes, but the second lap, honestly, it was pretty good. I've already seen where I was a little bit slower, and then you think, ‘ah yeah, I could have done this a bit better, that a bit better’, but still a good lap. I'm happy with my day's work, and it's a long run down to Turn 1, so everything is still to play for tomorrow, and a lot of points are on the table. I mean, of course, I want to get into the lead, but, yeah, we have both cars on the front row. We've got a big task ahead of us trying to win this championship as a team, and we'll be smart. We've got a very quick car. It's been working extremely well this weekend, and, yeah, we want to keep it one-two, and I think we'll fight amongst ourselves for who gets one. Turn 4. In the first lap of Q3, I made a massive mistake in Turn 4. Yeah, it was just a pretty poor lap. And yeah, the last lap was pretty solid. Of course, when you cross the line and see it's so close you think of all the little things you could have done better. But honestly, it was a solid lap. There's nothing I would massively change on it. So no, pretty happy with it. Obviously, the car's been really quick this weekend and a good opportunity to win. Pretty smooth, yeah. I think, you know, the rain was a bit tricky at the start of Q1. You know, some of the kerbs were a bit wet and it was just enough rain that you couldn't actually improve. And then DRS got disabled and then… It was a bit of a weird session. And from that point on, it was relatively smooth. But yeah, not the easiest of conditions. Yes and no. I mean, I think FP1, there was good learning in that yesterday. I think we're starting from a great position tomorrow. So, yeah, I think maybe not quite as much as I would have liked, but I would say 90% of it, let's say. So, no, feeling pretty confident for tomorrow and see what we can do. I don't think I've started this high up at Budapest before. It's obviously a long run to Turn 1, and it gives an opportunity for the slipstream behind. Yeah, from starting fourth last year, I had a clean start and got to second. So I know that, you know, there's a lot that can happen at Turn 1. Bottas, as you mentioned. So let's see. I think, you know, I think get a good start and that always helps things. But it is a long run. And, you know, there'll be other people involved, I'm sure. Yeah, I don't really have much else to add. Pretty much exactly the same thing. I mean, it definitely feels nicer to drive when you're two, two and a half seconds a lap faster than yesterday. Yeah, I mean, yesterday was quite tricky trying to manage the tyres, you know, even over one lap. Yeah. you can destroy them in basically or could have destroyed them basically in half a lap. Today was a little bit more forgiving let's say, but tomorrow I think it's going to be much more like yesterday in terms of weather. So it changes the game a little bit",Hungary,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, I tried. The whole weekend I think we have been a little bit behind, and I think that was also the case in qualifying. I tried to make it as close as possible, but unfortunately, yeah, just not enough. A bit difficult to pinpoint why that is. Yeah, I would have liked a bit more grip, but it's not there at the moment. But P3 is still very close. I just hope that for tomorrow, of course, the car is good in the race, and at least that we can follow them and see what we can do there. Of course, I love competition, but I would like to be on top of the competition. And at the moment, I feel like we are chasing and having a few more difficult weekends. But, you know, I don't back out of a fight. But, yeah, we're just in a bit of a tricky situation, I guess. Let's see. I mean, the last few races, I think, especially McLaren, has been really, really good in the race, even compared to qualifying. So, of course, today was a lot colder than expected, I guess, with the clouds and a bit of the rain. Tomorrow is going to be quite a different day, and I just hope that that will help us. Yeah, it was alright, but not good enough. I mean, the whole weekend, just a little bit too slow. I mean, we tried to optimise everything, tried quite a few things, actually, with the car. And at the end, still too slow. So, yeah. That's what it is. I think that was good. The rain was coming in like little drizzles, so I thought it was good that we went out first. So yeah, that was all good. I mean, for sure they work, but we're still not first, right? So we need more. It's as simple as that. I mean, I think looking back at my qualifying, I was very happy with the laps, but yeah, balance wise, everything is really on the edge. I'm pushing as hard as I can. And then, of course, you have little moments here and there. I feel like I probably push harder than I did last year, but it's just not coming anymore to have these great lap times. So I guess it just means that we are a bit slower. So we have work to do. Simple as that. I don't know at the moment. But what can I do? I mean, we'll try our very best. Try to have a good, stable balance with the car. And I hope if I find that, that I can follow them. But I don't know. I mean, honestly, my long runs have been OK, but nothing fantastic or special. I think it's better to be realistic than sitting here and spreading false hope. But yeah, we'll see tomorrow. I mean, it's what it is. Well, I think it's more important if he misses it. I don't think he does, so who cares, right? I like Kimi. He's a great guy, but I'm also happy for him now that he's busy with his son go-karting, you know, trying to... bring up a new Räikkönen, it's great. I mean, he has done his career in Formula 1. Now it's time for the young one, time to spend time with his family as well. And yeah, spend more time on the go-kart track. So I think he is alright. We don't need to worry about him. No, I didn't want to drive anymore. I had no tyres, so they were used, so I was never going to improve. So there was no point for me to be in the pit lane waiting. It's been like that already for a while, so we are well aware of that. We are pushing as hard as we can, but clearly at the moment it's still not how we want it to be. We'll continue to do so. We'll try to find more performance, but I'm also well aware that that's not very easy to find suddenly throughout the season, with things already just planned, and just the way the car is. But we'll see. I mean, there are many races. There are a lot of things that can happen in qualifying with conditions, stuff like that. So we just need to stay focused and do the best we can every single time and optimise our performances. No, it's similar. Yep. I was the first car on track. So naturally, you don't have the effect of the wind around the track. But I think it's fine to be first on track. You have a clear track in front of you. Of course, maybe I had one or two cars that I had to go through in my fast lap. But overall, I think it was the right call. Same. I agree. I don't think we need to go into too much detail about that. It's just a shame for Checo, also himself, you know, that that happened in Q1, because I thought up until that point, actually, he was having quite a decent weekend. So, yeah, it's just very unfortunate. That's the only thing that I want to say about that. I'm not allowed to be frustrated? Yeah, that's what happened. It's just a different strategy to how others use their tyres throughout the weekend, probably. And yeah, we decided to then use the Hard tyre in FP3 to get rid of it and keep the tyres for the race we wanted it. I think it's fairly similar to a few teams around, some opt to have a hard, whatever, but I guess we'll see tomorrow what is the right call. We feel that that is the right way, but we'll see tomorrow.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah, it's definitely been good. It's been very positive. Austria was very good. Then we brought the update to Silverstone, which added more performance and was a good step forward. I think so far this season, obviously we're at the halfway point after Silverstone, that we're definitely one of the positive surprises this season, recovering a lot of performance from last year. So it's been good. It's very enjoyable, obviously, racing for points. We've had, I don't know how many point scorings now, but also a few times very close to the top 10. And obviously our ambition and target is to try and keep that up for the rest of the season. I think, yes, we surprised ourselves a little bit already in winter testing in Bahrain and from the get-go we found ourselves in better shape than what we could expect. I think it all goes down to some reshuffling of the technical structures we had within our team and the organisation. And yeah, it's just been good and, like I said, very enjoyable and positive. I think so. And it goes back to my point from earlier. We've been, you know, around the top 10 and competitive within the midfield and in the race for fifth fastest on many occasions. And I don't see a reason why it should be very different here. Yeah, I enjoyed working with him these two years. It's been definitely enjoyable. And we get on really well. After our little romance here a couple of years ago, it was actually quite the turnaround of a relationship and kind of turned into a friendship. And I think we work well as a team. We're kind of pushing in the same direction most of the time. And yeah, it's been nice and a pleasure. And I wish him well and all the best for his future. Yeah, I think it's pretty hard to implement motorsport and racing into the Olympic system, because also, obviously, it needs a lot of space. I mean, with karting, less. But if you talk real cars, tricky. I haven't thought of it much. Maybe yes, maybe no. Yeah, like I said earlier already, I think our aim… ideally we want to obviously keep riding that good wave that we've been on recently. That's not going to be easy. It's very fine margins at the front, but also in the midfield, you know, and a few tenths can put you at the back or in P9, 10. So execution, clean execution of every weekend, maximising, you know, your opportunities and chances is going to be key, very crucial. But I believe that we have a good, consistent package that will allow us to be competitive on any type of circuit that is coming. So, yeah, I'm looking forward to the second half of the season and to that final stint with Haas this year. I think definitely in the wet, you know, it adds extra thrill and excitement and difficulty for us drivers. Like you say, in the dry, a bit less so, especially Rouge. I think we have so much downforce and high speed that that's not so much of a challenge anymore. But since I've been in F1 in the dry, it was always more or less easy. But it is definitely still special. There's so much heritage and history in that circuit. And just the scenery will always make that and leave that special. Yeah, I saw it too. Obviously, it's a very personal matter, but I congratulate that. And if he's coming out with that, there's nothing wrong with that in modern times where diversity and everything is all to play for. So hate, there's always going to be hate in the world, especially obviously online. That's a place where people do and abuse it easily, where they can hide. That's not great, not fantastic. But other than that, yeah, all good.
OP: Yeah, I mean, I think it's great that he feels comfortable in coming out like that. I think that's what we want as a sport, to be inclusive for everybody and have people feel safe in coming out or whatever is in their lives. So, yeah, congratulations to him and I think it's a good thing. Not worried. It's going to be a difficult year, yes, for sure. But it's the first year of hopefully many and a long road. But obviously, seeing the first 12 races, seeing what happens, I often also see how these close margins make you look bad and make you have no points. So it's very specific and a lot in the detail. Sometimes misfortune kicks in. So I'm not worried or concerned at that moment overly. And I also know that, you know, in eight or 10 months, whenever, you know, the season starts next year, it can be quite different. So, you know, I'm fine and relaxed. Yeah, for the fastest and the strongest. You need two strong drivers and a strong team in the environment in Formula 1. So, yeah, whoever that is.",Hungary,thursday,Haas
Pierre Gasly,"Well, I guess I am now. We are, with Charles here. I must admit, it was an incredible experience. I've never seen and heard such an energy in a stadium. Actually, we didn't even talk with Charles before the concert. And it turned out we ended up in the same place, in the same area, without letting each other know. So it was pretty cool. And yeah, a good night. A good night. Well, I think we didn't even get a real picture of the performance there. Obviously, the qualifying was in mixed conditions. I didn't take part in it, and I didn't even take part in the race. So on paper, from the free practice, I did 15 laps the whole weekend. Yeah, it seemed to be slightly more difficult. We know the track, with all these long straights and the efficiency you need on the power and the aero side, maybe didn't favour our package, but I still think there would have been a chance to do something and it was just a shame not to be able to race. Well, first to take the start and actually race. But then I think the car itself, we know where we are. We haven't really developed over the last few races. So we know how to maximise it. Obviously, others, like Haas for example, are making quite big steps forward and it’s so tight in that midfield that it kind of reshuffles the order every time a team brings a new part. So I think we know we've got to try. Not easy to score points until we get new upgrades on the car, which hopefully will put us a bit more in the fight. I said it already. I mean, you know, I think Alpine, the team has good options on the table. At the end of the day, it's not up to me. I welcome the fastest guy out there. We all know who it is. But then, yeah, I mean, at the moment, we got to wait. But yeah, the team has three good options. I did my fair share of the job, but ultimately I believe in the projects we're building with Alpine and I always back the team up. Now it's up to him to make his own decision. Yeah, same comments to the guys. I just remember, like, Bercy, you see this footage from when the guys raced and that's pretty cool. I remember as a kid, I really enjoyed watching and finding it very inspiring to see Lewis… I remember all the big names at the time. I was a kid, and I found it very cool. So probably doesn't work in an Olympic type of format, but maybe a one-off race. Not even every year, but once in a while could be a fun event to organise. Yeah, that's probably it. Yeah, personally, it's always been one of my favourite race tracks. Obviously, Eau Rouge has changed. But even in lower categories, we have Formula 4, Formula 3, Formula 2 it has always been flat. So obviously, easier in Formula 1. But I still think, yeah, the track itself is just incredible. The flow, the rhythm through there is very unique. Longest track of the calendar, which also brings something quite special about it. So yeah, every track's got their own challenges. But I just love it the way it is, yeah.",Hungary,thursday,Alpine
Alex Albon,"It was good. It was good to kind of get another points finish for us. It was one of those races where it all just came together a bit more on a track that also suited us, which has suited us historically. So, yeah, you know, it was nice. Obviously, we're trying to catch up and overtake the guy to my right and at the same time try and create some space to Sauber. So we're doing the right thing and we're going in the right direction. But similar to Pierre, we're not putting things on the car. It's just getting the car in a good place for the one weekend that suited our car. It's been tricky. I think obviously we wanted more. That's also just a bit of a testament towards the midfield teams doing a great job. I think Haas, especially, kind of came into this year and have been a bit of a surprise and their updates are working and they seem to be continuing forward. The gap to the front has always been shrinking, it's just relatively speaking we've not been as performant as some of the other midfield teams. So it's still a race and it's still very close out there. One upgrade could put you back into the mix to fight for the points but at the moment that's not going to be on our car this weekend and we’ve got to focus on just maximising everything. We have low expectations. I don't think it's a circuit that should suit us. Kind of a little bit like Barcelona, hot, a bit more about pure downforce. I think it's a good test for us. We've come up with some new options and new ideas coming from Barcelona and thinking about how we want to address some of our issues. We'll just go out there in FP1, try a few things and see if it works. Yeah, I'd say the same. I wouldn't mind it. I don't think we would be the ones to be karting, though. I think there’s much quicker, much younger kids that would take it. Maybe Fernando not. I think he's still karting quite a bit, but I don't think I should be the Thai karter. I think there's quicker ones out there. But I love the concept of it. As these guys have said, it doesn't really lend itself towards an Olympic sport. But maybe just like Mazda MX-5s and everyone driving around. That would be a lot of fun. But that would just, I think it would be too fun. Yeah, same comments. I feel like, to be honest with Eau Rouge, after your first lap, it's not really a corner anymore. So, it's more about the rest of the track. And it has a great flow. I think they do the kerbs and everything well there as well. The undulations, the cambers, it's all much more how we like it, a bit more character to it. Big reveal. Here we go. Honestly, it's very much in the air. I think it is for everyone. I don't really care. Yeah, I think a little bit what Pierre said earlier, it's not really my job. It's not my point of view. I think if he's quick, that's good. We're in a midfield battle that every point matters, so we need everything we can get.
PG: Copy, paste.",Hungary,thursday,Williams
Oscar Piastri,"I mean, I think it would have been tough. I think at that point of the race, my options being the second car on track were always slightly unfavourable. I think in certain scenarios, yes, I probably could have won the race, but I think for a lot of people in that race, there are a lot of things they could have done a lot better, and I think a lot of people have a lot of what-ifs in situations like that. So, yes, I think we've analysed that and worked out where we could have gone better. And I think on both sides of the garage we've worked very well together to identify where we went wrong. But, yeah, I think the fact that we were in the hunt for that. I don't think we were… You know, before the rain came, we were not the fastest car on track. We were fourth and fifth. And, you know, through the weather conditions and whatnot we were able to get into a good position and unfortunately we made some errors from there. But I think the opportunities are always very, very tough to come by. And I think we're creating some of our own. I mean, a few. Obviously, a few specific to that race in particular. I think a few in general. I think as we're now fighting back at the front, we're competing against teams that have been in this position for an incredibly long time. In some cases, over a decade. It's been a while since, as a team, we've been regularly fighting in those positions. It's not an excuse for us to be able to get it wrong, but we are inexperienced compared to some of our competitors. We're learning a lot as we go along. I think we've had a few races where we've really taken advantage of our opportunities and maybe they haven't been commented on as much, but I think that's part of the game. When you're right at the front, these missed opportunities can be the difference between winning a race or finishing second, which, of course, has a bit more weight than if you're having the difference between a P6 and a P7. I mean, a few ways. I think the fact that we're even having these opportunities in the first place is, you know, we've been having opportunities for the last couple of months now, let's say, but our memory is not that short. And, you know, it was only 12 months ago that we were finishing P3 and P4 and that was an incredible result for us. So I think we still have that. Of course, we can't live off that forever and we need to appreciate that we're in a much different position now. But also the opportunities have always been very different. And some of the circumstances have been in our control and I think we've been very good at analysing that. I think a fair share of the circumstances have been out of our control as a team. So I think you know just focusing on what we need to improve for ourselves and not being caught up on the things that are out of our control, that's a massive part of it I mean, more or less the same as what Fernando said. I think with motorsport being so unique in terms of the car and the equipment and the team around you providing such a critical element, it's very, very difficult to even that out 100%, on any playing field. And I mean, I think a good thing about our sport is, yes, of course, we take a lot of pride in representing our countries, but I think we take a lot of pride in that in most cases, the best of the best, regardless of your nationality or your background can make it to the top. So yeah, I mean, I think it's a cool idea in theory, but I don't know how you'd do it in practice. I don't think the approach changes, no. I think for the majority of things that we've been doing in our approach, it's been working well. I mean, of course, you learn things on the way, but I don't think it revolutionises the things we're doing at the team. I mean, it would be nice to be close. I think we've come close a couple of times. So I think from a performance point of view and I think from a driving point of view, I think we're doing the right things. But with such a tight battle at the front now, you know, there's really four teams involved, it's really not easy to get it. So, I feel like it could be close but I want to still make sure that I'm learning every weekend and coming out the weekends happy with what I'm doing rather than focusing purely on the results. Yeah, I would say the same. I think the first time you go up Eau Rouge, it's always very, very special, no matter what car you're in. And for me, it's still my favourite track of the year. And like Alex said, not much of that is to Eau Rouge. It's for the rest of the layout. It's a very fun circuit. You know, in the junior categories, it was always quite good for racing and should be in F1 as well. And just a nice flowing layout. And, you know, let's be honest, there's never really going to be a track like Spa again, through the middle of a forest and I think that definitely adds to the atmosphere of it and the undulation and stuff like that. We're not going to have racetracks like that again. So I think that's why it's so special. Yeah, I mean, I don't think you need to be a works team to win an F1. I mean, as Fernando said, I think there's still definitely advantages of being a works team, whether that's from developing the engine how you want it and fitting it into the car exactly how you want, stuff like that. There's always going to be advantages as a works team, but I think now in the cost cap era of F1, I think it's got much less significance than it did. So, yeah, I think you can be a customer team, so to speak, and, yeah, put up a really strong fight.
NH: Same, same. I mean, the last time our motorhome, well it caught fire last time, I think Lando put it on pole, so maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's good! Obviously not, but it doesn't change much. We've unfortunately got the experience of having to rearrange things a little bit. So we'll be fine for the weekend. Yeah, I don't know if this motorhome we've got is now a bad omen and just, I don't know if it's a sign that we need a new one or what, but no, we'll be fine. In McLaren, we have two smaller rooms. So the downstairs one, most importantly, the one with the air conditioning is good. So for this weekend, we're sweet. The upstairs one, I can't use those. But I have one, so I'll be fine. Yeah, I mean, I think for me, obviously, I have nowhere near as much experience with Andrea in other capacity or just with other people in Formula 1, but I think we say it all the time at McLaren: he's an incredible team leader for us. And I think in some ways, because I'm still relatively new I probably don't appreciate fully the extent of his leadership and expertise as well. But even without that experience, it's very obvious to me that he's an incredible person, as Fernando said, and an incredible leader. And, you know, I think, firstly, you only need to look at the results of the team and the turnaround of the team to appreciate that, but on a personal level for me as a driver and just getting to know Andrea in these 18 months, for me it's very clear why we've been able to turn around and the empowerment he gives to everybody in the team… I know he doesn't like to take too much of the credit for the success of McLaren, but the power that he gives to the other thousand people in the team is really incredible. Yeah, he's a very good person to have around. A little bit, yes. I mean, it's certainly still not a completely different car to what we had last year in terms of how you need to drive it. Some things are improved, yes. I think at the start of the year especially, we were still struggling quite a bit in a few areas that were making the car a bit difficult to drive. It's still not a an easy car to drive, let's say, but I think every team has their own challenges. I think in some ways having a car that's quite familiar from last year still is potentially a good thing. Of course there are always things you want to keep going on and improving, but the car doesn't feel completely different and, you know, you don't drive completely differently from last year, just it's a lot faster, which is, of course, what we want first, and if we can make it behave a little bit more to our liking, then that's a bonus as well. I mean, I think we're confident in our whole team, drivers, car, everyone around us. I think we've got a lot of confidence. We've scored the most points of any team in the last six races. And, yeah, I mean, we're making up ground on everyone around us. Obviously, the gap to Ferrari now in the Constructors' Championship is very small. We're reducing it to Red Bull. Of course, at the moment, it's really only Max scoring most of the points there. I think we can't take for granted that it's always going to be like that. And we need to still be maximising what we can do to score the most points for both cars. But I think we're definitely confident that we're in the fight. I think it would be incredibly pessimistic to not be optimistic of our chances later in the year. So, yeah, I mean, we know it's not going to be an easy task, of course, and things can turn around very quickly. But, yeah, we're making the right moves at the moment and making good progress. So I think we're definitely in the fight. I'll be honest, I have not paid much thought to it. I mean, it's obviously very cool for Tom to have that achievement in life and I think adds a pretty unique perspective for a race engineer to be a former athlete themselves. You know, there's not many people in the paddock that can say that, I guess. I've been rowing with him before. For him it went well, not for me. So yeah, I mean, I can see why he was so good at the Olympics. But yeah, I think it does add a unique perspective. Yeah, I mean, obviously proud of his achievements and what it can bring to the table, I guess. Not much rowing techniques translates to driving, but I think definitely from the mindset point of view, it's a very interesting thing to have.",Hungary,thursday,McLaren
Fernando Alonso,"Well, the whole country enjoyed for sure. I mean in tennis, we had an incredible run with Rafa Nadal for many, many years – two decades in the top spot – and now with Carlos. So, yeah, I think we are in good hands there. He's very young, very talented. And, yeah, I think that the whole country is enjoying every time he plays. And also in football, obviously. It's only every four years or every two years when there's the World Cup and, yeah, it was a good match on Sunday. I really enjoyed. And, yeah, I wanted to win this one because, obviously, when you come to the race weekend, again, with all the mechanics and everyone in the garage, it's much better like this. I didn't speak with anyone yet. But yeah, I think tomorrow, when the pre-practice starts, we will close that page. Well, I think it's quite difficult to have the car in the right window at the moment for us. We're struggling to maximise the potential of the car. I think in Barcelona, we started the weekend on the wrong foot, and we could not recover from that bad FP1, let's say. In Austria, with the Sprint weekend, you only have one free practice. And yeah, again, we didn't optimise the package. And in Silverstone, yeah, we had a little bit more normal weekend. It was a little bit cooler as well, which probably did help our performance. And yeah, let's see here. It's another hot track, maybe similar to Barcelona in terms of corner speeds and things. So it's a challenge for us. It has been tricky. Yeah, I mean, up and downs for everybody, probably. But we started quite strong, I would say. The first four or five races, we were quite competitive, especially in qualifying, close to Mercedes and even to McLaren sometimes. And then in the race, we were going down. But, yeah, the last four or five weekends has been even more difficult than that. So, yeah, we need to improve our performance, we need to raise the level and get back to a more comfortable position. I think we represent our countries in a way every two weeks. This is not an Olympic sport yet, but ideally it will be nice to have it in the future for sportsmen and racing drivers to have the possibility, but I think it's quite unlikely because we have the machine with us. Even if you try to organise a go-kart race with exactly the same go-karts, it will never be exactly the same, probably. So, yeah, it is a very unique sport. Difficult to say. I think it depends a little bit track to track and it's very close in the midfield. I would love to finish both races in the points and that will be a good sign that the new package is delivering what we expect. I think the top four teams are a little bit too far away from our reach at the moment. So yeah, I think we need to do smaller steps at the time and being in the points on both races that will be probably the target. Not me. No, not me. There is another Spanish driver, so yeah. Not me, for sure. Yes, similar comments. It has never been my favourite track. It's in the top five for sure. It's an incredible circuit, but I think I rather prefer Suzuka or even Silverstone, I think, for the modern Formula 1 cars. Maybe more fun. And yes, racing below 30 degrees doesn't make any sense for me. No, no. I'm OK with the new things. And yeah, when something is renovated for better and to accommodate the new standards, it's always a good thing. And yeah, you keep your memories with yourself. And it's OK. Yeah. Yeah, same comments. Congratulations to him. Total support from my side and I'm sure all the F1 community. And yeah, it's great that he feels good and we all feel good for him as well. Probably it is the case now with the budget cap. I think the works team cannot get into an unlimited budget or test programme or things like that. So everything is more regulated now. But there's still a lot of downsides to not to be a works team. So you can see it both ways probably. I mean, he's an incredible person, first of all, a great engineer and a good team principal now. He's a great man. And I think people that is honest and people that does things with common sense, normally in life, things will go well with them. I think, yeah, he's a great leader. And as I said, probably common sense will define Andrea Stella. And I'm not surprised that he's doing an incredible job. A few things, not only one. As I said before, I think the car is not easy to drive and it's a little bit unpredictable at times. So this obviously removes confidence to the driver, when you are not able to push and to trust the car that will do the same in every corner, in every lap. So this, let's say, inconsistency is something that is not great when you are behind the wheel, and I'm struggling more this year than previously. Yeah, and then obviously when margins are so tight and you are in a close battle for one or two points, sometimes you take more risky decisions. Sometimes you gamble on a strategy. Sometimes you risk more than what you should in the start or on a set-up choice that we went for. Instead of changing something minimal before qualifying, we change the whole car before qualifying because we know that with a current car in FP3, we will not be able to score more than one or two points, so you risk it more. So there are always consequences with things that you do when you are used to fight for higher positions and you find yourself just aiming for one or two points, sometimes you risk it all to have a top five or being out of the points is not a big loss. These kind of things we learn a lot during this season and probably has been our, or my,  personal biggest difficulty. I think our aim, and my personal wish, is to find the direction and to find a comfortable path into the development that we can go into winter period with some more trust of what we do and then having a more normal 2025 campaign. So 2024, as I said, the top four teams are a little bit out of reach, so we just need to concentrate on our own development, our own trust in the car, and get better for next year.",Hungary,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think what made the race was the beginning. I took the lead in lap two, and that's where I had my buffer. Then, in that first stint where I could eke out the gap a little bit, because I think after that we had to drive quite a defensive race. Lando and McLaren, they were very, very quick today, especially on deg, you know, it seems always the last few laps of the stint, they were very, very fast. But I think we did everything well. We drove quite an aggressive strategy, but luckily it paid out at the end. It was quite close until the end, but very happy to win here. Yeah, I mean, I had to do a bit of rallying on the straight. I had to go into the grass a bit, which lost me a bit of momentum. So then, of course, we were quite late into Turn 1, but then, of course, I was quite determined to try and get the lead. Once I was in the lead, I could look after my tyres a bit better, and that definitely made my race today. Looking at it right now, absolutely. Yeah, just managing the tyres. You know, they get very hot around here with all the high-speed corners, so you're sliding around naturally quite a lot. So it was, yeah, just a management race throughout. Well, it wasn't straightforward. I mean, at the start, I think it was quite critical to get ahead of Lando,  looking at it now. Of course, at the time, you just tried to do what you think is best and how it works out. And then I think also what was very important was getting ahead of George, so that first stint that I could eke out a bit of a gap. And I think that all worked well. Then I think we were quite aggressive on the strategy as a team with our pit stops. So I think as a whole package, performance, we had a good race. We really tried to maximise everything. But I do think that we're struggling a bit for the optimum pace, lacking a bit of tyre deg towards the end of every stint. So it wasn't a very straightforward, easy race. I mean, Lando was catching quite hard at the end. But luckily, it worked out that it was just enough. From my side, I can only, of course, speak about myself. And I think we are, of course, struggling a little bit for that outright pace, it felt like. Plus, I feel like we didn't have the best tyre life today compared to Lando. It just seemed like he could push a bit more in some corners. Of course, we were a bit upset at one point with the tyres as well, because he went a bit longer in the first stint. But yeah, we still optimise everything. I mean, I can't really say that we did something wrong in the race, but we just need to try and find more performance. It was good. I think the first launch was quite OK, and then I got a little bit alongside. I had to go a little bit on the grass, but then I think George had a double slipstream and had a good run around the outside, which he managed really well. And I think the three of us managed everything really well into Turn 1. Yeah, I mean, you know, looking at records doesn't really mean anything there. You know, you need to have a good car, strong car to be able to keep those kind of performances up. And I think at the moment we just need to try and find that little bit more, you know, to comfortably win. Because I think if you look at our last few wins, it's been more about just being there at the right moment, at the right time, making the right calls and being quite strong as a team, you know. No, no, no. I think I know his birthday present already. So it's either like a big mirror or some glasses, and it will be fine! It's OK. No, listen, I mean, it's hard racing for sure. If you turn it around, would I have done the same? I probably would have done the same. No, listen, you always try to squeeze it to the limit. I also really wanted to avoid potential contact, because you don't want to rub wheels and potentially damage your suspension. So you naturally leave probably a few centimetres extra. And that meant those few extra centimetres meant that I had to go a little bit on the grass. And also, luckily, with doing that, nothing happened. So it's all good. I mean, we still had a good run to Turn 1. For one year, because I think in 2022, we were not the quickest. Ferrari was the quickest. And last year, I think we were quite good. But I think Mercedes was actually quite decent at that time of the year. So yeah, that's been good for us, but nothing particularly amazing. So I always knew that it was going to be very close. And McLaren is just doing a really, really good job. They have brought a lot of good updates to their car, and it really just seems to work. And from our side, we have brought things to the car, but probably not as much lap time as what others have been bringing to their car. So now it's up to us to try and find a bit more, try to get that little jump ahead again. Because I think clearly today, we just lacked a bit of that outright pace, but also just when we had to push, we just couldn't look after the tyres like Lando, for example, could. So these kind of things are quite crucial on most of the tracks where you have a bit of deg. So yeah, we need to try and be better on that. Yeah, it's just fine margins that define the outcome of a weekend. Naturally in the race, of course, you can't drive like you do in qualifying. But I think the fact is that we would like to be a bit better because I think today we did everything well, but it's tight. We just won again from all the last races that we've won. So yeah, we just need to look into the details what we can do better. It all depends on what the teams are going to bring to their car. I mean, I cannot look into what they're doing at the moment. The only thing that I can control is within our team what we are going to bring. And that's what I'm focused on. Of course, you can dream about potential improvements from other teams, but that's just a waste of energy. So I'm just very busy on trying to optimize my package and try to make it better, discussing a lot of things with the engineers and try to find solutions to stay on top.",Spain,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Not could, should have done. I got a bad start, simple as that. The car was incredible today. I think we were, for sure, the quickest. I just lost it in the beginning. So, yeah, disappointed. But a lot of positives, one negative, and that kind of ruined everything. I know that. I can just work on it for next time. But apart from that, a good amount of points and a big thanks to the team because the car was amazing. I'm not sure. I need to look back and review. I don't know what I did wrong or if I was just slightly out. it was only a little bit to Max that I lost. It wasn't like he was completely alongside. It was more that George was on the outside and kind of had me over. So, yeah, fair play. Well done to Red Bull and Max. Another job done for them but a shame that we lost it at the same time. So bit frustrating but we'll work on it for next time. Yes. I mean, Austria and Silverstone, two of my favourite tracks in terms of performances and where we've performed well at. So I'm excited. You know, we're on a good roll. We're doing well. We just need to, I need to just tidy up a few little bits and we'll be on top. The race, not good enough, simply because we should have won today. I think to answer the question you asked Max, I think we had the quickest car. But I just lost it at the start, you know, and then I couldn't get past George for the first stint. I think we were quite easily best car out there today. I just didn't do a good enough job off the line. And then that one thing cost me everything. So from Turn 2 onwards, 10 out of 10, I don't think I could have done much more. And I think as a team, we did the perfect strategy. And I was very happy with what we did. But yeah, the one part at the start, the 1% elsewhere wasn't good enough. No, I mean, my initial launch, I think, was better than Max. The second phase, the drive out, was not as good. I don't know. I don't know anything more than that, apart from Max got alongside me. And let's say, if George wasn't there, I think I still could have kept on to first around Turn 1. But George had a run on both of us, so even if my start was one or two metres better, which I think was all I probably could have done, just the long run down to Turn 1, the slipstream from the Mercedes, on both Max and myself, was more than anything that I could have done. I almost think George would have led no matter what, even if my start was two metres better. In some ways, that's what happens in Barcelona. George got a good start and I couldn't do anything about that. I settled in. I had to take third in Turn 2 because if I break two metres later, I think I would have taken everyone out with me. I made the correct decision of backing out and letting George have it. I don't know. I need to sit down with my engineers and talk. Yeah, for sure. Because that was more a decision, an incorrect decision or lack of decision-making. We were definitely not the quickest car in Montréal. Mercedes was easily the quickest car. But today, we were the quickest. We had the best car. I had the best car out there. And I didn't maximise it. The start's down to me. doing what I get told and executing that. And without that, or with a good start, we easily should have won. Yeah, I mean, I made George defend Turn 1, which kind of won me everything from that point onwards. He defended into one. Then I could kind of get the cut back. And you can do that on all of these corners. They're quite wide. And once you kind of defend, you can easily get a cut back onto the following corner. So, I had him on the outside of three. I was quite surprised in Turn 4. But I had so much understeer in Turn 4 all day. And the Mercs had a lot of front end in Turn 4. He could carry a lot more speed in four, get back to the outside, but then I could cut back on Turn 5 on the exit and get him into Turn 7. So it was a good fight. It cost me a lot of time and hurt my gap to Max in the end. But yeah, it was pleasant, you know, it was on the edge, was close, bit disrespectful. I mean, I'm confident. every weekend we go into now, the car's performing extremely well. We're always there or thereabouts within a couple of tenths of pole, and that's all we can ask for. I think we need to bring something a little bit more just to make our life a bit easier. It's close, and now we have, what, four teams who I think can easily fight for pole positions and fight for wins, potentially. So it's a very different layout again. High speed, I think we have a bit to work on, comparing to Red Bull. Red Bull seem definitely a bit higher, better in high speed corners than we are. Potentially we're lacking a touch in that area but the rest of it is strong. It's been one of my best tracks in terms of my own competitiveness and my most successful tracks so excited to see all the papaya and the grandstands and have a good weekend No. It's difficult to say, I think. I mean, it's never a nice thing, honestly. People are always going to boo, I think, no matter what. You have it in every sport. You support people and you don't support other people. I think it's happened in sport for years and years and years. And Max is winning every race, so people are not going to like that. And it definitely makes the sport less exciting, but that's just because he's doing a good job. There's a fine line. I think everyone within the sport appreciates it and respects it. You have to. And I think everyone does. But people who don't know the most about motorsport are probably not going to be able to appreciate as much because they don't know what really goes into it and what it takes to be in a position and do what he's doing. So... Yeah, I don't know. You're always going to have boos is my thing. And I think there's a level of disrespect and respect in any version of disrespect. I don't think that's OK. But yeah, I mean, I'm trying to not dig a hole for myself here. I just think, whatever. I would say no. I think people appreciate what Max has done. I think people maybe should appreciate more. But every driver is going to get boos at some point. I mean, it's always difficult to judge in that situation. I can't get a tape measure out and measure it perfectly. I'm not going to make his life easy. There was enough space, I think. What? I'm just going to stop talking. I think it was just racing. I gave him enough space. I don't think at any point there wasn't enough space for him to stay on the track. What? Do you want to answer it? OK. No. I mean, I gave myself a good four five four laps of tyre advantage. It's impossible to know. No one can say whether it's the correct or incorrect thing. It made my life much easier to overtake George, you know. I  still had to overtake George is my point. I was racing George until halfway through the race. And once I kind of passed him, then I was in my own race and trying to race against Max. So, no. I know people had the same comments about our strategy last weekend in Canada on the second pit stop onto the slick tyre. I think our strategy was better. I overtook George. I overcut him. And he got past me because he was quicker, not because of any other reason. So... No, the team did a good job. The strategy is very strong, has been for a lot of the year. We made a couple of mistakes here and there, but no, I think today we're probably the best strategy, so I'm happy with that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Max is not making any mistakes, really. So I think as soon as you make one little mistake, they're going to be ahead. I think, honestly, if you look at it yesterday, they probably had a slightly quicker car, in my opinion. Could be wrong. But in my opinion, I think they had a slightly quicker car. Today, we had the quicker car. But obviously, I still managed to finish second. So it's about the smaller things at the minute. But every track is a bit different. Like we've seen Red Bull struggle a little bit more a few races ago. I think we're still proving to be one of the most consistent teams at every track that we've been to. Mercedes were quick as last weekend in Canada, and now probably a little bit behind here. So it's a little bit up and down. And I think we just need to stay doing what we're doing, because it's good enough for the time being. But it's just trying to eliminate a couple of those small, little mistakes. I was feeling good at that point. It was more... could I close the gap in the amount of laps that I had? Which was always the bigger question and the question on my mind while driving. But I was good. I was comfortable. And the pace was very strong at that rate. It wasn't the longest final stint, so I didn't know if we were going to get to that time in the stint when I really start to catch. I think really like the last three laps, the gaps were pretty big in terms of how much it was coming down. Yeah, it's a hard one. I don't know if maybe I pushed a bit too much in the beginning and struggled a little bit more at the end. It's very difficult to judge these things. Difficult to describe, but I was feeling good. And I think... yeah I was confident in the car which was the main thing. I understood how to drive it and get the most out of it. So I think I'm still improving in that area. that's something I've not been super comfortable with and the knowledge of how do I extract the most out of this car. This weekend's been a very good step forward I think and hopefully I would have to carry that on into the next few. But yeah, I'm confident and those parts of the race I'm like, ‘OK I have clean air’ I can kind of push and as long as i hopefully get a couple DRS’s from back markers and hopefully they could help me out a little bit to try catch. I mean, I think so. I think we should have done better today. We should have got some points back on Max. Potentially, there was a chance to beat him in Canada. So two races that I finished second and he's won. But Max needs to stop winning in order to achieve that. Yeah, even though I moved into second in the championship, that doesn't matter. I couldn't care if I was second or tenth. It's more about the gap to what Max is and he's still extending it at the minute and that's something we can't afford to do or can't afford to kind of let him run away with it at this point of the season. But we can do. You know, if I just made some better decision in Canada and if I had a better start today, we could have won two races. And I know there's a lot of, and there kind of always has been a lot of ‘shoulda, woulda, couldas’, but we have what it takes. It's just about putting it all together.",Spain,post-race,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Yeah, it's been a good day, been a good weekend, a solid weekend. I have to say a big thank you to the team, because they've been training so hard in the pit stops. The strategy in the pit stops was really on point. Unfortunately, a bit like Lando, I got a really bad start and obviously lost ground to the Ferraris. So it was a bit of a battle to get back to where I am now. I think ultimately, with a better start, we would have... I don't know if we could have really held on to the guys ahead, but I don't think we would have been as far behind as we are today. That was the plan from the beginning. It was never an option to run the Hard tire for me today. So I drove the race to a Soft, Medium, Soft. Yeah, I think all the overtakes were super close. That's how it should be, right? Nice and close. I think we bumped wheels, but it was fair. I left him space. And it was right on the limit, but, you know, piece of paper between us. Yes, big boost to finally get a good result. It's been a minute since I've been up here in the race. So a huge, huge thank you to the to the team who have done an amazing job to… Just with all the processes through the race weekend but particularly everyone back at the at the factory for working so hard the extra-long hours to bring components to the car. and we're slowly getting closer. I mean last year we were very fast here but so you have to take it with a pinch of salt, but obviously the last couple of races we've also been relatively competitive. So I think we have closed the gap a little bit but we still have a good couple of tenths to try and find. So we just got to have all hands on deck and keep pushing. No, I think that's the maximum it's got at the moment. But I mean, we're always fine-tuning it with subtle changes that we make. So we are always fine-tuning it when we continue to tune it through the year. But we need to bolt some stuff on, some extra bits to be able to compete with these guys. I mean, look, it's never a a good feeling when you do get overtaken. And I think we had a nice tight battle into turn one. I left him some room, so I think he was still on the track. Ultimately, he left the door open on the inside, didn't fully close it. And so I went for the inside and tried to make the corner. I think he came around. I think we touched wheels equally and nothing major. It was like a small scrub. Gave him some room on the exit and yeah. We definitely are. We definitely are. We're definitely getting more consistent. And if I can just get my qualifying to be like this weekend, then it makes the Sunday so much easier. Also, if you get a good start. But my Saturdays have been so bad for the last, like, 15 races. So it's good to have a clean weekend. And hopefully, this puts us in a good position to challenge in the next few races. What was the question? Well, I mean, honestly, I'm not really a lot on social media or reading the news. So in terms of being like, I don't really, I'm not tapped into that to know exactly. But on the race weekends, he always has a huge crowd always. So he's always got amazing support. And at the end of the day, he does a fantastic job. Every weekend, he delivers. And he's got a great team and obviously a great car. But you can't fault him. I mean, it's not the... It would be nice. But I think considering where we've come from, I think... Yeah, I think just having consistency and seeing if we can put the team further up in the points, I think it's got to be the target. But I think right now, let's just try and have more consistent weekends like this and then we'll see. But we aren't yet currently in a position to be able to fight them for wins. You would say that maybe Montréal… I mean, George probably should have won that one, but if I'd qualified where I feel I should have, there was potential also there too. So we'll see in the next few races. I think we've got these high-speed circuits. You know, the McLaren's always been quick and the Red Bull has been quick in A1 Ring. Silverstone,  they'll also be very fast there but I'm hoping that we are able to eke a little bit closer to them and give them a bit more um trouble in the next four or five races. And then we’ve just got to keep bringing upgrades. We've got to keep improving the car. There's a clear improvement and there's just clear areas where we need to bolt on performance so that we can be in the fight with them. No, not at all. I mean, firstly, I love Mercedes. I've been with Mercedes since I was 13 and I'll always be a fan and supporter of Mercedes. And my job this year, right now, is to work as hard as I can with the crew that I have, with the people back at the factory to try and move and develop the car in the right direction. And so ultimately, whatever course and trajectory the team is on for next year, for example, there are things that I've hopefully been a part of and be proud of being a part of. My job will start next year at the other team who I think are doing a great job. I think they've had a couple of difficult races, but let's not forget they had a race win in Monaco. I can't tell you what is wrong with their car and why they are in the position they're in today. But they did bring an upgrade here, and I think they are definitely progressing. So yeah, but it doesn't make me second guess my decision at all. I mean, our pace is where we were basically, third and fourth to this weekend. But I think our car has generally been very, it's quite peaky. And that means that it's often out of balance. It's very rare that it's in balance and it's nice and smooth through a corner. And so set-up has been… I've obviously experimented a lot with the set-up over the last couple years but the car doesn't really like any of the set-ups but one, and it's slowly starting to get just become nicer to drive. And then ultimately, tyres. The tyres have been a huge issue for me. I think we got it half decent this weekend. If I can make some improvements over the course of the next races I think there's more performance there.",Spain,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"It was pretty much a perfect lap. You know you're on a good lap when you're getting excited but the whole thing went perfectly in the end. So, close, still, but super, super happy. One of my, I'd say, my best pole positions. I've not had many but out of the ones I've had, my best. We've been close all weekend, but really this was just about a perfect lap and that's what I did today. So it was cool, the fans and my supporters here are amazing, so a big thanks to everyone cheering me on. It's not. I mean, it's not just this weekend. You know, we've been quick the last two months. Since Miami, we've been very strong. And we probably missed out on a pole by just not doing a perfect lap. And today was the perfect lap. So I would say Max and Red Bull seemed a little bit stronger all weekend than we did. But we made some changes for the final run. I had some little places to improve and I did exactly that. So, yeah, super happy to be on pole. That's our target, but I know it's going to be tough against Max, against Lewis and everyone behind, but we're here to win now, so that's my plan. It feels great, yeah. I mean, poles always feel good, and it's the second one in my career. I mean, I've had two Sprint race poles, but I don't regard that at all as a pole position. So, yeah, this is the second one of my career. It's been a while since Sochi, all the way back then, so... Yeah, it feels great. I mean, it was an amazing lap. Honestly, it was my best lap by a long way. I pretty much put the whole lap together, so I got a nice slipstream. I think probably my best corner around the lap, every single part of it put together. Max was a bit ahead in Q1, Q2. I knew I had to kind of do something perfect in Q3 to do it. And that’s exactly what I did. So I'm pretty happy that I managed to pull off probably my best lap that I've done probably ever. I mean, I'm probably going to get back and Jarv, my engineer, is going to tell me that I've messed something up, but I think it's so tricky nowadays, with the car and the tyres, and we're pushing so much, just to put everything together. You might be able to do half of it once and half of it another or mix it up, but to kind of put all of it right at that limit is very tricky and I'm sure every driver would say the same. So very rewarding when you do and when you do it and end up on pole because of it, it's even sweeter. I think so. I mean, we're always close. I don't think any practice was split by more than a tenth between the top five. So I was expecting the same as that, and I think it was. Probably Max was always two and a half tenths ahead of everyone, both Q1 and Q2 in the runs we did. And we did three laps, you know, we did three runs, four runs in the end altogether. So you do four laps throughout the whole of qualifying. But every time was like missing a little bit to Max and a lot of it was high speed. So I knew for the final lap, I've got to go balls out and do it, you know. And I managed to get that little bit, like that, you know, 200ths, 300ths, 400ths that I was needing to get out of Max I managed to get. So I'm happy the risks paid off and for all of it to come together when I needed it most was great. I don't have any concerns. I mean I'm excited. It's a long run down to Turn 1. It's probably one of the places you don't want to start on pole, but it's an opportunity for us to go out and try and win a race you know. We've not done loads of long running. We've done a bit and I think we were close, as it always has been. I think tomorrow is not like this car is way quicker. I  think between Mercedes, ourselves, Red Bull, Ferrari, there's eight cars that could have probably been on pole today and that have a chance of probably winning the race tomorrow. So it's about making the least mistakes, similar to today, and just trying to execute another good race that we normally do. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, first of all, from that side, the best thing is everyone’s safe, everyone's doing well. Yeah, so that's probably the best news from everything. One person was taken to hospital just for some check-ups, but all good otherwise. So a bit of a scare for the whole team, never a nice thing. But just a bit more of probably a stressful day than I would have liked. Yeah, I lost my shoes. That was probably as bad as it got for me, honestly. I mean, yeah, just different. I mean, I've not been in my normal room. I've not been able to maybe relax and chill out as much as what I normally do. I've had a lot of offers from people, so it's been great. But a lot of the teams, honestly, have been very, very nice to us, McLaren, in offering help and things like that. So that was all good from that side. But a shame that it won't be used today or tomorrow, I don't think, for anything, maybe not into the future, but that's not anything that I know about for now. So that was that. And from the team side, from the final laps, I mean, just the two high speeds, so Turn 9 and the last corner, the two where... The car's moving around, it's bouncing a little bit. It just doesn't fill you with confidence going around such a corner when the car's doing those things. It can be quite unpredictable in such a high-speed corner. It's a bit nerve-wracking to commit and know when to take the risks. Over the weekend, I took risks in pushing and running into the gravel a few times and damaged the floor a little bit here and there. I've been pushing the limits, I'd say, the whole weekend, but maybe not as much in the very high speed, where the consequences are more. But when I looked at the data after Q1, Q2, I was losing probably a tenth and a half, almost two tenths, just to Max in two corners. And that was just the two corners where I was least comfortable, but it was just about kind of committing and hoping I came out on the other side in one piece. And for that final lap, that's exactly what I needed to do, and it's exactly what I did. We made some small changes for the rest of the track, but nothing to do with 9 and 14. That was just whether I wanted to take the risk of kind of pushing that bit more and trying to get that little bit that I needed for a pole. I mean it's all been a little bit messy but I think I have one or two sets of everything and I think they managed to get some stuff out but some of it's probably not the best to use or it smells pretty bad from the fire. Some things I got out, but I like to listen to my music and stuff before and Oscar complains a lot because my music's so loud, pre-sessions. But I just didn't have that this time and I'm up in the engineering office and Oscar's down in the truck below. And that's Zak's office that I've taken over. So now Zak's a bit unhappy that Zak's in there. Honestly, nothing's been an issue. And I've never been that guy to kind of complain about these things. Honestly, I could just be doing nothing and just jump in the car when I need to but when you have an ability to kind of have a few minutes to yourself and a couple of those things, you take them, because you want to just relax and think to yourself for a few minutes before you go out and do it. Nothing for today. Maybe tomorrow will impact me a bit more that I can't get that quiet time that that I love. But it's not the end of the world, so I'm not going to complain about it. I mean, I hope not. I hope I can have just a good start and kind of control it from there. But I'm sure the whole race I'm going to be under pressure and going to have to make those kind of calls. But, yeah, I mean, I look forward to it. I look forward to racing against anyone. And probably Max is the guy on the track that I've raced the least, just because he's always been too far ahead. Yeah, happy to now kind of be there and I'm sure whether I'm first or second tomorrow coming out of Turn 1, it's going to be a fight till pretty much the end of the race. So I'm excited. I look forward to it. I've not had many opportunities to do so. When I have, he's normally been about a second lap quicker, but that's not the case anymore. So yeah, I'm excited to just race against him and have some fun. I mean, certainly from a team side, absolutely. It's the best the car's been. So when the car's good, then you've got to be more confident. And yeah, I mean, Imola, like you said, Canada, I think we should have had a better chance and we didn't do the best of jobs, but we should have had a better chance. Certainly there's been enough opportunities now to probably fight for a win or the fact that we had the pace to win a race. So 100% from a team point of view and I think… I mean I said at the beginning of the season we were going to win and we were going to fight against Red Bull and that they weren't going to dominate like they had done and it's turned out exactly to be that. which is I think good for everyone, including everyone watching. But we have more to do. I don't think we had potentially the best car out there today. I feel like I did a perfect lap and was only just about on pole. But it's very difficult to know. I think everyone in the top 10 is at such a high level that it's probably hard to differentiate what the differences are between what drivers are able to achieve. So from that side, absolutely. From a personal side, I would say so. I think I've commented in the last few weeks about just not having that ability to kind of unlock something more come qualifying and find a limit and just get a bit stuck. I just found it hard or very difficult to progress a lot through qualifying and kind of just get into a nice flow and a good rhythm. So we've been working pretty hard on the simulator and with my team on trying to improve on all of these things, because comparing to others, comparing to Oscar in areas, I just wasn't comfortable and I wasn't confident that I was able to go out and just do what I needed to get done. But this weekend, I kind of come in with a different approach and reset some things and definitely I feel like I've been on a better footing. So I have been. I've been confident. It's not often I say that, that I've been confident. But the last couple of months, the car's been performing well. It's a bit more to what I want. Definitely not where I need it and where I am so most confident, but we're working on it. And I think it's all credits to the team because without the car that we have today, I wouldn't be on pole. All driver! I was joking! I mean, you need a good car. I just don't want to sound like an idiot! He probably put that as the headline already. No, I mean, you need a good car under you. Like we've seen with Mercedes. When they've not had a good car, I'm sure Lewis and George have driven some good laps, but... Sometimes you do your best laps and you're fifth, tenth. I think when you go back to Canada, I think that's probably a little bit the driver. When it's so close, that's probably a little bit more down to driver and getting that last little bit out. I think today, and every day, is a lot down to what you can do as a driver. And my lap was perfect, pretty close to. Without that, I would have been second. So I feel like I made a difference today in executing a perfect lap. But I had a car which I had confidence in to get that lap time out of. It's a combination, like Max said. It's complicated. It's not as simple as you're saying, one or the other. There's so many factors going on. It's difficult to describe it to you guys on what it's like.",Spain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think in qualifying it was all coming together a bit nicer. The whole weekend we've been trying to find a bit of a connected balance because in all the practice sessions it was very difficult. So I was quite happy in qualifying. I mean, even in Q3 I got a nice little tow from Checo to Turn 1 to really extract everything we could and unfortunately it was just not enough. But that is how it goes sometimes. I think overall we can still be very happy with this performance in qualifying and it's definitely all to play for tomorrow. Yeah, just by chance. I didn't even know initially where Checo was on the lap and then they told me where he was so I was like, ;I'll try to hang on to him’. And yeah, besides that, with the temperature, I do think it was a bit more fun in qualifying. But even I think throughout qualifying, the wind started to pick up a little bit. Maybe that made it a bit more difficult for us in Q3, but overall a good performance again in qualifying. You know, at the end of the day, they're never really easy poles because you're always in a battle with yourself. But, of course, now it's with more teams, and I think that is good for Formula 1 in general, and, of course, when it's always that close for a pole position, I think that's always great. The lap itself was good. I mean, I even also got a tow to Turn 1. I think in general, when you look at it, the whole of qualifying was just miles better than practice for me. I always felt like the car was not really connected in all the free practice sessions. So when I went into qualifying, it just clicked much better. And I think in the very high speed, we were particularly strong around the laps, with Turns 3, 9, and the last corner, which were quite comfortably flat. But I guess in a way probably that's why we were not improving that much in the final few runs because those corners are flat, so there's nothing to gain, and then there are not that many corners left around the track. So I did make my gains but I probably was already flat where maybe Lando wasn't flat before and then you just lose out a little bit with that. So maybe a bit too draggy for qualifying, looking back at it, But that's something that is always very easy to say afterwards because the whole of the weekend we were just sliding around too much and now probably it was finally hooked up and you probably would have turned down the wing a little bit, but that's how it goes. No, we made some set-up changes again to the car and it all just felt a bit more normal. I think it's been OK, but not good enough, clearly. These kinds of tracks, I was hoping, of course, to be ahead. But the other teams are catching up. We've seen this already in the last few races, so it's definitely a lot harder. We need to do everything perfect to be first. We just need to bring more performance to the car. Yeah, you do. But I would always want to start first. It's a bit easier to defend like that. I think our top speeds are all quite similarish and we don't have DRS, of course, into Turn 1 with the start. So again, it all depends on how good your start is going to be. It is such a long race, so many laps that you have to do on these tyres around here that anything can happen. Yeah, honestly, like it's easy to say now. Of course, we ran the big wing. But up until qualifying, it was just the car was not stable enough. So I think we did fix it. And then also, probably with the conditions becoming colder and colder, you just run out of basically corners to make a difference because some corners become flat out because of that. And then, yeah, you become a bit draggy. In terms of wake-up call, I think we are pretty much very awake already with what's happening. So, yeah, we need to push on. We need to bring parts faster, better. I mean, we've had a very dominant car last year. That is very, like… I mean, it's completely gone, naturally. And, yeah, we just need to really try and make a step ahead again. Clean. We had no issues from what we've experienced in the last few weeks, but it took a bit of fine-tuning and to get the car quick, I would say. But I don't feel like it's always you know just fine-tuning. Sometimes also it just seems like we are lacking a bit of pace. So we need to yeah just try and be more competitive. Yeah, I mean, for sure I would like to win tomorrow, naturally. I think it's still a bit unknown where we are, like all of us, in terms of pure pace in the long runs. I'm hoping, of course, it's going to be all very close, like it has been in the last few races. And I think, yeah, with the high deg around here as well, you need to really look after your tyres. I don't know, of course, in what state the track will be as well tomorrow with potential rain, of course, overnight and in the morning. So all these kind of things, of course, come into play. I mean, there's so many good drivers out there, right? Of course, you know, naturally, I think sometimes you hit a better lap than other times. That's how it goes in life. But, yeah, I mean, there's so many… I think if you look at it, I think there were so many great laps driven. But sometimes, for whatever reason, you know, it might not click or come together. Some cars, they work a bit better on particular tracks. But... Yeah, I mean, again, it might also be completely different tomorrow, right? I mean, one car might feel a lot more comfortable in the race on tyres or whatever. So we've seen that in quite a few qualifyings where, you know, some of the other teams, they're quite close in qualifying, but then actually in the race, they drop off quite a lot. You can also argue why is that, right? It's just very complicated, honestly, this sport, in general, to understand. You know, tyres are very crucial. And of course, that's honestly the only part that really touches the tarmac as well, right? So just understanding that already is critical. It's OK!",Spain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I'm really happy. Firstly, thank you everyone. So, so happy to be here and super grateful to be up in the top three. It's been quite a difficult year so a huge amount of work from everyone back at the factory and finally we're starting to see those incremental steps moving closer to the guys ahead. I didn't expect us to be fighting for pole necessarily but every now and then it looked like there were bits there and maybe we'll be close and so to be there I'm just grateful. Yeah, we've made huge steps forwards. And it's really just down to every single individual back at the factory who's pushing in design, pushing in making the new parts that we get to bring as early as possible to these races. And slowly the car is crafting into a racing machine that we can hopefully fight the guys at the front. So George did a great job as well today. So hopefully tomorrow we can apply pressure on the two cars ahead. I think it's been OK. It's good to be back up here. I miss being on this sofa, although it's not from IKEA. But generally, it's great to see that we're progressing. Really, you've seen over the last couple of races that we're slowly climbing closer to the guys up front. So I think there's a little bit more performance in the car today, but it's really on the knife edge. So we've got some improvements to make to the car. But yeah, as I said, I'm really happy to be P3, it is a pretty good spot to be in for the start with that long straight down to Turn 1. Three tenths off. Yeah, so it's a pretty big chunk. For a track like this, it's not too bad. I think, as I said, through the lap, there's a little bit of time, I think. It probably could have been two tenths, but still they have a slight advantage. But for us to be that close on the track like this is a real good showing that we're going in the right direction. As I said, we've got some improvements that we need to bring over the next few races in order for us to be properly in range of those guys. I think it would be very difficult. I think these two will be very quick, but position is everything so I think we'll… You know, also there's two of us, so hopefully we can apply pressure as a team to both of the cars ahead in order to maybe play out something in strategy and slowly climb up. I think it's all about degradation tomorrow and how you look after the tyres, so we won't know until we get into that first run. It was pretty decent. I don't know if it was as good as Max's, but I'll try and make it better tomorrow. I think the bigger concern probably is the Ferraris behind us. Obviously, we were all within half a tenth, I think, from third to fifth. I think it was fifth or sixth. And they had an upgrade this weekend, so I think their long pace look quite strong. So I think it's more working together as a team and trying to hold position at least. If we happen to have more pace available to us and we're able to hold on to these guys, then it's game on. But we really won't know until tomorrow. And degradation is always the key here. And when you have a really good rear end, you can save your balance, but you can save the rear tyres. So that's going to be key for tomorrow. I still feel like I lost performance going into the, you know… I still lost a little bit going into quali. It's all about perspective. Maybe they just moved forwards, but I definitely feel like there was a little bit more. But just as you start to push the car, it doesn't like it. So in practice, when you leave a little bit of margin, the car feels quite nice. But it's when you start to really lean on it to try and get that extra bit of lap time out where we really struggle. And I think it's all in the tyres. So you saw in P1, I was seven tenths down due to an issue with the blankets. And then we got it sorted for the following sessions. So, it puts you a little bit on the back foot. But yeah, otherwise, the car, as I said, it's good that we're up here and it's the best qualifying I've had this year, so I'm really grateful for it. I've not driven this car on the old track, but I think we've been relatively good in the low speed. So, I don't know, I think these last two corners are more enjoyable. The last corner is full gas at 280 or something like that kilometres an hour, which is amazing. And it's really, really challenging, on the knife edge, heart in your mouth sort of corner. So much, much better than the small chicane that we used to have. And I think it is better to follow and should provide better racing. I think it did already last year. So whether or not our car is as good as theirs in the high speed, I'll look at the data, but it's probably relatively close.",Spain,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a pretty crazy race. A lot of things were happening, and we really had to be on top of our calls. And I think as a team, we just did really well today. We remained calm. I think we pitted at the right time. Of course, the Safety Car worked out nicely for us, but even after that, I think we were managing the gaps quite well. Yeah, I love it. That was a lot of fun. Those kind of races, you need them once in a while. Yeah, in different stages of the race as well, so it was a lot of fun out there. Yeah, not particularly an issue. We know what it is, so we just need to work on it. But nevertheless, we won. That's the most important, and we still have a lot of room to improve. Yeah, it's for sure. It's very rewarding. I mean, it's never an easy race. It's easy to make mistakes, especially on the Inters when they were almost becoming slicks. It was very easy to go off because the track was drying in most places. But in some corners, it was still a bit too wet to go to slick tyres. And yeah, that made it just very, very difficult. Yeah, it's a lot of fun to drive these kind of races now and then. You don't want it all the time because that's too stressful, but I had a lot of fun out there today. I think, yeah, of course, you are very focused, but you try to remain as calm as you can be. And also, the communication to the pit wall and them to you, to ask what are the conditions. And I definitely think as a team, you know, we did make the right calls today. And yeah, that, of course, is also very important. Of course, it sometimes works for you and sometimes it works against you. So this time, yeah, it was working for us. So I guess in that sense, it's 1-1 now this year. But that's racing. It's a part of it as well. I would hope so, yes. I mean, yeah, the last few races have been quite difficult, but not only just difficult, too many problems as well, throughout the whole weekend. So we need to have a cleaner weekend. And yeah, for sure, like even in the race now, we're struggling a lot with the kerbing and the bumps. So we definitely have an area we can work on and definitely improve the car by quite a big margin if we get that under control. Well, I'll be flying home. Yeah, I just like the environment here. It's pretty relaxed and the people are always very nice. They love motorsports. Yeah, it's a great place, honestly. And I always love the track layout. So, yeah, it's a great track to have on the calendar and a great city also to visit. Yeah, I mean, there have been, of course, some drivers in the history that have done quite a lot of amazing things and have won a lot of races at particular tracks specifically. And, yeah, it's been a good track to us the last few years. So, of course, yeah, and actually it's great, you know, to have three wins in a row here. Of course, I hope I can add more in the future. But yeah, I enjoy driving here. It's a great track. It reminds me a bit of my go-karting days as well. So definitely always a lot of fun. I really think that we can solve this without influencing any other part of the car. Today, it's more like what kerb riding, because I felt that was non-existent in the race. We know that this is a weakness and I also know that we are flat out working on it to try and fix it, because I really feel like it's quite a big performance limitation for us at the moment. Then, of course, naturally, I'm also looking forward to some tracks maybe where we don't really need to take too many kerbs or too many bumps. You can see already, every weekend so far, it's been... Some teams are a bit stronger at particular tracks, and I guess that in a way, of course, makes it also very exciting. It's definitely more challenging. And I think also with, of course, how the race was today, it was very exciting in general. And it definitely keeps us on our toes. We cannot afford to make mistakes or tiny mistakes anymore. So, yeah, every little detail matters now. He was almost dead. Yeah, I started to get to the last chicane and I thought it was debris initially. So I started to close in and then I'm like, ‘Oh my God, it's an animal!’ So yeah, I swerved right at the last moment. I don't know what happened after. Did any of you touch him or you ran off? He ran off? Yeah, good. Luckily, I mean, if that hits your car… Yeah, I really had to slow down for it because I was a bit off the dry line. Yeah, last year, of course, a bird flew into my car. So I didn't want to have a groundhog stuck in my car as well. I call it a beaver, but it's a groundhog. I didn't know what it was exactly. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think we are all very focused. We are still doing a lot of things right, but for whatever reason, we are not in that same flow as we had last year, where everything just seemed to be going really well for us at most places, no reliability issues. And I don't know, for whatever reason, it's all a bit more difficult this year. Some things are a bit hard to explain as well. Sometimes it almost feels like you're a bit in a spiral and it maybe takes a bit of time to get out of it. But yeah, we are for sure on top of everything. Of course, there are always things that you can do better. But yeah, we'll come out of this week and analyse everything again and try to improve. When the Safety Car came? Well, it was good that we boxed because that Inter was almost slick. If you then stay out and it starts raining, you have no grip. I think I already mentioned it on the radio as well. I said, guys, if rain is coming, we have to box. Luckily, we did that because as soon as we restarted, it started to rain and you could see immediately the track was again quite wet. Then, of course, you definitely want new tyres. Yeah, I mean, of course, I think the damage was done yesterday, of course, for Checo. You know, starting in the back, it's very hard in these conditions. Then, of course, I saw him retire with the damage. So I knew that I had to score big, of course, to not let the other teams catch up a lot. But I do think at the end of the day, as long as you keep winning, so you score 25 points, even if the others finish P2, P3, you don't really lose out too much. And then, you know, you kind of can afford sometimes these one-offs. But of course, naturally, we always want the two cars to be up there. And I also have no doubt that that will change very soon again. So, yeah, we just need to work on our car, to be honest, to make it a bit easier to drive also, probably, to feel a bit more comfortable. And then I'm sure that we have both cars back up there like we had in the beginning of the season.",Canada,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"It was. Yeah, it was chaos. It was eventful. To be honest, I felt like I drove a good race, the whole time, from start to finish. The first two stints were very strong. I had an amazing pace. But then the Safety Car had me over. Just like it helped me in Miami, it's now had me back over. So honestly, I thought it was a pretty perfect race from my side. just a bit unlucky but that's what it is. But it was good fun. These conditions, so stressful inside the car but very enjoyable at the same time. Yeah, I mean, the first stint I was in the lead by what 10 or 12 seconds, pulling away, probably two three seconds a lap, so things were going beautifully but of course it's Montréal, so there's always something that's got to come into play. But it was good. Fair play to Max. He drove a good race, no mistakes. But it's good fun. I'm happy with the second, good points for the team. So a good weekend for us. Yeah, I mean, that's what it is. It helped me out in Miami. So I'm not going to be the one to complain. It happens. That's racing sometimes. But I drove a good race. The car's been great all weekend. So thanks to the team. And we're close. It's nice to be so close once again and on the podium. So we'll keep fighting. Yes. We should have won the race today and we didn't, so frustrating. We had the pace. Probably not in the dry at the end. It turned out it didn't really matter too much. But yeah, we should have won today. Simple as that. We didn't do a good job, I think, a good enough job as a team to box when we should have done and not get stuck behind the Safety Car. So I don't think it was a luck or unlucky kind of thing. I don't think it was the same as Miami. This was just making a wrong call. So, it's on me and it's on the team and it's something we'll discuss after. We should have won today. I think we're at a level now where we're not satisfied with a second, like the target is to win. And we didn't do that. So, frustrating, but a tough race and still to end up in second when it could always finish and could be worse is still a good result. No, staying out on the Intermediate helped me. It helped me have a chance against George, so I overcut him. I didn't do a good enough job afterwards, and he was clearly way quicker than us in the dry and even on the Hard tyres. So, no, that was completely the right call and a good decision from us to stay out. It gave me a lot of lap time, but... And it's not the timing of the first Safety Car. I had enough time to box and we didn't box. So this was a mistake on us as a team. And yeah, just something we didn't do a good enough job with. I am. I look forward to every track now because every place we seem to be performing well. Yeah, I mean, it's good to see where Mercedes are going to be, because they've clearly improved a lot. Like the last two weekends, they've been pretty close to probably being the quickest car. This weekend, they've been the quickest all weekend. So I think it was a positive. we finished ahead of them, because they've been the quicker team. So to always beat a quicker car and a quicker team is a nice thing. It's a rewarding thing. But if they're quicker in the next few races, too, and they've kind of joined the fight of Ferrari, Red Bull, and us, then it's only going to make our life, I think, more exciting. More tricky and more stressful because now there will probably be eight cars which are fighting up there and challenging us all together. So exciting for us, exciting for probably everyone watching. And yeah, another opportunity where we can try and make up for today. No, I mean, it takes a lap, two laps to warm up the tyres. So yes, I overcut him and I overcut George, but you need a lap or two to warm up the tyres. So you're always going to have an overcut type of race in that situation because a cold slick is not going to be as good as, you know, the Inter at the end of the stint. So that didn't gain me or lose me anything, the little slide. And it was completely wet on the slick tyre. So it didn't lose me or gain me anything. But we were too far behind Max in the first place. I probably pushed too late on that Inter tyre in the middle stint. It's why we stayed out because I was so quick at the end of that stint, but I probably just didn't push early enough. I probably could have got past George basically one or two laps before the pit stops and closed the gap to Max to give myself a better opportunity of undercutting or overcutting him. And we didn't do that. So that's more of a hindsight thing and something I wouldn't change. I think we made the right call there, but that was all. Yeah, same thing. But we just didn't do it. You wear the Intermediates out pretty quickly, so it was clear that as soon as it was... We were going to have to box for Inters anyway, disregarding the Safety Car. We wouldn't have been able to stay out on the tyres that we were on. So I think Charles went onto the slick, and it was shockingly bad. Yeah, that was, I think, a normal decision. And the one at the end was not to do with Safety Car. That was just boxing onto the slick tyre. And I don't think there was necessarily a correct one. I think within one, two, three laps, probably was all fairly similar in terms of boxing onto the slick. So, yeah, made it good to try and do something different to the others. To be honest, at the minute, I think between Ferrari and us, Yeah, so we'll keep pushing and I think that's one of our biggest strengths at the minute. We have two drivers as McLaren who are up there not making mistakes and getting pretty much everything out of the car every single weekend. Yeah, it's rare that there's not many other teams on the grid that have such a thing. So for us, it's more out of what we can do against Ferrari. Again, we've been a more consistent team coming into this weekend. They've had some mistakes and just struggled a little bit more for whatever reason. But in the end of the day, I think two is going to be better than one, you know, in Max's case. So we're doing a good job, but we still need to keep pushing on and try and bring more upgrades and things like that. Because with Mercedes joining, it's only going to make it harder to score big points like we did today.",Canada,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, it felt like a missed opportunity, to be honest. We were really quick at the beginning of the race on the Inters, and then obviously Lando came through really fast, and then we jumped back onto the slicks, made a couple of mistakes out there, just pushing the limits and paid the price for it. But nevertheless, first podium of the year, we truly had a really fast car this weekend, and to be back in the mix fighting for victory was really fun. That's what Formula 1 is about, and that's why we go racing. I think so. I mean, we had the pace. Max was very strong at that point of the race. But then when we put the Mediums on at the end, we were really, really fast. I think that mistake with Oscar when I tried overtaking him and I lost the position to Lewis cost us at least P2 and maybe going to fight with Max later in the race. But, you know, we'll take all the positives from this weekend. First podium, first pole position of the year and excited moving forward. Yeah, it was pretty tight out there with Oscar and then obviously Lewis at the end as well. So I think it was hard, fair racing. So difficult when there's only one dry line. So you've got to be committed and trust your rivals. Yeah, absolutely, 100%. I think if you told us ahead of this weekend, pole position and P3, we may not have believed you, to be honest. But as Max said, it was such a tricky race out there for everybody. You put a millimetre wide and you're off. I think for me, it was just one too many mistakes at key moments that cost us a shot of fighting with these two towards the end of the race. Yeah, I wasn't… I was pushing to pit because I thought the new Medium would have been really competitive at the end. I need to look at it because to be honest, in hindsight, I think we had really great pace. Were you two on the medium? Yeah, those guys were on the Medium and me being on the Hard, I think we'd have probably been in a really strong position to fight, but, There's a lot of changes you have made if you know how things plan out retrospectively, but I'm happy with the progress we've made. Really proud of the team because we've been pushing these upgrades through and it's really paying dividends. You know, I think Red Bull have had, you know… It's no secret they've struggled a bit with their car these last three races. So I think we need to see how their performance turns out in Barcelona, which is a little bit more of a conventional circuit. But this pace increase that we've seen from us this weekend, it hasn't been a surprise to us because all the numbers back at the factory told us we're going to be finding a big chunk of performance with these upgrades. So Barcelona is going to be interesting for everybody, but I'm confident we can be in the fight. I saw him. Yeah, he ran off. I was quite happy because I caught you up by a couple of tenths! If you hit a beaver, you'll have problems. I think Red Bull have struggled a little bit the last couple of races, yet they've still won two of the last three. So I expect them to probably take a small step when we go back to the European races on more conventional circuits. But I really think our performance step is true and it's real. And I think we can be in this fight with McLaren. Let's hope we can continue being in the fight with Max. And let's see with Ferrari, they obviously had a bit of an off weekend. But no, definitely those last three laps, I was so focused to get back on the podium because I felt like I let the team down a bit, just losing sight of Max and a few mistakes that put me in that position in the first place. And always with Lewis, it's really hard and fair. When you're racing with one of the greats, you know that you can trust them. And that was really great to see at the end. Yeah, it's been the same the last three years that the track dries everywhere except the first two corners, which has been a bit strange considering it was resurfaced this year and that was sort of the limit coming out the pits. It was so, so wet. Turn 1 and 2 were so wet, but to be honest, the rest of the track was really dry. So yeah, whether drainage needs to be changed there or something, I don't know. But Turn 1 and 2 was really the limiting factor.",Canada,post-race,Mercedes
George Russell,"Oh, amazing. It feels so good, feels so good! So much hard work back at the factory has gone into this. We said it in Monaco that we hope this is the start of something for our season, and I think it is. I've missed this feeling. It's awesome here. Every time we come to Montréal, it's such good energy from all the fans. And I'm excited for tomorrow. So, obviously, first step done. But obviously, now we've got our eyes on that win. Why not? Of course. Let's go for it. I think the car has been feeling amazing. Since we bought some upgrades to Monaco, we've sort of really been in that fight now. So, we're going for it tomorrow. Yeah, such a buzz. It's been a while since we've experienced this feeling. And, you know, so much hard work going on behind the scenes at Brackley, at Brixworth. And, you know, it's been a little while to be able to sort of get back in the fight. And we've almost felt like all of that hard work hasn't been paying off. But I think these last two race weekends has really shown that. And as I said, we've been so fast all weekend. Q3 was probably our worst session of the three. And, you know, it bodes well for tomorrow. To be honest, this weekend's been really challenging to know because of the conditions yesterday. You know you've had rain around all weekend and then this morning Lewis was absolutely flying and you know he was well ahead of me and I had to look a lot into his data to try and understand what he was doing differently. And to be honest, that helped me a huge amount. So ahead of this qualifying I’m just so glad that we could pull it off because it, you know, I feel like we really deserve it for all of this hard work we've been putting in and the cars been feeling awesome this weekend. Well, it always feels better when your name's towards the top of the timesheets, to be honest. But it's just turning really nicely through the corners. I think we struggled a lot with understeer before. Last year, we had a lot of oversteer and we've sort of been just trying to find the halfway house between what we had last year and what we had this year. And it feels like we're sort of dialing in that sweet spot right now. So it feels like something we've been saying for a long time, in all honesty. But you know, just really a sense of relief to actually see it translate into a pole position. Yeah, huge. Yeah, it was really challenging, to be honest. All weekend, every single session and every lap it's been changing. The sun comes out, the track temperature warms up, then the clouds come in, it's spitting. And it's just really, really difficult to find that sweet spot. And my lap on the used tyre was really, really strong in Q3. And I was expecting to find about three or four tenths for the second lap on the new tyre. And it just didn't click. But it was fortunate enough that the first lap was good enough for pole. I think it's going to be a tough race for everybody, to be honest. Graining seems to be an issue. And this new track surface, nobody really knows how it's going to pan out. But we've got to go for victory. The car is genuinely really, really fast at the moment. But it's going to be a long race, I think. As soon as you fall off that cliff of the tyres tomorrow, it's going to be really difficult to recover. So, yeah, it could be a bit of a strategic game. Maybe not as extreme as we saw in Monaco last week, but maybe something similar. Yeah, the conditions were changing. I think we were one of the last to do our laps, I don't know when Max did his lap, but my lap in Q2 was really, really strong. My first lap in Q3 was really good, only, I think, two tenths off what I did in Q2, on the old tyre. So I was expecting to do, you know, probably three or four tenths ahead, like it's been all weekend. And the tyres just didn't quite feel right. So, you know, it shows how sensitive everything was. And that was probably the first time that it didn't quite go our way. But as I said, it goes to show how strong our pace has been this weekend. You know, Q1, we didn't need to use two sets of tyres. That was a first. Didn't really need to use two sets in Q2 either. You know, it's sort of come from nowhere, but maybe not a surprise with the upgrades we've been bringing. 100%. I think every lap we've done this weekend, the car's been feeling good. We've always been at the upper end of the timesheets. And, you know, we were talking yesterday, you know, why do we think we were so competitive on FP1, FP2, and, you know, obviously on FP3, really fast as well, so… We need to see in the next races if that continues. But, you know, obviously last week in Monaco, we were a tenth from the front row here, you know, on pole. And this is the first two races we've had with the upgrades. So, yeah, time would tell. We'd only get carried away with ourselves. But, yeah, it's looking good so far. Yeah, 100%. I think going back to what Lando was talking about, when you have a number of years with the same regulations, you sort of hone in on that sweet spot. And we've sort of been zigzagging over these past couple of years and as we've probably entered the last six months, those zigzags have narrowed and we've sort of really been able to fine-tune what it is we want from the car. And I think It just goes to show that small changes can actually bring big improvements in performance. We saw it with McLaren, I think, you know, ourselves have made a big jump as well, especially in terms of the pecking order. So as I said, let's see if this performance is sustainable. But right now I don't see any reason why not. And, you know, we think we've got more to come.",Canada,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"I mean, it's how it is, right? I think overall we still had a good qualifying. The whole weekend has been still a bit tricky for us. But to be P2, I’ll take it. I mean, going into qualifying, I would have definitely taken that. So that it was that close at the end, yeah, makes it really exciting for tomorrow as well. I mean, I felt good in Monaco, but it was just not our track. It was not happening for us. This weekend, again, we didn't have a great build-up to today. But, yeah, I think it will be quite an interesting race with the tyres tomorrow, how they are going to fare, the weather as well. It keeps on coming in and out, the rain. So, yeah, hopefully it will be very exciting. I don't know. We'll think about it. I'm not that stressed about it. Yeah, I mean, in general, I think it wasn't a bad qualifying. I think what was mentioned before, probably Q3, was the weakest of the sessions for Mercedes. So, you know, being on the exact same lap time, yeah, it's great, but in hindsight, I think when you look at their pure pace, I’ll take second. Because after Q2, I saw their lap times, I was like, ‘there is no way that I can do something like that’. Then, of course, there was a little bit of rain in between, like a few spits here and there. But, yeah, I mean... I think overall, just the weekend was again a bit messy from our side, just too many little issues. And then, yeah, from there onwards, we tried to, of course, find the best possible balance with the car. I think we did get a decent balance in qualifying. I was quite happy with it. But, yeah, we need to be able to just have cleaner weekends without issues. And I think that will help a bit as well. Well, we're still struggling with the same things, but of course, the track layout helps compared to Monaco, where Monaco has a lot more low-speed, so it's really important to have good ride, mechanical grip. Here, of course, there's more aero involved. Of course, there are a few places still where you need to ride kerbs or you have bumpy places, but we know those limitations, so we need to just work on that. But that's why I think in general, to be P2 here is alright. Yes, same, like George just mentioned, with the tyres, it's a bit tricky with the graining and maybe some rain in between. So, yes, a lot of question marks and you just need to get going and see what happens. Well, I think in general, when you look at the whole grid, there are quite a few surprises, like good surprises and bad surprises. So, yeah, it just shows that everyone is closing up and it's really details that make the difference. Maybe you understand tyres better. You know, of course, certain weaknesses from your car and probably other teams have their own weaknesses, you know, so you just need to play that as well and take that into account, you know, with certain track layouts. But it's good for Formula 1. I think all of us, we had a lot of time driving in the wet since we grew up, being from the UK and from Holland! I think in general, you are naturally a bit more confident driving in the wet. It's a bit of a different challenge. Of course, nowadays with our cars, it's quite hard to see when it's raining a lot, so we don't always get to race in the full wet conditions. If it's like a little bit of rain tomorrow, even if it comes in and out, it might actually make it really, really interesting. And I think around here, you know, the chicanes, new tarmac can make it very slippery and if you make a tiny mistake, you know, the walls are very close as well. So you have to take that into account. But yeah, hopefully we'll have an exciting race tomorrow.",Canada,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Is that it? It's a shame. I'm super happy. First of all, congrats to Mr. Russell. I knew he's been quick all weekend, so congrats to him and to Mercedes. But I'm happy with third. When you're so close, you always think, ‘could I have jumped in the car for that little bit more?’ But yeah, third is a good job by us, so I'm happy and excited for tomorrow. Pretty much. But that's Montréal. I think that's why we love it here. It's one of the best places to come to every year. So, yeah, I love it. I mean, it's why we're all smiling. We have a good time. It's tricky. Like, a lot of the time, you're thinking you're going to crash, half of it, but when you put a nice lap in and you end up top three, it's always a nice feeling. Yeah, two overtakes tomorrow. Easy, light work. So, no, I'm excited to see what we can do. You know, car's been great all season, especially the last three, four races. We've been on a good roll, but two very fast drivers ahead, plenty of fast drivers behind, so we'll put on a good show tomorrow. I mean, I could be in Max's position and not be on pole, but done a quick enough lap time. So I'm happy. Honestly, I'm happy with third. It's so close. So to be this close with a lap that I didn't think… It was good, but not incredible. And I know George said he didn't get the most out of it, that kind of thing. Just difficult conditions, difficult track layout and challenging, which is kind of what makes Montreal what it is, and definitely probably a bit harder this year than what it's been in the past, but still rewarding to come out with a P3, even if we were only two hundredths off pole. I mean, very, because like George said, again, every lap was different. We've not done many laps in the first place. So it's tyres coming up to temperature, then dropping away, then graining, then the sun coming out, spitting again. It's been difficult just to be consistent and kind of get a nice flow. I don't think it's ever been really that circuit. you can necessarily do that, but yeah difficult to kind of pinpoint exactly what you want from the car because you want two different worlds of good ride, good kerbing and also a car that's kind of just performing at its best from an aero performance-wise. So yeah a challenge in all types, of setting up the car and also from driving. But I think it's what makes it fun around here and challenging and still, as tough as it was to turn out so close and I think from first to seventh or eighth was only two tenths, it's good to watch. I mean, we've had great race pace the last few races. So I'm going to have to say yes. I think we're in the fight. It's so close. But you know, George has been the favourite all weekend. So they've been very quick. Mercedes has been very quick. And George has done a great job coming into qualifying. So you would say on paper they look like they have… They're a bit more comfortable with where they are, you know, from the first run that they've been pretty much at the top of the time sheets and we necessarily haven't. And we've kind of progressed through the weekend a little bit more. But Sunday is always a day we've performed very well, like I said, over the last couple of months. So if we can do the same again tomorrow, then I'm excited to see what race we can put on. I mean, it's not up to me. It doesn't matter what I say. But I think you're not going to have days like today again. You're not going to have days like the last few weeks probably until ‘26, ‘27, ‘28, pretty much like ‘28, ‘29. So it's how it's always been. Every time there's a regulation change, there's big gaps. And even at the end of the last era, so 2020 or whatever it was, ‘21, things were getting closer again. You had still Red Bull against Mercedes, and everyone was getting closer. And then everything spread out again. Red Bull had their time, and now it seems like we've been able to catch up. So just as we're getting there, and I think probably looking ahead to next year already, next year should be an exciting year for everyone, just from first to last. I think it's going to be exciting. But then that's all going to go in ‘26. So it depends what you want. I think it's still exciting now. I know it's an exciting qualifying. There might be some benefits in the race for those regulations. There might be some things that are worse. The type of racing you're going to get is probably quite different. So it's complicated. It's not a simple answer. I don't know the answer at the same time. I don't think anyone knows exactly how it's going to pan out. Yeah, always at the end of these regulation changes we see days like today and we see closer battles between, now Mercedes up here as well. So that's four teams who are fighting towards the top. Eight cars, you're going to see different winners. And I think that's exciting for people watching, but definitely you're not going to have that in ‘26. So it depends if you want to kind of keep this excitement and keep this challenge that we have now, or if you want to change everything again and have another few years where it's far apart.",Canada,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lance Stroll,"I Well, it's home. I grew up here, so, you know, 20 minutes away from the track, so it's always special coming back. Oh, back in my young days, yeah, when I was just a little guy, I remember the Schumacher days, early 2000s, coming to watch the race here was always a very exciting weekend. And yeah, I mean, inspired me in many ways to be here today, you know? It's a fun track. It's got, like, some big kerbs and technical aspects of it. Not much margin on exits with the walls being close. So I've always enjoyed the challenge here. And the weather can always be interesting. It can always be a fun factor too, which it looks like it might be this weekend, so we'll see. I hope so. We seem a little more competitive on the tracks with longer straights. And our car is, I think, pretty efficient. So I hope. Yeah, that's where my head's at, for sure. Seems to be a pretty popular question that I've been getting asked recently. And yeah, it's super exciting. Everything that's happening at Silverstone and the project with the team and how we've grown over the last few years. And we continue to grow. So it's definitely in my mind, too, continue being a part of that, but really focused on Montréal this weekend and enjoy my home race and trying to have a good result this weekend. I mean, it's definitely been the tendency… It was the tendency last year. We were always fighting top five, and then again this year, I think we were quick over one lap at the beginning of the year, suffered a little bit more with deg, but we were still kind of top five, top seven range. And now we're kind of scrapping for a point or two on a good weekend, which is not what we want as a team. I think we definitely do understand our issues. I think we understand some of the decisions, directions that we've chosen to follow through with. We know some of the mistakes that we've made. And now it's just a matter of sorting ourselves out and putting some new upgrades on the car going forward that address some of these issues that we know we have. But it's not an overnight fix. Realistic expectations, it's going to be over the course of, I hope, not too many races, but definitely a few races. And yeah, but there's still a lot of racing left. There's still, I don't know how, this is race 10 (sic), so there's still, I think, 13 or 14 races left, if I'm not mistaken. So long season, but we have some work to do. Early days, yes. Back in my karting days, I'd religiously wash my underwear every night and make sure it went in the wash. And if I was really desperate, sometimes it didn't go in the wash! But no, after many years, those things kind of fade. And yeah, I guess it gets a bit dull. And the underwear got a bit small over the years, so I had to give it up!",Canada,thursday,Aston Martin
Sergio Pérez,"I think like every negotiation, you always have a process to go through, which is not always really nice to do it in between the races where everything is flat out. So it's really nice to get this distraction for the team and for myself out of the way so that we can focus on pure performance. And I think that's the best thing for our team. Well, I think, like you say, there are some great teams making a lot of progress and we've got to do the same. I think it's always great to be part of a set of regulations with the team, you know, when you're changing regulations and you're part of that team, you're already working on that, giving some ideas here and there, and it's something really quite nice to have, to be able to be part of that. Well, I think it's... I hope it's not as severe as it was in Monaco with the right issues that we had there. We've done some work, some analysis, and I think it's great to have straightaway sort of a similar challenge to Monaco in many aspects. So it will be an interesting one, but I do expect us to be a little bit stronger. I don't think it will be our strongest track, but I really hope that we can be fighting up there. Well, I think in Formula 1, there are always different agendas, and I really get that. It's something that has been with every driver since we got in the sport. And I think the best thing to do is just to close the visor and focus on my job, do the best for myself, for my career. And at the end of the day, when my career is finished, it's the only thing that will matter to me. What people have to say or not… I mean, I appreciate that everyone has their opinion, but at the end of the day, I'm here to do the best for my career and I'm happy with what I have achieved. Well, I obviously feel happy once you get an agreement. It really means that both parties are happy with what we got, and happy to move forward. And obviously, we’ve got great targets ahead of us. Red Bull is a team that really takes everything out of you. It's something that since I came here, the amount of how intense everything is on track, off track, and it's a challenge you don't have anywhere else. I haven't had that sort of challenge in my career. When I sign, I'm really up for it and willing to give my 100%. It was just a very straightforward negotiation. Obviously, I've been in the team for a few years already, so it's always, I think, when you are already there, it's a lot easier to reach an agreement. I mean, you're always talking to two different teams. There were other options out there, but for me, my plan A, B, and C was definitely to stay at Red Bull. I really want to finish my career here, wherever that is. It's a team that has given me so much into my career that I'm just really happy. And yeah, I just want to give my best to this team until my last lap. Well, I think it's natural, you know. It's the third year of the same regulations. It's natural that teams are coming closer to us. We're finding it harder as well to find performance. But, yeah, I think we know where our biggest chunk of performance is going to come from. I don't think we have unlocked that much during the year compared to other teams. So hopefully once we are able to unlock some of that performance, we can be in better shape, especially at different types of circuits. But yeah, the competition is super, super high. And I think this weekend there are three or four teams that can potentially get the victory. So I think it's great to have this competition. Well, certainly when you look at Fernando or even Lewis, there's a long way to go. But I think I didn't sign my last contract. I don't think I've done that. I don't think it's something that you feel. Because when you commit to two years in Formula 1, it's a lot of time, a lot of energy, and it's a long way down the line. So yeah, to be honest, I don't really think about that. But yeah, what I'm pretty sure about is that I want to finish my career at Red Bull. Yeah, I think we... Otherwise, we’ve got to enjoy the year and a half that we’ve got left with this regulation in this very close racing. Because there's always a potential that someone is going to get it right – very right – like we've seen some other teams have done that in the past. And then it's really difficult. It takes a few years to catch up. So I do expect that to happen in ‘26. As always, I think the best for the sport will be to keep the rules as consistent as possible. But also, like Oscar said, there is a lot to do with the sport, with the technology involved to attract new manufacturers. I don't think it's going to be as extreme as it was in Monaco, but obviously it's a track where you need to ride the kerbs. Riding is definitely one of the biggest talking points in this track, so I do expect to suffer a bit in that regard. But like I say, we've done some work, we've done some understanding as well, so I really hope we are able to make a good step forward in that direction. We always find out when we get on track. Sometimes they've done a lot of resurfacing and the track is pretty much the same. So we'll see if that has changed compared to last year. Some cameras, I would. But no, I just like to keep it simple. I think Formula 1 is already complicated enough to mess around, so just keep it simple.",Canada,thursday,Red Bull
Lewis Hamilton,"I don't know. Hi, everyone. I think it's probably just kind of a street circuit and a bit like a go-kart track, long straights. So it's a track that bodes well for late brakers and someone that's aggressive, I guess, aggressive driving style. I think I've had an aggressive driving style for a long time, yeah. Yes, the car's continuing to improve. I think everyone's obviously taken a step hopefully closer to the Red Bulls, and I think that's been really positive. But incredibly proud of everyone back at the factory, just how hard everyone's working and how resilient everyone is. Everyone's just staying very focused, head down. The morale's really great in the team, so I'm hoping that we can get closer to these guys and start actually competing at the front with these. I don't think it's far away. And so we've got the upgrade. Both cars have the upgrade this weekend. So I'm looking forward to seeing how that feels actually on track. I'll try. The biggest improvement I think coming into this year has been ride quality and being able to get the car lower, which is what others have been able to do. And then stability on entry of corners. The car is far more predictable than it ever was, particularly the last couple of years. And particularly this year, it's a lot more stable, so we can be more committed into the corners. But then through corner balance is where we've been lacking, where some of the others have really taken a big step. So that's what we're trying to work on. Yes. Yeah, he's the boss and really a huge amount of support from John Elkann, who I've got a great relationship with. And so with those two together, Fred and John, we worked really closely. Well, I mean, I haven’t driven a black car for a while, so I probably won't be pushing for that too early on. But no, I mean, we've definitely spoken about impact work and John and the team have a lot of philanthropy work that they do, so we'll be working very closely with Mission 44 and with the impact stuff that they're doing. I think within the sport, we have to continue to do more, but more outside we'll be doing quite a bit together. So that's really exciting. I mean, it's only 30 kilos, so it's going in the right direction, but it's still heavy. So, I've only just seen what you've all seen this morning, so… I don't really have huge thoughts on it just yet. I've spoken to some drivers who have driven it on the simulator – I haven't – but they said it's pretty slow. So we will see whether it's actually the right direction or not. But I think in terms of sustainability, particularly on the power unit side, I think that's a really bold step and I think it's going in the right direction. We've just got to make sure the cars are efficient, fast, and a natural step forward, and actually racing is improved. Probably similar to what Oscar said. I think it's difficult to say, but more often than not, when they've done the changes, some teams do better than the others, and there is a bit of a difference early on. I hope that with this new regulation change that everything's a bit closer, and the engine's not complete revamp. It's not like moving from V8 to V6, so hopefully through that, that doesn't make too big a difference, and then it's just about getting the cars right. No. In general, I don't particularly feel emotional this weekend. But thinking about it, it would be amazing to finish off with a great result with Mercedes, where I had my first win with them here. Well, Mercedes-powered, obviously, back in 2007. And so many great years together here. But to be honest, like every race, we're trying to finish on a high. It hasn't been the case in the first quarter of the season, but I think you've seen, for example, with McLaren switching it around last year and anything's possible. So I do think we're moving in the right direction and I really am hopeful that we're going to be in the mix, particularly for the second half of the season. A transfer window? That's a new one. I haven't thought about it. I think it's really exciting in the other sports, like in the NFL, for example. But I think it's quite exciting now [in F1]. No one knows who's going where. Obviously, bit by bit, you see it through drips throughout the season. And I think when you do have drivers moving around, it does cause this bit of chaos. And I saw Formula 1 post the other day that there are still many seats that are not yet signed up. So like Nico said, it's quite an exciting time. For us, we're lucky and we feel very fortunate that we've got something locked in. And that really enables you to plan for your future and really channel your energy. But it's exciting for us to now see where everyone's moving. Oh, shoot. The only things that really stick out was just I think just basically from that whole first 12 races, but particularly coming here, first time to Montréal, and immediately like from the get-go., I loved the circuit and gelled well with it and that's always been the case when I've come here I think. But I think I was just really living my dream in those first six races, in kind of in disbelief that I'd actually made it and also having the success that we were having, podiums each weekend. And then I think really, ultimately just being on the podium seeing that big trophy that you've seen the greats in the past get to hoist up. And I think ultimately looking down and seeing my dad, just how happy he was. It was kind of a relief because of all the sleepless nights and all the energy and time that the family put into it, you know. We finally made it. And something that we continuously believed through our career together, that we had the ability to do something like that. And we finally realised it then. So it was a very, very special weekend. And yeah, it's one I will never forget. That was awesome. I mean, he's incredible. I mean, I love MotoGP and I really am excited for the future of the sport as well. I think that they'll probably be learning a lot from what has happened with Liberty and Formula 1 over the past years and I think there's a lot of growth that will happen. But the racing is amazing. And then to see Marquez on the Ducati is going to be cool. I mean, the Ducati has always been such a cool bike. But I think from an athlete's perspective or a rider or driver's perspective, I think it's... Maybe similar for some of you, where you've been maybe in a job for a long, long time, it's great to have something new, a new environment, new desk, new people to work with and new challenges. And there's nerves, there are all these things that you are unsure of, in the sense of you don't know how you're going to blend in an environment, for example. But that's exciting. And it's great when you're welcomed into a new space. So, yeah, I think it's really cool. I can't wait to see him there on that bike. I think me neither now, but definitely until I was about 18, 19, I did. So I had a lucky conker. Somehow, I used to put it in my suit, like Sanka would put the lucky egg in Cool Runnings. And I don't know how, but it disappeared in a race. And then lucky underwear as well. My mum shrunk them. And then I think there's a sequence, if you look at tennis players, where they bounce the ball several times, or whether it's getting in the car from one side or putting your right sock on first. You know, like the sequence you would normally go through. And I missed one of the sequences, and I crashed. It was like a race in Germany when I was in Formula 3, and I was like, after that, no more superstitions.
SP: I don't have one, but I really like the one from Fernando to avoid certain people before you jump in the car! Depends on who he's avoiding.",Canada,thursday,Mercedes
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yeah. Somewhat optimistic. First of all, I love this place. I love this track. It's probably one of my favourites, if not the favourite. So looking forward to just get out there. I really hope there is going to be some dry running, too, and not just the full wet. It's more low-speed content, the circuit, which kind of helps and suits our car better. So that makes me a little bit more optimistic to be more competitive. No, just to exploit the track, just to drive in the dry as well, to take the kerbs at the proper speed and everything. It's a different sensation in the dry compared to... Yeah, I mean, there is no guarantee when it's wet or changeable conditions that you're going to do well. But obviously that spices things up, puts everyone more on the edge. I don't mind it, but I’ll take it as it comes. It's good. I mean, yeah, it happened, but, it's done and dusted. No point… There was not much to debrief or dwell on it. Obviously, you know, look forward and focus on the task and the racing ahead now. Yeah, it's certainly quite different. Some interesting areas and aspects. I think some that still need a bit further work. Like Lewis said, I think the weight reduction is good, but then 30 kilos is also… It's not the world. It looks like a lot less downforce, especially high-speed corners. It will be quite a different scenario and characteristic to now. So, you know, there is going to be definitely a drastic change. And, you know, change is always… You're not always so open to it. But, yeah, we'll see what happens between now and, you know, in the one and a half years, if there might be some small adjustments or not with what's going on. It's not much to manage, to be honest. It's all in theory, you know, in six, seven months’ time, when it starts. It's actually quite comfortable for me for the first time in my career, you know, that I that I'm kind of secured and I know where my future is and I watch the musical chairs from a distance. And this is, you know, comfortable and kind of a nice situation to be in. Like I said, usually I've been on the other side, so it's good from that point of view. But for the moment I'm fully focused on the season with Haas and everything and next year, like I said, it's all in theory and still quite far away, so it's not weird or awkward or anything.",Canada,thursday,Haas
Pierre Gasly,"Well, I must say it was pretty positive. First Q3 of the year, we managed to show some good speed throughout the whole qualifying, Q1, Q2, Q3. So definitely some good signs. Obviously, we know Monaco is kind of a particular track, so we know we might not be in similar positions on all the tracks, but definitely some good signs. Yeah, it's still... We know we're still a bit on the back foot, and we're trying to rethink a bit how we want to approach this car concept. So at the minute, it's mainly focusing on maximising what we got. And as we can see, a lot can happen on race day. So yeah, we'll see. We'll try again our best. We know we're fighting for a point right at the back of the top 10. But hopefully, we can be in a position to repeat the performance of Monaco. To be honest, absolutely nothing. I think, you know, at the minute it's quite clear the position I'm in. And yeah, for my future at the moment, I have nothing really to announce. And then, yeah, you guys will know in due time. Yeah, it's been... I'm just taking time to think, because I know how you guys are going to take every single word that comes out. It's a long story between Esteban and myself. And I think so far in the last year and a half, we managed to work and co-operate very professionally. So I think this is important to mention. It hasn't always been easy, as you would imagine from two very competitive drivers. But yeah, considering the story between us, I think it's been It's been good. So, yeah, I will say I'll stick to these lines. Can you repeat the question, please? Well, I think the directives were pretty clear in Monaco. Unfortunately, it's not what happened on track. But yeah, I'm pretty confident that moving forward, we won't face any issues. I don't have a deadline. particularly, and I think the market at the moment is quite open and everybody is aware of what opportunities are out there. So, no, at the moment, I don't want to give too much details on that. I think everything is going well and are in discussions. And that's about it. I think it's pretty exciting times at the moment with how things are. And since the start of the year, I think you guys wrote a lot about it and kept everyone very busy. I think it's fun. We don't need to copy everything that others are doing. And it's always been the case in Formula 1. And I think it works well that way. Not that many. I think just some routine you know. Like just routine stuff. Your warm-up and yeah if anything, I just pray before getting in the car and that's for me the most important one.",Canada,thursday,Alpine
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I think, like you said, the last three weekends have been very solid, I think, for the whole team, but also for me personally. Monaco was really the first time that we got a really strong result out of it. But yeah, I mean, clearly the car is performing well at the moment and I feel like I've taken a step forward as well and been able to build some consistency in the last few weekends, which is always nice. But yeah, I feel like I'm in a good place. I would say more just a confidence thing. I think there have been good moments here and there, even at the start of the season. I think the first few rounds were quite promising, a couple of difficult races in the middle, but on the whole, I feel like I've taken a good step forward in quite a few areas from last year. I think it's just been the consistency that's really been the missing thing. So the last few weekends have been good to try and get on top of that. But I don't think I've done anything special. I don't think as a team we've really done anything special. We've just got the car in a good window. And with the upgrades, clearly it's performing well. So yeah, I think we're all just taking it up a notch. I hope so. I think we can be pretty confident that we'll be somewhere in the mix, which is pretty exciting to say. I don't know if we'll be the favourites, so to speak, but I don't really know who you can say are the favourites at the moment. So, yeah, excited to see where we come out. Hopefully it's better than finishing 11th. But, yeah, I think we're definitely in the mix now, and I think the last few weekends have proven that on very different tracks. In some ways, yes. In some ways, no. I mean, it's always more exciting when you're fighting at the front, obviously. That's what we're all here for. I'm very fortunate that I have the opportunity to be able to be in that position. But, you know, we're all here because we've been successful leading into F1 and we all want to win. So, yeah, it is very exciting having that opportunity. I think last year... There were points where we could get a podium, but a win was never realistic, I would say. Whereas this year, a win is certainly on the cards. And I would say the last few weekends, with a few things going slightly differently, then there's been a lot of potential. It does bring me back a bit to my junior days. And it does change the feeling of how you go racing a little bit. It doesn't change the approach, I would say. But of course, when you go into a weekend knowing that you can fight for a win, it's a bit nicer than knowing that you should be trying to fight for a point, maybe. That was us 12 months ago. So, you know, I guess I know already what it's like to be in both positions, but I think we all know which position we'd rather choose. And I'll stop there. I mean, I kind of agree with both points. I think every time the regs have changed, it's led to a pretty big spread, especially with engines, 2014 being the last time with that and kicking off a really long period of dominance. And I think we've seen even with these regs, we're only just starting to catch up to Red Bull, week in, week out, now. I think we have an important place in society to be at the forefront of technology and innovation, and I think that's always what F1's been about in some ways. And I guess you could argue that sometimes that does come at the cost of the racing, which is always a shame. Yeah, I think both points are kind of separate, really. I wouldn't be surprised if the teams sort of separate a bit more in 2026, both with different aero regs and especially the engine regs. There's a very big chance, I would say, that the teams are going to be more spread out than what they are now. But we'll have to wait and see. I don't have any. Sorry, that's a boring answer! I don't have any superstitions. I think probably all of us have like a certain routine before we get in the car. I like to jump in the car from the left, but purely because I find it more comfortable than jumping in from the right. So, um, if I have to jump in from the other side of the car, then I will.",Canada,thursday,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"No words can explain that. It's such a difficult race. I think the fact that twice I've been starting in pole position and couldn’t quite make it, makes it even better in a way. It means a lot, obviously. It's the race that made me dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver one day. So yeah, it was a difficult race emotionally because already 15 laps to the end, you're just hoping that nothing happens. Already the emotions were coming. I have to say that I was thinking to my dad a lot more. It was a dream of ours for me to race here and to win, so it's unbelievable. It's really difficult. At first, I thought we were... I mean, we had quite a lot of margin, but we knew there were 78 laps to do on the same tyres, which was very, very difficult. But yeah, we did a great management of the tyres. There was a big part of the race where we had to manage the gap with George. And then in the last 10 laps, I could push a bit more, and the car felt amazing. So I just want to thank the team for having done such incredible work over the last few months. giving me the opportunity to finally win this race is, again, a very special feeling. Just a huge thank you. The parade laps already were special, on the bus, and seeing so many of my friends on the balcony, so many people I know on the balcony, and it was just very, very special, so... Yeah, this one means a lot. And the support that I've had over the weekend means a huge amount. So thank you. Thank you so much to everybody. I think so. Obviously Monza in 2019 was extremely special. But Monaco is the Grand Prix that made me dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver. Yeah, I remember being so young and watching the race with my friends, obviously with my father, that has done absolutely everything for me to get to where I am today, and I feel like I don't only accomplish a dream of mine today, but also one of his. And yeah, it's just such a special weekend overall. It's a street track, it's such a difficult track to put everything together from FP1 to qualifying to then all the laps that you have to do in the race. And to finally make it in front of my whole family, my friends that were watching all over the track is a very, very, very special feeling. I think where I struggled most to actually contain my emotions was during the last 10 laps of the race. More than on the podium. I realised actually two laps to the end that I was struggling to see out of the tunnel just because I had tears in my eyes. And I was like, ***** Charles, you cannot do that now. You still have two laps to finish’. And especially on a track like Monaco, you have to be on it all the way to the end. It was very difficult to contain those emotions, those thoughts again, of the people that have helped me to get to where I am today. It's only a win. The season is still very, very long. It's 25 points like any other wins. However, emotionally, this one means so much. And I think the fact as well that we started twice on pole position in the past and that we couldn't manage to get the win for one reason or another, that we couldn't really control, not in our control, makes this one even more so special. I feel that the turning point of the season has been a few races ago already. We didn't have quite the car to win a race in the last few races. However, we did here, and I knew that the opportunity had to be taken, and I did. So on that, we did a really good job. I've had two qualifyings where I struggled at the beginning of the season, but from then on, I worked on my qualifying pace, and since then, I'm extremely happy with the job we are doing. So, yeah, really happy with how it goes, and I hope that this will bring us to many more wins. We shouldn't get carried away, that obviously Monaco is such a specific track, and I think we had a really good car this weekend. It doesn't mean that it will stay like that until the end of the year, but looking back at the first few races of the season, I think we did a great job maximising all the races that we have done, and yeah, we'll keep it going. Oh, is it 31? Oh, somebody told me 23, so I was excited. But 31 is OK. I mean, I'll take it anyway, but it's a bit more than what I had been told. So, yeah, it's OK. But I don't think about the championship for now anyway, and it's still too early on in the season. I think the upgrades that we have brought in Imola, we have still to see how well they work and where it will bring us. And then it's all about maximising all weekends, and then hopefully, little by little, we'll get there. Yeah, I've already said to Fred to get ready because he will definitely jump with me in the harbour. On my notebook, I write lots of technical stuff. However, definitely not for the party, but it's very clear in my mind what I've got to do tonight with all the mechanics and engineers. And I cannot wait to just enjoy the moment. It's such a special moment in my career that you've got to celebrate and then already from maybe not tomorrow but after tomorrow we'll start thinking about Canada and focus 100% again to maximise the next weekend. Yes, I did see that. Like, it was optimistic! But I was managing like crazy. I don't know, we were probably three seconds off the pace, three-and-a-half seconds off the pace. So I knew that I just had to push a little bit more. The thing that I didn't know is how much Oscar was willing to push at this moment of the race, knowing that there were still 70 laps to go. So as soon as I saw that, I was like, ‘OK, maybe I'm not going to take it that easy in the slow part’ just to not be under too much pressure there. But after that, I felt like we had everything under control. The pace of the car was amazing. The tyres felt really, really good. Even in the last laps, I felt like I could do another race. There was a lot of tyre management, obviously, at the beginning. So everything felt really, really good. As I said, I think it's more the thoughts in the last 15 laps that were very difficult to manage and a lot more than in the past in my career. But no negative thoughts. It was more, again, about the... Yeah, everything that has happened until now, but good moments in karting and dreaming of getting there and most of these moments, but none of the bad moments of the last few years. I never believed in the curse. However, it always felt very difficult in the two occasions I had to win here. One, I couldn't even start the race. The second one, we didn't make the right choice, I think. So it was very, very frustrating to lose those wins. The thing is that as a driver you never really know when will be the next opportunity to win and especially when it's your home race and even more so when your home race is Monaco, that is such a special track, such a difficult track and such a difficult weekend to master and to do everything perfectly which we did. So I knew that today was another opportunity. I knew how it felt the last two times I was in this position, But I obviously really wanted to get that victory today, so there's a bit of tension. But as I've said., as soon as I put the helmet on and as soon as I get into the car I don't feel anything anymore. And then it's all about trying to maximise the car that you have thinking about the tyres and thinking about all the stuff that I had to think of to manage this race the best way possible. So it's more the moments before the race and before putting the helmet on. I mean, Ayrton has always been my idol and he was incredibly special in Monaco. And I think that probably the first time my father spoke to me about Ayrton, he told me to go and look this onboard of him driving around the streets of Monaco and I was like ‘oh my God, that's crazy!’ And from that day onwards then obviously I knew more and more growing up, more and more about Ayrton and that added to the fact that he was just becoming more and more my idol. But the fact he was so special in Monaco was incredible to see. To win in Monaco now myself as well, is amazing. I did. I actually slept really well. I ate like crazy yesterday night. I actually got too late at home and I couldn't cook, so I ordered my favourite pizza, which is not the best preparation to race normally, but I was like, ‘OK, maybe mentally it will help me to take the pressure off a little bit’. And yeah, that's it. I slept really well. Pizza Margherita with prosciutto crudo. Never pineapple. Yeah, I think we had a target gap with Russell that we didn't want to open too much and I wasn't too much for that because I felt like I was a lot off the pace and what I didn't want is that Oscar started to push straight away and then you don't have references. I was going so slow in the middle of the race that if you start to push, then you don't really know where to brake and that's where mistakes can happen. So I just wanted to get into the rhythm and start to push a bit more. But obviously, the team was telling me, slow down, slow down, slow down. So I was slowing down, but it wasn't the nicest moment of the race. Then in the last 15 laps, I could push a bit more and feel a bit more the car. And there, I enjoyed it a lot more. But yeah, I knew I had to do those things to get the win or at least to secure every possible scenario. And as much as I don't believe in luck, I wanted to make sure that I was covering all possible scenarios. I have no doubts. I think since the first day he joined and that he's got everything to bring back the team to where it belongs and that means to a world championship. He's got such a clear vision of what he wants to achieve and how to achieve it. He doesn't lose time and that is definitely his strength and I think his vision is really good. We share it very often, on how he wants to achieve those targets. I've always been completely aligned with the way he wants to change things to get to where we want to get. I have no doubt that he's the right person and that he's helping the team to get there. It was very much in my mind. As I said, I think in every race I have done, there's been not one race where I was thinking about this kind of personal stuff inside the car, because you've got to stay on it. Maybe Baku in 2017. Obviously, everything was still very fresh for me, so it was difficult to manage mentally. However, it's probably the first time in my career that it happened again while driving, where you've got these flashbacks of all these moments that we have spent together, all the sacrifices that he has done for me to get to where I am. And as I said earlier, it's not only my dream, but it was both of our dreams to get there. And obviously, my whole family was supporting and was obviously dreaming of that moment, which makes it even more special. But yeah, that was, again, as I said earlier, probably the moment that was the most difficult to manage today. Yes, The Prince was very emotional. We know each other since a very long time. And actually, I remember when I was 12 or 13 years old, we got to the palace for the first time with my father to try and have some support with my career that was just starting to be a bit more serious. And since then he has always kept an eye on my career, has always supported me, has always had nice words in very good moments, but also in moments that were much more difficult, and I think the fact that he has seen me growing up and all the support that he has given me over the years made it quite emotional for me and also for him. No, no, not at all. And I think the perception from the outside sometimes can change but at the end what I try to do and what I do is to try and keep the things as stable as possible and whenever I go in a weekend you just try and do exactly the same thing as what you've done In the previous weekend, learning from mistakes, obviously always striving to improve and get better, but it's always fine-tuning and very little changes in the approach that you have, and I think it's not specific to Monaco compared to others. I mean, there's a different approach in free practice, but just because it's a street track. But, yeah, I don't feel like I've done anything very differently compared to the past.",Monaco,post-race,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, tricky race. You know, the pace at the beginning was incredibly slow and I had one little half look before the tunnel, but yeah, I didn't have... Well, I didn't have a small enough car to fit into a gap. So yeah, thanks to the whole team. It's been a great weekend all round. And yeah, nice to finally put a result on the board. We've been very strong for the last few weekends, but didn't really have the results to show for it. So nice to have a podium, and what better place? Yeah, I mean, it does. But to be honest, Charles has been mega all weekend. And, you know, they've been quick from the very first lap. And I think it would have taken something pretty special in quali to outdo him. The opportunity was almost there, but it would have taken probably the best lap of my life. So I'm happy with P2. A good result for the team again and yeah, very, very happy. Thank you. Cheers. Tell you what, I think I slept longer than I did last night, waiting for Charles just now. No, I'm very, very happy. Yeah, third podium in F1 certainly doesn't get old. So, no, very happy to have it here in Monaco, especially, you know, if there's one podium apart from your home podium that you want to stand on, it's probably here. So, very, very pleased for the whole team. I think especially for our side of the garage, it's been a promising few weekends now and nice to finally get a good result out of it. So very, very happy. I had an attempt about 10 or 15 laps in, into Turn 8. We were going pretty slow. I think at one point we were going slower than Formula 2. You know, when you're going that slow, you've got a fair few options. But I kind of knew that once I showed my hand in where I was going to try and overtake, that he would probably be wise to it from there. So I managed to get very close in Turn 7, one lap. I tried to show the nose in Turn 8 but he reacted just quick enough, so after that point I knew I was going to be very limited on options. Yeah, I mean, it was OK. I think for the first half of the race, it was impossible to tell what the penalty of that was. I think towards the end, probably a combination of trying to keep the pace of the race reasonably quick, plus the floor, yeah, just struggled a little bit towards the end, but overall pretty happy with it. And yeah, the last 10 laps or so, I was pretty happy we were in Monaco. I think so. I think it's been three very different circuits in the past three races, and we've been competitive at all of them. Miami was probably one of our worst circuits before this year. Imola has always been kind to us, but we had a very strong weekend there, and here's been… Let's say our car's never been the strongest in the slow corners, and this weekend we've been very quick again. So I think we can be confident wherever we go. I feel like we don't have to rely on the high-speed circuits like we did last year to get our results, which is a very exciting thing to have going forward. And, yeah, I think the pecking order is as tight as it's ever been, especially this weekend. Going into qualifying, I think we thought that there could be any one of four teams on pole, which I don't think we've been able to say for a while. So, I think we can definitely be in the fight every weekend. I definitely felt the touch at Turn 1 and at that part of the car, it's such a sensitive part. The team told me how much downforce I was losing before we tried to fix it and it was a pretty big number. I don't know what we managed to get it down to but yeah, obviously the length of the red flag helped us out quite a lot there. And being in Monaco, it's probably the one track where having damage doesn't hurt you as much. So, yeah, it was a very, very small touch. But with these cars, especially with the floor being so sensitive to the downforce it generates, it can ruin your race very easily. So, yeah, I was very happy we could try and fix it.",Monaco,post-race,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it was a tight one and obviously a very bad feeling there in lap one that very quickly turned into a very good feeling after getting reinstated at P3. From there on, really, the race pace was good, as we expected. It's just impossible to get past through the streets of Monaco. But I'm extremely happy to see Charles win his home Grand Prix. The way he's been driving all weekend and managed to share this podium with him in P3. It's a great feeling for the whole team. I think they all deserve it. And yeah, it looks like we're getting stronger and stronger every weekend. Yeah, once I was sure that Lando behind didn’t have a gap to pit for Medium and attack me at the end, I focused on doing some fast laps. I went down to the 1m14s, which was really quick at the time, and I said, OK, maybe I have a chance at putting a bit of pressure on Oscar, and maybe I can get him to do a mistake, because obviously I knew that passing him was impossible. And, yeah, we got him under pressure. I saw him lose the rear a couple of times and getting a bit loose, but it was not enough to pass. I think it means more for the fact that being a Ferrari driver, being P3, but especially seeing your team-mate that is Monegasque standing on top of the podium in front of his home crowd, in front of all the tifosi and all the mechanics, I think it's one of the best images I've seen in Formula 1 and extremely happy for him, for the team. He deserves it because he's driven at an incredible level this weekend and he's put together a really solid weekend. And yeah, it was coming for him, I felt, because he was driving really well recently. Yeah, it's a really good day for Ferrari and Charles. Yeah, I got a really good start and I had kind of an opportunity going into Turn 1 and I arrived a bit long, with a lot of understeer in the car and trying to keep the position with Oscar, as it's pretty much your only chance to pass. Then I understeered off a bit into him on the exit and yeah, we had the slightest of contacts. For some reason, Oscar and I, we seem to have a magnet recently between each other, for some reason that I don't understand, because we get on well and everything is okay, but we seem to always find each other on track. Yeah, I didn't even feel the contact. It was so slight or it was so small that I didn't even see it or feel it. But as soon as I exit Turn 1, I could feel the puncture. And yeah, it looked like my race was over there at one point. And then I was really lucky to get the P3 back and race from there the rest of the race. No, even when you see the tyre, it was such a slight cut that the tyre got from the contact that there was no issues with the car, no damage. It was just the smallest of contacts. A bit unlucky to get the puncture in a way, but then lucky to get the position back. From there on, honestly, it was a new race and we had our opportunities, but never really a clear one. I got tempted a few times, but after lap one and obviously knowing that Monaco is a bit of all-or-nothing, you know that when you go for a move, the most likely outcome is contact between the two cars and a potential DNF for the two cars. And I felt like that was too much to lose for both Oscar and myself, you know, and my team. So unfortunately, Monaco is like that. I did have my opportunities and my temptations, both in the first 15 laps and in the last 10 laps, but never really a clear chance to see how we could get out of the corner untouched. So, yeah, as I knew from Friday, my race pace was going to be good. I was the fastest on Friday practice in terms of race pace. Again, today, when I could show the pace, it was really, really good. But Monaco is track position and we lost it to Oscar yesterday. I think my common sense tells me that on normal tracks Red Bull should still be favourites. Domination, like we were seeing, hopefully not. But favourites, yes. And then it will be a very tight fight with both McLaren and us. I think we are all three at a very similar level. Our last reference of a normal track is Imola and Miami. And if I see those two tracks, we seem to be half a tenth behind McLaren and maybe a tenth or two behind Red Bull. And yeah, it still means that that any small progress, any small upgrade, any small thing that we bring to the car might switch it to a potential race victory or a winning car. Monaco, we've always been strong. Street circuits like Singapore and last year in Monaco, it shows the strengths of the Ferrari. And at the same time, being within 24 points of the Red Bull in the Constructors, you see that when you put them under pressure yesterday, Max did a mistake in Q3 run two, Checo was out in Q1. We all just need to be there, you know, to show that these things can happen to Red Bull too. And yesterday is the best example. From my side, I've seen the same Charles that I've seen any other year in Monaco. Obviously, it's your home race, so you obviously can tell he's a very busy man when he's in Monaco. But nothing different. He's a guy that he's always been super quick around Monaco. He has performed exceptionally well. The only thing I saw different is that he seemed to be in Q3 run two already in FP1, Q3 run two mode. And yeah, I had my moments trying to get to that level of pushing and then I lost confidence. And then while we are normally within half a tenth of each other, this week in those two, three moments in FP1 and FP2 it just put me a step behind in confidence and I couldn't quite get close enough in quali. I think we will have… I think Ferrari we will have our opportunities in these sort of tracks. I think McLaren will have their opportunities, but when I talk about a normal track we can talk about maybe a Barcelona. Canada, I think is quite specific but a Barcelona or any European truck, where I consider it to be a normal track, I still think Red Bull will be favourites, but I don't think they'll dominate like they used to do. And I think that's good news for the championship. And it's just worth being within a tenth or two in quali, that even if they're favourites, they cannot afford to do any mistakes. And that's where both Ferrari and McLaren, we can capitalise, which is a position that in Bahrain Race 1, no one was there to be there.",Monaco,post-race,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"It was nice. The feeling after a qualifying lap is always very special here. Really, really happy about the lap. The excitement is so high that it feels really good. However, I know more often than not in the past, qualifying is not everything. As much as it helps a lot for Sunday's race, we need to put everything together coming Sunday. And in the past years, we didn't manage to do so. But we are a stronger team. We are in a stronger position. And I'm sure we can achieve great things tomorrow. And obviously, the win is the target. I need a good launch. I need a good launch off the grid. And then once we do that, then hopefully Carlos can have a great start and follow me into Turn 1 and be 1-2. And if we are 1-2, then we can manage that as a team. That would be the perfect scenario. But whatever happens, we just need to bring that victory home. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you. Merci à tous, vraiment. It feels as good as the first one. I think in Monaco, the emotions you get, the tension that you have before getting into the car is so much more than anywhere else on the calendar. So yeah, once you finish the lap and you hear that you're on pole position, it's always a very special feeling. However, maybe in the past the emotions were staying for longer, but now obviously having started twice on pole and not bringing the victory, which is at the end what matters the most, is where my mind is at the moment, just trying to prepare and make everything possible. It's been a bit of a roller coaster. The weekend has been incredible until after FP3 where there was an issue with my engine and there was an engine swap at the very last minute, which was quite tricky. But fortunately for me, there wasn't any consequence for my weekend. Yeah, I mean, I felt something strange, but actually after that, the feeling was fine. No, no, we were... In Q1 it was very tricky, I took that sticker, that sponsor sticker on the lap. That was pretty important at that time, which slowed us down quite a bit. Then we pitted, we took off the sponsor banner from the front wing, we went again. So that was already quite tricky, because in qualifying in Monaco you just want to be out and just do normal laps, so I was just praying for no yellow flags or red flags after that. Luckily for me, it was okay. Then in Q2, we struggled a little bit more with the balance of the car. I couldn't find the right feeling. But then in Q3, we did some modifications, especially with the front wing and the tools and my driving, and then I found the pace again, so I was a little bit happier in Q3. But the feeling was, for some reason, a bit better in FP2, FP3. I think 2022, I unfortunately couldn't finish the lap in Q3, the second lap in Q3, because there was the red flag for Checo. I think this would have been quite a bit better, and I think the car was in an even better place back then, because it was a very smooth qualifying. It's all about the build-up in Monaco, and maybe in [this] qualifying we didn't have the smoothest of build-up, but that doesn't mean I'm not happy with the lap. I'm extremely happy with the lap. I'm very, very happy with the car and it's been a really good weekend until now. But as I said, we shouldn't get carried away with the pole position. As always, we just try to approach every race the same. Obviously, having in mind that it's Monaco here, track position is very important, and we'll try to maximise our race and take that victory. Yeah, all of what I said is very obvious, but we are just trying to approach it as a normal race, and that's what we'll do. Well, I didn't see many times people losing into Turn 1, so I guess it's a very short run down to Turn 1. But never say never. Obviously, we'll focus on the start and we'll see what happens. No, it felt better everywhere. I think what we struggled with the most coming to quali and the thing that is most difficult to actually counter, which normally we always try to anticipate the new conditions, but one thing you cannot really anticipate is that you are going faster through a corner. And that means with the bumps they are in Monaco, the wheel lifting and just the amount of time you pass in the air with the wheels not touching the ground is just quite a bit more compared to FP3 because of the increased speed around the corners. And that made it a lot more tricky to actually feel the balance and to just be on the limit and be consistent. So I was a little bit less consistent. Then I started to be a bit more aggressive with the front wing to have a bit more load and help that, and that was a bit better. As I said, I think the best feeling of the weekend was FP2, FP3. However, in quali, it was still good, and it was still the best out of everybody, and I think we've got a great car but it was just a bit of a trickier session to put everything together, but I'm happy we did so for Q3. No. No, no, no. Nothing different. At the end, we did the job on the Saturday and then the only thing I can do is to try and focus on the Sunday's race and do the best we can do as a team. But as I've said, I think in the past there were some mistakes. We were in different situations. I think the team has got a lot stronger since then. As I said, we'll approach this race as all the others, and I'm confident that we'll do a great job. In FP1, yes. But I prefer to have FP2, FP3 as positive as it was. But when you have such a good FP2, FP3, and also FP1, you go into quali knowing that you've got everything to lose. And if you don't take pole position, then you look completely stupid. The pressure was still quite a lot on, but we managed to pull it off, which was really nice. And obviously, as I mentioned earlier, with the change of engine at the last minute, that wasn't making me any more calm. So it was a bit of a tense quali going into qualifying. I think just the same, but in the good direction this time. And this year, I think we've had a very good kerb riding compared to the others. I think this is a strength. So yeah, kerb riding has been very good since the beginning of the weekend. And I think that gave us a lot of consistency around a track like here, especially in low-grip conditions like this was the case in free practices. So that was positive. No, not at all. I think the tension, the peak of the tension actually of the whole season, I would say, is in qualifying in Monaco. Then for the race, it's not like you are more relaxed, but, well, yeah, actually you are more relaxed just because the race, you've got to focus on the start, you've got to focus around the pit stop, because obviously the laps around the pit stop are extremely important, but... Yeah, the qualifying in Monaco is a big part of the job. It is true that in the past we didn't have the success that we wanted, but I don't want to think about that anymore. And I'm pretty sure that it will be a good one this weekend. I haven't thought about it too much. I had lots of other things to think of until now. And my priority was to have the right qualifying position, which now is done. However, now we have to focus on the race and I cannot afford to start thinking about how it will feel if this happens. I think I have more to gain in focusing on the process to get there and what can we do in what we control until tomorrow's race to put everything together and to give us the best chances in order to win the race tomorrow. The championship is still long. I don't think one race is going to change everything for us. So, yeah, we've got to stay calm. And I think it's too early to think about that. I think Red Bull has still got the strongest car on the grid. However, it's true that on a track like this that is so specific, they didn't have the best car and they struggled a lot more. But that doesn't mean that it will be the case until the end of the season. So, yeah, too early to say. I mean we are we are family. So starting on the front row both of us will have a meeting with my mum tonight and I'm sure she will calm us down and hopefully I can get through Turn 1 in the first position and Oscar in the second place. But yeah, let's see. Obviously I think… [To Carlos] Do you want me to adopt you as well? Don't be jealous, Carlos. Whenever you want. Whenever you want. I think she has availability. And she will find some for you, for sure. So, yeah, I think that we just need to focus on ourselves. We can only control what we can do best, and that starts with a good start. If we have a good start, I have little doubt that we'll keep that position into Turn 1. And we've had good starts recently, so I'm not too worried. I mean, it's a short run compared to everyone else. I don't know. I might try and bribe your mum to let me go through, but I don't know. It's a short run, obviously, and, you know, it is Monaco still, but the race isn't all won and lost at Turn 1. There's still some things you can do. You can put pressure on and make the right strategy calls, and it can still get you through. So, yeah, it's not the be-all and end-all, but it would certainly make life a bit easier. Yeah, I don't struggle too much to sleep, so I think I should be fine. Yeah, yeah. I mean, once you are in the car, actually, you feel so good. Or at least I felt so good and everything goes away. It's more the two hours in between FP3 to quali, that there you start to feel a little bit the tension, that you know that you need to prepare everything, that you need to anticipate track conditions, and all of this. But as soon as I put the helmet and then I'm in the car, I'm completely fine, and I really don't feel anything anymore.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Good question. I mean, I think if you took the second half of my first lap in Q3 and the first half of the second one, it would have been enough. But, yeah, just a couple of mistakes at the end. But, you know, credit to Charles. He's been incredibly quick all weekend. At certain points, I don't think anyone thought we were going to get close to him. So, yeah, nice to be starting on the front row. I feel like it's been a good weekend in terms of building momentum. And, yeah, what better colours to do it in than these? A bit of both. I mean, a good start always helps. And if you can get into the lead, then you can control it very easily around here. So that's probably the first goal. And if not, then with strategy. Because, yeah, as optimistic as I want to be, overtaking around here is not easy. So we'll try our best, but starting from a good spot and yeah, a chance for a good day tomorrow. Yeah, I think on the whole, very happy with it. We were struggling a little bit through the weekend. We didn't really know quite where we sat. A bit of work to do after FP3, but the car felt very good in qualifying. I think the last lap of Q3, there are a few corners I wish I could have again, but yeah, when you're pushing so hard, it's kind of inevitable that there's going to be mistakes here and there. So no, very happy with it. I think the pace in the car was good. And yeah, I think for a Monaco qualifying, it went reasonably smoothly. I hit the wall pretty hard in Q2, so that was a bit of a scare. Apart from that, it was a smooth qualifying and happy to be on the front row and hopefully staying on the front row this week. Yeah, I think Turn 5 and Turn 10, the chicane after the tunnel, were not my best. I think the rest of the lap was pretty solid, just struggled a little bit in those two corners. Whether it would have been enough for pole, I'm not sure. Yeah, I mean, for me, it's pretty pointless saying if you could have done... Max summed it up very well a few weeks ago. I won't repeat it, but it's a good analogy, and I think everybody can say the same. So, yeah, pretty happy with it on the whole. Yes, I think so. I think we came into this weekend pretty confident that we could be in the fight for pole and the win again. I think going into qualifying, maybe we weren't as convinced this week, but no, it felt good. Yeah, pretty hooked up in qualifying. And I think for me, you know, we say Imola and Monaco are very different circuits, but both of them need a lot of commitment. You know, Imola, you get it a bit wrong, you're in the gravel trap and the wall. Here, there's no gravel trap, it's just the wall. So they're both two pretty big commitment tracks, obviously here being a step above everywhere. But yeah, maybe a bit more similar than people think. I mean, the run to Turn 1 is always your best chance at any track. Here, obviously, it's a very short run, like we know. Yeah, the strategy, you can try something because unless there's a massive pace difference, which I'm pretty sure there won't be, then overtaking is impossible here. So, yeah, it'll be won or lost in the pits, probably. So make sure we have a good day. I don't think it changes the world. For me, I always try to not think about the end results so much. I think for me, leaving a weekend satisfied with what I've done in my control is a more important thing. I think the last two weekends, especially Imola, have been very much the case. I think I've put myself in a good position for a good result tomorrow. Yeah, you know, I'm not really concerned with whatever the result is. I want to get through the race, getting to the end of the weekend going, ‘I don't think I could have done anything more than that’. So that would be more meaningful to me. Of course, if you get a trophy at the end, especially the biggest one, then it feels nice, but I think the momentum in the last few weekends is definitely already helping with results that in the history books mean not a lot. So, it would be nice, but if I can leave this weekend thinking I've not been able to do anything more that would mean more to me. I think I got the start of the question. For me, Monaco qualifying is the most exciting session of the whole year. I think for us as drivers, I think for the fans watching, Yeah, I think if there's one session you want to watch for the whole year, it's the session we just had. So yeah, for me, it gives you a feeling like nowhere else, especially when you put a good lap together. It's very, very satisfying here. And yeah, I don't really have more than that. Will I sleep? I hope so. Yes, I mean, of course I will. I think the adrenaline is always there on a race weekend. But yeah, I should be fine, I hope.",Monaco,post-qualifying,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I think overall it was an improvement for me. I've been struggling all weekend with confidence and feeling with the car. So overall, to step it up and be P3 was a step forward. Obviously not entirely happy because I wish I could have been fighting for pole position. But the truth is that Charles has been doing an outstanding job. The car has been amazing all this weekend and he managed to extract the most out of it. And yeah, I'm happy for him. Yeah, definitely. Yesterday, I looked very quick on the long run, so for some reason, this weekend, I've been struggling on the short runs, and the long run seemed much better, which is something we will need to look into, but I'm confident that tomorrow the pace in the long run will be good. It's just a matter of track position here, and we've lost it with not a great quali position. But, you know, it's Monaco. Anything can happen, like always, and we will give it our best shot, but the priority will be to win with Charles tomorrow. Well, just summing up the weekend in general, it's been a bit of a struggle for me right from the beginning. I haven't been as confident as I normally am around Monaco and I haven't been at my best. Luckily, we stepped it up for quali and in quali I was feeling one step better. Unfortunately, it was a bit too late and I was still lacking those last couple of tenths from confidence. Anyway, very happy to see Charles putting it on pole and the team having such a strong car around Monaco and being in a position to win the race with Charles tomorrow. Overall, I think I'm very happy for the team. A bit unfortunate that the weekend that I've struggled the most with the car has to be in Monaco, where qualifying is so important. Just a lack of confidence. Like Oscar was saying, you need a lot of commitment around here, and maybe this lack of confidence around another track would be half a tenth to a tenth of commitment. In Monaco means it's two or three tenths. Luckily for quali, as I said, i stepped it up and I was a bit closer but there were stages of the weekend that I was really, really lacking, really struggling, which is a bit of a new thing for me around Monaco because I've normally felt really comfortable around here. So something we will have to look into. but yeah, keeping the positives, we managed to save the weekend with a with a decent couple of laps in Q3, and we will go from there tomorrow. Just a bit of inconsistency. I've had a lot of moments in practice, and when you have so many moments of nearly touching the wall, nearly having a session over when you're so close to the walls, this immediately takes away confidence. And I've had a lot of those during the practice, and it meant that for some reason I was just lacking confidence from then onwards. But, yeah, just losing the rear in places where you don't expect to lose it and then never getting quite close to the walls as I wish, because I had to leave myself a bit of margin in case the rear was snapping on me. So, yeah, as I said, not ideal, but we managed to save it. We will see what we can do at the start, what we can do with strategy in order to do every single bit possible to help Charles to go and get that win. He's been driving amazing all weekend. I think part of that delta comes from Charles also being super committed and having a particularly strong weekend. This weekend I think he's been on it since FP1 and he's been extremely quick. So yeah, we will do everything we can to win the race tomorrow. You know, I need a haircut from your mom here. I need to find a new hairdresser in Monaco. I think in a normal race it's impossible and then the focus will be, like I said before, to see what we can do with the two cars to win the race with Charles, that he's in the best possible position to do so. Then obviously Monaco, you never know, all sorts of things can happen, but if I win tomorrow it’s probably because something weird has happened with Charles with strategy or with Safety Cars that I hope they don't in a way. Obviously, we all want to win, but at the same time, I feel like Charles deserves to win in Monaco after his unlucky run. He's been extremely strong all week, all weekend, and here in the past, so, yeah, tomorrow is a day to kind of wish that nothing happens and see if we can win with Charles. Same. I'm a good sleeper. Seven, eight hours should be fine for me. If there's one day maybe you don't sleep, it's Friday to Saturday after Friday I had, but I managed to sleep, so all good for tomorrow.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"I'm feeling good. Obviously, it's always a very special feeling, the Monaco week. I think it is for all the drivers, but for me specifically, having grown up here, it’s extra special, so I'm really looking forward to it. We've always been competitive here, so I hope it will be just the same this weekend. However, the finality of the weekend hasn't ever been the one I wanted, which we have worked on a lot. We've done our preparation in the best possible way. I hope that this weekend will be the good one. Not much. I mean, second or third is not really something that excites me. So the win is what we need to target. We've seen in the last few races that Red Bull, McLaren and ourselves are pretty close in qualifying. And we know how important qualifying is here. So we'll have to put everything together. And if we're on pole, then that will give us good chances to get what we want, which is the win. I feel like in Monaco, you always start a little bit from scratch. As much as what we've seen in the last few races, I think it won't be too different. There still can be some surprises. We've seen it in 2021, I think, with us, where we were nowhere but then we got to Monaco and our car was working very well. So we'll have to see after Friday where we are compared to the others. But I will be surprised if we are not in the mix for pole, at least. I think what you have in Monaco that you have maybe a little bit less on other tracks, on other city tracks as well, is just a risk assessment. And that's where a driver can make a bit more the difference by taking more risk. It either pays off or not at all. But this is something that I particularly appreciate from this track. As soon as you try and go a bit more on the limit, you straight away see it on the lap time. And obviously coming into Q3, having done so many laps, you start to get pretty close with the walls. But it's exciting. I don't get that feeling anywhere else on the calendar. So I think risk assessment is what makes the difference here in Monaco. I guess to my family, to my friends. This has never really changed. I'm always the person I was before getting into Formula 1. But I was actually having the discussion yesterday. I had an event in the centre of Monaco and I could see people I was in school with, taking pictures of myself, when actually 10 or 15 years ago I was just in the middle of everybody and nobody was expecting that. So it's funny. It's strange that the perception of others changes so much. At the end I'm always the same person. However, of course, in a very different position than what I was back then. I guess for my family and my friends, I'm always the same person, which is important to have those people around me. Helps to keep your feet on the ground, which is important because in Formula 1, it's a world that is a bit apart. So yeah, it's good to have those people around me. No, it's not a concern. Obviously we have seen it in the last race a little bit. We've seen it in Jeddah a little bit, but i think it's more the way we manage everything and it's not something that is set in stone that we cannot change short term. So we just have to look into it, but it's no big deal. But it seems that Red Bull and McLaren was on the positive side of things in Imola and we missed a little bit of time on that. We have looked into it. I don't think that here it will make such a difference. It's a very different situation we are in. However, it can for the rest of the season. So we've done a proper analysis on our side and I'm sure we'll grow from that. I am probably the worst person to ask that to. I love football. I love playing football. Unfortunately, as you said, the Nazionale Piloti game was cancelled, which is a shame, but I hope it can come back next year. However, I haven't really followed until now. I'll probably watch the last game, but I haven't watched until now, so I don't have much more to comment on that. I don't want to kill the excitement but I wouldn't jump to conclusions too early. I mean it's been the last race has been pretty close. the one before as well. it was two particular tracks. It is also true that the two next tracks are also quite particular, being Monaco and Canada where kerb-riding is so important. And as Max said, it might not show the strength of their car. So I think we've got to wait a little bit more to try and understand exactly where we are in terms of performance. However, we are confident of our steps forward done with our upgrades. And we really hope that it will be enough to close the gap and to be soon on a par with them. And that will be great for Formula 1 in general. That's what we want. Yeah, I couldn't agree more on the weight limit that we have all mentioned. I follow it obviously more since two years, since Ferrari joined in the Hypercar category, and even more so this year as I've got my younger brother that started his endurance career in GT. So yeah, now I'm a bit more involved and following closer the whole category. Oh, for sure. I mean, I would love to do Le Mans one day. I think we all have the same problem. The programme in Formula 1 now is crazy. It's crazy. And we've got very little time spare to prepare properly a race like Le Mans, because if I do Le Mans, I want to arrive there ready and there to go and win. So we've got to do the things seriously. And at the moment with the calendar of Formula 1, it's quite difficult. But I would love to partner with my younger brother to do Le Mans one day together. Hangover is a cool one, but actually Harry Potter was probably my favourite growing up, and it remains one of my favorite movies. Oh yeah, big fan, huge fan! What? Yeah, I knew the lines. When I was 10 years old, I knew the lines of the movie. Yeah, of course. Everybody was telling me I was looking like Harry Potter as well. Yeah, but I'm a bit worried about what you're going to say next. Keep that video for yourself!",Monaco,thursday,Ferrari
Alex Albon,"I would say, generally, the philosophy of the car should improve the car around this kind of track. So, marginally optimistic. Let's see. I think generally we've made a step forward in low-speed corners this year. And obviously, Monaco, that is it. For me, I would say it's all of Sector 3. I think it's quite flowing around there. This feeling of just glancing around the walls and that's a lot of fun. You start to touch them a few times and then it's just about how much margin is it before a wheel starts coming off. But that part is, at least for me, the most fun. It's more just about Saturday though. I think that's what makes it special. When you think about qualifying laps and the feeling of, you know, it's not so much of a Sunday race for the drivers, I would say, it's more focusing on Saturday and when you deliver those laps in qualifying, with the adrenaline in your body, that's pretty cool. Yeah, same as Charles. I would say that it's not really a pressure in terms of comparing yourself to rivals or whatever, but it's more just yourself. And it's kind of this feeling of, you know, how much risk are you taking? And that bit is exciting. I think it's one of the few races, as Charles said, maybe the only race, where you finish a lap and you feel like you've put it on the line. So that's pretty unique. OK. I would say mostly, you know, the first thing was the feeling of being up to speed all the time. I think from the first lap, I think you see it, even in FP1s, there's quite a big push on for Max to set purples early on. And he's just quick. I think there's not really anything to it. As Max has said, it's something that we all strive for. It's not having weaknesses. And, you know, whenever you do have a weakness, you work on it and you try to get rid of it. I think Max has kind of not got an area where you can really find an edge, so it makes it difficult. Yeah, I'm the same. I think it's definitely something that every driver most probably has on their bucket list, their to-do list. I would love to do a race with some of these guys, maybe my family as well. I don't know how I would do it, but definitely it’s up there. And I don't know, just imagine like we're all sharing a motorhome or an RV together and just... It would be good. I can see it now. But yes, I think weight, as everyone said, I think especially the taller guys would most probably need to chop off an arm to be competitive. But otherwise, yeah, it's going to happen at some point, I think. I like the Grand Budapest Hotel. Wes Anderson. That's cool. I was about to say, with glasses, you would look like Harry Potter.",Monaco,thursday,Williams
Max Verstappen,"It's a completely different track. I think, looking at the track layout, it's probably not going to be our best track, just because our car normally struggles a bit over bumps and kerbs. We did work on it a bit compared to last year. I think so far, on most of the tracks that we've been to, our low-speed performance has improved a little bit. But I don't think this is going to be a very easy weekend. But I think Monaco never is very straightforward, even when you are supposed to have the best car. Monaco is a very tricky track to get everything to work, get the tyres to work, in a quali lap, for example, red flags, there's always a lot of disruption and a lot of things can go right, but also a lot of things can go wrong. So yeah, we just need to be on it. Of course, Imola started off really bad and we managed to turn it around. I wouldn't want to have a weekend like that again. It's quite stressful and not nice, but we know that this is a more difficult track for us, even though we have won here in the past. It's quite complicated so we'll see where we're at tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, naturally from outside, I think it is one of the more difficult tracks for us. Plus, in the last few years, I think Ferrari has always been very, very strong here. Plus, McLaren lately, the last two races, have really ramped up in performance. So they for sure are the ones to watch as well. And in Monaco, you might have some surprises. I mean, last year, Esteban did an amazing lap as well in qualifying. So these kind of things in Monaco, they can happen when someone feels really good. and confident, so we'll see what happens. Yeah, I mean, I think after Miami, it was quite clear when we went into Imola, it had all closed up quite a bit, even though Imola was probably also not our easiest weekend. But for sure, Monaco is always like that anyway. And it will depend now who will put more performance on the car, find the best possible set-up on the car. But, for sure, things have closed up which makes, I think from our side, makes it of course very important to try and be at our very best, 100%. I know that is not always a very realistic possibility, but you always try to get to a certain point and maybe the last few races we haven't been operating at that but, yeah, every single weekend we try again and try to find the best possible set-up in the car. But for sure, you can see it's definitely closing up. I find that really difficult to comment on. I can just speak from my experience in Formula 1, where I think over time, you have a lot more experience. I think you know how to handle certain situations a bit better. Plus, being at the front for quite a few years, as a team, also the way we operate, I think it can make a difference to teams that are trying to chase that. We just try to stay calm and collected. We know that the last few races teams have been catching up or have beaten us, so of course we want to try and improve as well. But I do think with the experience that we've had over the last few years, it makes us a very tough team to beat in a championship because we don't make many mistakes. Of course, naturally, you try to always optimise everything, and that's, I think, in life in general – you keep on learning, you keep on trying to be better. But I think that does make us very dangerous in a championship fight. I mean, my teams are not in the final, so for me, it doesn't matter who wins the final. I mean, I like to watch it. I will watch it. But when you don't have a particular favourite, you just try to have a good game in front of you, right? And, yeah, I hope that happens. Also, for some players, maybe, you know, here and there, it's going to be their final match with their team, so it can be quite emotional, I think, in Champions League, for sure, for two players in the two different teams. So, yeah, it's always quite special, I think. So I will enjoy watching that. I literally don't care because my team is not in it, so I'm just watching. I think it's a good idea. Like I said before, it's always a very, very difficult weekend to get everything together and be on pole here. So I don't want to really think ahead too far. Of course, the start of the year in terms of qualifying has been new to me as well. I think so far it's been going really well in qualifying. So of course I'll try to, but it's not a guarantee, not a given, especially around Monaco. Well, hopefully nothing too intimidating, but, you know, you're such a rookie, you know, that there's so many things that you still have to learn. I mean, for me personally, the biggest one was actually doing a full race distance, you know. Like, in F3 at the time, you know, you did 35 minute races. So, you know, there's a lot more involved. Looking after your tyres is a big part of it. You know, these tyres are so particular and sensitive compared to some other categories. Of course, in F2, F3, you're running on Pirellis already. But for me at the time, that wasn't the case. But yeah, just, you know, going through the good moments, the bad moments, how you come out of these things, difficult weekends, where it's just not working for you or whatever. Like, there's so much to learn. But on the other hand, also, don't try to think about it too much. Just let it go. When you're talented – and you can see that with Kimi, he's very talented – I don't think you should be too worried, you know, just... make mistakes. I mean you have to make mistakes. Ideally, of course, you like to make those mistakes when you're not fighting for championships or whatever, so I also got lucky with that, you know, starting at Toro Rosso at the time, not many people are looking at you all the time, so you can make some silly mistakes here and there. But it's important to make them because even though you tell yourself all the time I cannot do this or I cannot do that, you will only adapt really if you make them and then move forward. And yeah, just in general, growing up as a person as well, I guess, even outside the car, knowing what you want in your private life. And then it's just understanding the set-up of a racing car more and more over time. Of course cars evolve, but when you're with one particular team, at one point you know more or less what works or not. Being with the same kind of race engineers and people around you that fine tune the car for you, all these kind of things, the more you spend time with them, the more it comes to you. But again, don't try to think about it too much, just let it happen. When you're that young, just focus on trying to go as fast as you can, make your mistakes, you know, have good race results and just, yeah. Well, try not to think about it too much. Now you can explain all of this, but at the time you don't know that, right? So it's like, just ease into it. And then you have good people around you normally in the team that will coach you around this. I think the last three years have been great already! No, but of course in all seriousness I think it's good that you see other teams, they are also becoming more and more competitive – I guess naturally with the regulations, how they are. Over time people learn more and more what direction that they have to push into and it's good for the sport, you know, that more teams are fighting for the win. Yuki, I need you as my teammate there. You're so light, you'll be flying. You can compensate for my weight! For sure. I mean, I remember when I was like 11, 12 years old, my dad was racing at Le Mans in LMP2 and then LMP1 the year after. It is something pretty incredible. I mean, even at the time, you know, you're a young kid, but just the whole atmosphere is fantastic. And the team element of it, because it's not only you, right? You have to work together with your team-mates to try and find the right compromise with the set-up. So, yeah, I've been following it a lot here and there you have a few chats as well. But at the moment, I think it's too early for me to enter because the new regulations as well, I think they need to sort out the BOP a little bit better between the cars. Like, it's a bit hit and miss here and there, I find. Plus, for me, also the driver weight. I feel like there needs to be a limit on that, because I might rock up, 80 kilos with kit, but there is also a driver that can be 55 or 60. No offence, Yuki! And I find like, when you go to Le Mans, you have no chance. You know, that already is a couple of tenths a lap. It's pretty incredible, the difference. So they need to sort that out. There needs to be an average or minimum, you know, weight that you need to comply to. But for sure in the future, I would like to race. Yeah, it's an incredible event. Wolf of Wall Street or Hangover, yeah. You're not making it any better! I would like to see that one. Yeah, I do think compared to like any other street circuit, because it's so narrow, I find it's even more challenging. And especially in qualifying, you can feel like your heart rate, you know, just the adrenaline rush you get around here. You don't really get that on any other... Ha! He was ready to take off! Just, yeah, [Monaco] is something else. I mean, yeah, I'm not a fan of street circuits, but for sure in qualifying here, you know, the attention to detail. Yeah, it's crazy. And yeah, that definitely makes it very special. I do think that up until the point I didn't win here, you know, the pressure of wanting to win. Monaco was always very high. You really wanted to show off. But I feel like that's a bit different now. You're probably a bit more relaxed. Of course, in qualifying, you go for it. But I approach it more as just another weekend where, of course, I would like to win, but it's very important to just score points and don't do anything silly. No, for sure. I mean, I think everyone should think like that, especially I think after their last two races, you know, they are really in the mix. Of course, there are quite a few points down at the moment. But, you know, if you suddenly start winning, then, you know, it can turn around quite quickly. And from our side, you know, we just keep on trying to improve our package. And my approach has always been the same. You know, that doesn't matter about anyone else involved or another team involved. We just have to focus on ourselves, you know, because that's the only thing that we can control. Well, it doesn't work like that. I mean, I think we still have a very, very fast car. And if you look at the average of the season so far, I think we do have the fastest car. Otherwise, you're not leading the championship. But I'm happy where I'm at. There's so much investment going on as well with the engine side of things. And I'm happy. We just need to keep on working, keep on trying to improve our package. But yeah, that's the only thing that I'm thinking about at the moment. I mean, I think if you start thinking like that, you can almost change at one point every single race if you want to change to another team or whatever. But it's not on my mind.",Monaco,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, the car is definitely more balanced through the lap now. We were struggling a lot at the start of the year, balancing the high- to low-speed corners. And I think we have made progress. when you look at the gap to Red Bull, when you look at the gap to the rest of the midfield, we have moved forward. But I do think it's fair to say Ferrari and McLaren have moved forward at the same rate. So we need to keep on working, bringing those upgrades to the car. And the whole team are working flat out right now to bring those upgrades as quick as possible. I think as the guys have been saying, Monaco is so challenging. There are so many disruptions throughout the whole weekend and you just need to find that sweet spot. The track's evolving so much, it's getting faster and faster, often up to three seconds quicker in qualifying than it is in a practice one. So even if you have a good Friday, you need to be ready to adapt moving into Saturday. And, you know, we saw today. I was sort of in the engineering meeting and it was bright blue sunshine and I came out and it was pouring down with rain. So that could add some spice to things. I think we've known all season that we struggle to balance high- to low-speed. We can either get it quite competitive in low-speed and we struggle at high speed or vice versa. So we are hoping that with relatively consistent corner speeds at this circuit, that we should be slightly more competitive. Yeah, I agree with Esteban. We obviously have laps deleted all the time in qualifying for track limits. I think if you were to cause a yellow flag or red flag, you should probably have your best lap deleted. Yeah, nothing more to say about that. Yeah, I think, you know, Kimi is a fantastic driver, obviously racing in Formula 2 this year, but he's no doubt going to be a Formula 1 driver in the future and he's a fellow junior driver as well, coming through the ranks, as I did with the team. So I think it makes for a great opportunity for Mercedes building into the future. But as I said before, I'd welcome anybody as my team-mate. I feel like I've got a pretty good team-mate right now as it is. So yeah, welcome anybody. Always really excited to go to Silverstone, but I think we are on a really good trajectory at the moment. We are bringing upgrades really quickly to the car, which we are confident will bring performance. Historically, we have always gone well around Silverstone as well and I think now we are entering the European season things are a little bit more consistent, less Sprint races as well. We know from the past we are really good at building throughout the season so we are hoping by Silverstone we are going to be in that fight with the guys in front of us. Yeah, I think definitely after my Formula 1 career, I would love to race in Le Mans and maybe even do it with some guys who are in F1 at the moment, I think it would be quite cool… Well, Alex and I spoke like a couple of years ago about doing like a GT race or something together, but I don't know who you'd want. But like Max said, I think, how things are in Le Mans at the moment, such a great championship, but iit is quite unfair to the guys of our weight. We're all sort of 80 kilos with our kit and our helmets. And you know, Yuki would have six tenths on us before we even start. So, but as I said, I think it's a very special race. I think we're all racers. Well, 20 kilos, 20 kilos. I think 20 kilos, six tenths a lap? Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I think, as I said, we're all racers and, you know, we love racing in Formula 1 and that takes all of our effort. But in the future, for sure, we want to explore some of these awesome races. I always remember watching James Bond Casino Royale when I was a kid, so that was always my number one. I have a video, one of the very first videos I have on my phone is of Charles, 2012, with the long hair. I don't know if you remember, it was in... Ortona? Is it the Italian WSK? You put the broomstick between your legs and you're doing the sort of the wizard... It was a photo! Yeah I mean ordinarily 2026 seems like a long time away but in the world of Formula 1 it's going to be here tomorrow and the team are feeling really confident for this era. I think you know the experience of the team have had, the success in 2014 with the new powertrain, and then obviously the time in Formula E, the work that was done with the Hypercar. There are a lot of individuals within HPP who have got so much experience with this future technology. So I think that leaves us in a really great place to have a great engine. And the work Petronas are doing on the fuel as well is looking really strong. So on the engine side, I think we're feeling very confident for that era.",Monaco,thursday,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, feeling good for sure. The team also helped me for sure. The car performance this year, is very consistent, easy to adapt as well. So generally, initially already from FP1, we have good pace. So yeah, very happy, as a team, as well to keep being able to extract performance [like in] previous races and so far enjoying as well. Yeah, I think I'm feeling more optimistic compared to probably, yeah, before Imola or whatever. But actually, Imola, we had a bit of a surprise with the amount of performance we had in the race week. It can be opposite as well, so we never know. But, yeah, I had a good memory last year, so I'm feeling more confident for sure compared to the first year in Monaco. And, yeah, if the team can perform well, as much as Imola, that would be great. Yeah, I mean, so far very happy with the VCARB. I mean, now we're fighting, like, almost... Yeah, sometimes like even P7 or P8, so I mean other options… and like probably now the top teams are pretty much taken so… I mean, probably we're the strongest team in the midfield at least. We'll see. I think, obviously, especially when I'm in Red Bull, you want to always aim for Red Bull. But, you know, if they don't want me or, you know, they're not expecting me into the seat, yeah, if I've got an interesting offer that could be better than even VCARB or Red Bull, yeah, I'll think about it. But I also have a big loyalty to Red Bull as without them I wouldn't be here. And obviously Honda as well. And speaking of Honda, maybe Aston Martin, but you know, Aston also, they’re taken by two drivers. So yeah, I mean, it's pretty open, but so far I'm happy with VCARB. Le Mans? Sorry, I was not listening to the question. Next year, Le Mans? Yes. One day, yes. I think. I'm sorry, I'm very off now. Next drivers, please! I think I’ve found my dream job! I love the Transporter, Jason Statham. I love Jason Statham, so yeah, he's my guy.",Monaco,thursday,RB
Esteban Ocon,"For sure, last year was a great memory. But I think we'll keep fit to the ground for this year. I think we've had a difficult start of the season where we've struggled to get into the top 10 very much. We only got one point as a team. So for us, it's going to be important to try and maximise everything this year, try and build on the confidence, try and see if we can improve the weaknesses out of the car and yeah, see where that leads up until qualifying. But no, we don't expect to be on the podium this weekend. I think it has improved, but we started very far. We started on the last row this season and we end up being now regularly into Q2 and close to the top ten. So there are improvements, but they are small improvements that we are doing every time. Yes, I feel at this track you can usually extract a little bit more, you know, in terms of driving, getting close to the wall, taking risks. That usually pays in your favour if you do a good lap. But at the moment, you know, we struggle with the car and we need to see where we'll end up in terms of result. Well, it was because I touched the wall twice! But, you know, yeah, as Charles said, I think that's very exciting. You know, once you start to feel that you are putting a very good lap together, there's no feeling like it. And what is stressful, I would say, is, you know, in Saturday, having the most important part of the weekend, it’s usually 80% of your weekend, but there it's probably 99%. And that's what makes it more stressful, the Saturdays, compared to a normal weekend. I think, if I'm correct, that's being looked at by the FIA. I think recently we've discussed that in some drivers' meetings, that a situation where a driver would cause a red flag would be monitored. So I think that should be something sensible to be doing because we've seen in the past drivers causing issues and the others not being able to do a lap. Yeah, that should be something that the FA monitors, I think. I mean, at the moment, we are progressing. You know, we are improving step by step, doing little steps, of course. But yeah, I think you are kind of prompting me to a future question around here. But yeah, I'm basically focusing on what I have to do race by race, trying to optimise everything I can, you know, working well with my engineers. And, you know, at the moment, there's nothing else that I'm thinking about. And that should be the most important thing. As I’ve always said, if you do a good job on track there should be nothing stopping you in the future, so we will see. Yeah, I've been following very much, also Alpine races in Hypercar at the moment and I will be in Le Mans as well for the 24 hours. It's great to see so many different manufacturers racing on the top class. And seeing so many cool fights as well. As I've always said, you know, Formula 1 is my target. It's what I want to be racing for a long time at the moment. But never say never. And for sure, at some stage, this is something I will be eyeing to. I think it's not the right moment now, no. Clearly not. But one day, for sure, if there's the opportunity, you know, to race in Le Mans, yeah, that's something I would love to do, you know, but not in the same time as Formula 1. When the good times arrive. Six tenths a lap!? Yeah, I was in Cannes on Monday. I'm a massive Marvel fan, comics fan, and I got the chance to be sitting very close to Sebastian Stan, who was playing in the movie The Apprentice, which was quite a crazy experience. And yeah, to reply to the question, probably my favourite movie of all time is The Dark Knight Rises.",Monaco,thursday,Alpine
Max Verstappen,"I mean, the whole race I had to push flat out. Maybe we had an issue. On the Medium tyres, we were quite strong. On the Hard tyres, it was just a bit more difficult to manage, and especially the last 10 or 15 laps, I had no grip anymore. I was really sliding a lot. I saw Lando closing in. So the last 10 laps it was just flat out. It's very difficult when the tyres aren't working anymore and you have to go flat out. I couldn't afford to make too many mistakes. Luckily, we didn't and super happy of course to win here today. I mean, we changed a lot on the car. Of course we didn't have a lot of information going into the race. Maybe that's why on the Hard tyres it was a bit more difficult for us. But I think from where we started the weekend to now, I mean we can be incredibly pleased with the pole and the win, so I will take that. Yeah, I think first of all, in the race, like on the Mediums, I think it was very good. I didn't expect that kind of pace after what we did so far in the weekend. But we could have somehow keep the balance together. So that felt really nice. But then as soon as I swapped to the Hard tyres, it was definitely... I mean, maybe not the first five to 10 laps, but after that I was like, I'm not sure I can bring this to the end, you know, because the tyres just fell out of the operating window and yeah, it was just like driving on ice really snappy and just you can feel when the tyres are not gripping up anymore like Turn 7, I almost ended up in the grandstand for my feeling, at some point. Just very difficult, really weird lines that I had to take. Those last 10 laps you know I was really trying to survive with the tyres and then suddenly Lando really picked up pace. So, yeah, I could see him, of course, catch up. I was not sure if I could keep him behind, but I was just trying to do the best I could, pushing as hard as I could with the grip that I had. And, yeah, luckily, it was just enough laps. Well, I mean, as soon as it was like half a second a lap, I was like, whoa, that's a lot. But the other hand, you can't do anything about it. So I was just trying to do my pace. You cannot suddenly try and force a half a second out of it when you don't have the balance. So I was just trying to really not make mistakes, really try to drive around the balance issues that I had and be quick on the straight. So that's basically what I think helped me a bit at the end. Also, with the rear wing that we had, we were quite fast on the straight. And yeah, that probably helped a bit in the last few laps to defend. Yeah, Friday we were nowhere in the long runs. I had no good feeling at all. Even on Saturday morning, we tried another long run and that was also severely off, so not happy at all. But then I think already going into qualifying, the car felt a lot better. So I knew that today was going to be better, but I had no clue how much better. And we also didn’t have a lot of tyre data, so maybe we did something wrong with that, you know. Maybe it worked quite OK for the Medium, but then it didn't work at all for the Hard tyres. So this is something that we need to understand and analyse. Nothing, because Monaco is again completely different. But you can see, of course, it's clearly very close now. I think I had a bit more pace on the Medium, but then I didn't have that pace on the Hard. And at the end of the day, we basically came over the line like we almost started the race. It was incredibly close and Monaco is always very hectic. You need to really nail all of qualifying to get a lap together there, get the tyres to work as well when it matters, it’s always very tricky. Monaco is very special, I would say, in that sense. Well, not in a day. And definitely not also a virtual. But yeah, that's great. I mean, we prepared a lot for it also. So of course, I'm very happy with that result as well. Well, I mean, evening stints. Not in the night. In the night, I had to sleep. Yeah, I mean, they updated me, of course, with the track limits, to just be a bit more careful from that point onwards. But the problem was also, I guess, in the beginning, I was understeering a lot on the Medium, and that was pushing me a bit off sometimes if I missed the apex. So after that, on the Hard tyres also, just leaving a bit more margin. Of course, the last few laps when Lando was catching me it was a bit harder because I had to naturally really use the track as much as I could. But we stayed within the lines, but definitely, it does require then a bit more focus, of course. Every exit, you have to be really sure what you're doing. Yeah, I just couldn't really get the tyres to work. It just felt like they were not operating in the right temperature window. And that just got worse and worse. So the last 15 laps for me was really like driving on ice. They were not responding anymore. So that's something that we have to analyse. I would say definitely this year in terms of how we managed to just, you know, turn things around. I mean, in general this year, of course, we had a really good car so far. But, yeah, for whatever reason, we didn't get on top of things from the start. I do think, of course, from yesterday qualifying onwards, it all looked a bit more normal. But maybe we were not on top of things for the race still, because on the Hard tyres, for sure, something was not optimized, because I just never felt like the tyres were working on our car. So that's something that we have to analyse. But clearly the teams around us, you know, they are catching up and they're doing a really good job. So we also need to try and find improvements, you know, from our side. I'm just broken from the bumps, to be honest. My back, everything is hurting. It's not so much from the physical side of things, but just it was so bumpy out there. Already after like 20 laps, I could really feel my back. So I'm just looking forward to laying in bed. Maybe take some painkillers. And a massage, I don't know. . You know we had the 24 hours of Spa. He's retired. It’s like ‘I've done that’. I’m not an old man. I did watch the fight as well.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah. It hurts me to say but one or two more laps and I think I would have had him. Tough, A shame. I fought hard right until the very last lap. We just lost out a little bit too much to Max in the beginning.  He was he was much better in the first stint and obviously in the second stint we were stronger, but yeah, just was a tough first half and a much better second half. One or two more laps would have been beautiful, but just not today. Yeah, I mean all weekend, yes. I think we're at a point now where we can happily say we're in the position of Ferrari and Red Bull. So yeah, it's what we have to get used to. But the team are doing a good job. I think we're all doing a very good job. So it's business as usual. It's focusing on doing the same things, it's just we’re fighting for first or second now. So yeah, it's still a surprise to say that it's frustrating not to win. But after last weekend and the improvements we made it’s what we should start to expect. I was just praying for one more lap. I was just praying for someone to say one more lap. I don't know why. But yeah, I mean, I just did everything I could. I was pushing like hell to get there and catch up and have a chance. But as soon as you get within two seconds, you start to lose downforce and grip. The tyres start to overheat again. I kind of struggled for a couple laps, but once I understood how I had to drive again, like the last lap I managed to get there, and seven tenths, like one more lap, at least he would have had to defend into Turn 1, and maybe something could have come from that, but one lap too late. It's a shame, but it is what it is, and we just struggled too much in the beginning of the race. Yeah, I would probably take out like four holes of front wing and do the same again. Like Max said, once the tyres are where they are, you can't actually do a lot. So, I mean, we were expecting it to be a little bit colder today than what it was. So we kind of set up the car more for colder conditions rather than hot. And I think I paid the price in general. So that's why I had to do so much of an introduction to the tyres and kind of bring them up so gently and look after them. Because if I didn't, I just would have fallen off a cliff like the others did. So my only chance was to drive my race. And that meant being under pressure from Charles for more laps than I would have liked. But as soon as I kind of cleared the traffic and got back into my own rhythm, then I felt good with the car. The tyres kind of came back to me and I could push and I was happy. So from then on, the pace was amazing. And so it's a good sign. It's always a good thing to have is good race pace. But clearly when it's hotter and there's more degradation to the rear tyres, we start to struggle a lot more. And this is something we know. And maybe we could have prepared for a little bit more. But nevertheless, I'm happy with the outcome. Yeah, nothing. It's such a different circuit, so not a lot, really. I mean, for the team, it's very good. It gives them a good amount of confidence. We're on the right track. We're fighting against Ferraris and Red Bulls and that's the expectation now. This is where we are and this is what we have to do. So if we were anything worse than second today, I think we didn't do a good job and we would have been disappointed. So, yeah, I think we want to do the same again, but it's such a different track. We kind of need to say how we are on Friday and ask me again then. Maybe the fifth or sixth now. It's close. Like, I don't know what I'm going to say. It depends on your driving. Honestly, I think we're all very close. In quali, maybe you would have put us a bit ahead of them yesterday. You know, without Max's slipstream, we would have been ahead. And without Oscar's penalty, like, we would have had a 1-2 on the grid for today. So probably in quali, you had the best car today. I think... It's more down to driving than car. You know, I think if you push a bit too much, you deg off. If you go too slow, you're too slow. It's all about the driver judging it and driving to the correct limit. I don't think you can just say this car was quicker, this car was slower today. So I think it's tight enough. And when you're split by one-tenth in qualifying, you can't really say this guy was way better than the other one, you know. So hopefully it continues like that because it's exciting, it's tough, and it's... Yeah, it gets you excited every weekend, so I'm looking forward to the next few. Yeah, I mean, we have a couple changes for Monaco, like I'm sure everyone does, and you set up the car completely differently to what you would set up the car here. I don't think it correlates exactly the same. I think when we can just set the car up for slow speed, we're better. But when you have to set it up for high-speed, medium-speed, and slow-speed, that's when we make the most of our strengths, which is high and medium, and we take the hit in slow-speed. But, yeah, we have some little things, and even the upgrade we had last weekend helped us a little bit move in the right direction. My worst corner on track today was Turn 14, 15, the slowest part of the circuit. And that's where I was losing most of my time still. So we still have that as a weakness. And we know that. We're working on it. And it doesn't make me too concerned for Monaco because it's a track where you want a good car, but you also just need to commit to everything. It's such a fast circuit. It's not like you kind of just turn the wheel slowly. You have to commit. You have to judge how close you're going to get to the apexes and that kind of thing. So there's a big element of risk. And when that comes into play, it kind of spreads out things a little bit too. So, yeah, I'm not concerned. I'm excited to go to Monaco. I'm sure everyone is, because it's so cool. At least excited for Saturday. And yeah, can't wait. No, I mean, I would hope so. There's no reason after a couple tracks you would want to deny it. We also had a second in China, so we've had second, first, second, you know, and I think that's good signs, but for the same case, I make a one-tenth mistake yesterday and I'm like three positions back. We probably don't have a McLaren driver on the podium or whatever, so then all of a sudden you're like, oh, it's not as good as it looks. But I think we're extracting everything we can out of the car, and when we do that, we're here. But we're on the right track. The team has done such a good job for us to be standing here. Many people didn't expect us to still be able to improve so much and to catch up with Red Bull. I don't think we're at their level just yet. As we saw today, they still have areas where they're better and maybe some areas where we are better now, which is a good sign. But yeah, I think there's going to be tracks where we can be stronger. I'm still looking forward to a couple of those tracks, but there's going to be somewhere a little bit off still. So we're working on those places and if we work and improve on them as much as we have the rest of the car, then I'm excited that we can definitely continue to fight them in more races. Honestly, I don't know. I asked them pretty early on. Because as soon as I went on the Hard tyre, I didn't feel great. And I was slow on the Medium relative to Max. And I wasn't comfortable as soon as I came out on the Hard tyre. So I quite quickly asked, like, ‘where am I struggling?’ And they're like, ‘oh, they're just pushing more than you’. But I was asking because I just felt slow and I didn't feel like I could push a lot more. So as soon as I started to push, I felt like I, you know, I'd oversteer, I'd understeer, lock tyres. It was just the tyres were not in a good window. And I think it's clear, you know, with Max saying a similar thing, that as soon as they're not in the right window, just you can't push. You don't have the confidence with the car. So I had to just manage things as best I could. And when I say I'm pushing, it doesn't mean you're 110%. Pushing can still be 90%. You're just pushing to the limit of what you want to do. But I basically changed all my switches on the steering wheel to try and help the rear tyres and try to kill the fronts, because I just had too much front at that point. And maybe five, 10 laps later, things started to come back to me. So making all these changes and changing the differential and the brake balance and all of those things really allowed me to kind of bring the tyres back into a good window. As soon as I got there, I felt confident enough to push. And as soon as I felt like I could push, it kind of spiralled in the right direction. Just more coincidence that it was that timing more than anything. But when Charles was behind me, I didn't have a lot more than what I had. And if I did, I probably would have made a mistake and went off track. So yeah, it was tricky. But as soon as Charles made the mistake, it gave me a bit of breathing room. I was like, ‘OK, maybe now I can try to push it a little bit more’. And it started to come back to me. It's tough. It's so tricky on this kind of circuit. you have a couple laps where you don't oversteer and things feel better but then you oversteer and then things feel worse, so you can feel very quickly up and down. It's just so sensitive with the tyres and that kind of stuff. I think we have a good understanding of it, it's just today we probably didn't do the best job especially in the first half of the race. We won races together already. I've done my bit! I mean, I've just never tried. I don't have a simulator in my motorhome. I mean, I still, I definitely don't do it as much as what I used to. More because I kind of play golf. Max hates golf. Like, that's... Yeah. Well, same. But, yeah, I've just never tried. I wouldn't be, like, I'd be up for it. I stayed up and watched the fight last night. So, I never sleep much anyway. I'll just go with the shadow boxing. I don't think it would have had the biggest toll. Otherwise, he probably wouldn't have done it. Yeah, so he didn't drive too late. He did a couple of stints. And he prepared for it and that kind of thing. But at least it's not a physical thing. It's more just mentally it can hurt you a bit. But I probably stayed up later than he did. What time do you sleep? Oh you did! So, I mean, I went to bed, like, I don't know what it was, 2am or something. I didn't get my 10 or 8 hours or whatever it is, and I was watching the golf, so I had a lot, and Indianapolis, so I was doing my bit, but... Yeah, I had like four screens going on. I’ve got a full set-up, just not a sim set-up. No, I respect it. It's obviously something I grew up doing so much of. I think I paid the price of doing so much of it and not many other things when I grew up. My life was literally racing, sim racing, and then school when I had to go. And I didn't do anything else. I never went out. I didn't do any of this when I was a kid. I never went out with my friends and that kind of stuff. I was a bit of a loner. Now I'm just kind of making up for my lost time, that I get to go outside and I'm kind of doing other things and enjoying that more than the sim stuff. And maybe if I did less sim stuff and more other things, maybe I would still be doing my sim racing. I think just kind of how I grew up and stuff has led me away from it a little bit more than maybe what Max has done, and maybe Max did a bit the opposite. I still love it. I still enjoy it. I still play online and do stuff with my mates online. I still enjoy it, but not something I thought of doing on a Saturday night.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, at least it's a podium. Of course I'm only very happy when I win. And today we didn't quite make it. We were very fast at the beginning of the stint with the Hard. I started to push to try and put some pressure on Lando but later on they were they were incredibly quick. But all in all, I think the race pace today was quite strong. We lacked yesterday in qualifying. After looking, we missed on the first straight especially, which we will look into. On the rest of the lap we were quick so it's looking good for the for the rest of the season. But yeah, it's incredible anyway to be on the podium with all the tifosi here in Imola. Yeah, Monaco is going to be a very special of course, as special as here in Imola. Obviously there's a lot of reds and yeah, it's always amazing to see that. I mean, it's always very special to be on the podium here in Imola. However, obviously, I'm never satisfied with a P3. You always want to be on the top step of the podium. But considering everything, I think we have lost mostly what could have been yesterday in qualifying. And this we will analyse. But today in the race, as Lando said, I think we were all very, very close. And it was all about who was pushing when exactly in the race. And then the podium was very special, as it always is when we are in Italy. I think, first of all, it's not the best track to judge upgrades, mostly because kerb riding is such a thing here that if you have a good car on kerbs, then that could hide a bit more what is the real order. The good thing is that everything we expected from those upgrades, we had it. In terms of data, it did exactly what it was supposed to do, which is always a good thing. And then looking back at yesterday, re-analysing qualifying, I think we basically lost everything at the launch. For some reason, we had a slightly different power strategy compared to McLaren and Red Bull, and we lost everything on the run down to Turn 2. Max, on top of that, had the slipstream. But this is something we'll have to look into, because especially on a track like this, track position is absolutely everything. And when you only have a tenth in between Red Bull, McLaren, and ourselves, we need to do everything perfect. And the third place today cost us maybe a better result in the race. He has done very well. I mean, it's always very tricky whenever you change, especially in the middle of the season, like it was the case here. So there was lots of new things that he had to get up to speed to. I also had Johannes, who was my performance engineer, who was new on track. So I had two persons in my team that were new in their role and that was quite difficult at the beginning, but actually they've done an incredible job and it went really well. Now we'll work on that and try to get better, but it's a really good start. No, to be honest my pace was quite similar for the whole stint. It's more Lando that then gained quite a bit of pace, and it was not possible for me to come back within DRS. Then I was in a very awkward gap to Lando where you don't get the benefits of the DRS, but you are just losing in corners, which at the beginning of the stint with the Hard, with our pace advantage, I could get within DRS. But then as soon as I lost it, It was also at the same time Lando started to push a bit more. And the two things put together made me go back a little bit. But I also had to try something a little bit different. I knew that by managing the tyres and attacking Lando at the end it was not the right thing because the pace advantage was not enough. So I just tried at the beginning to put him under a bit more pressure. But yeah, it wasn't enough. Monaco is very special for me. True that it hasn't been the most successful race for me until now. However, the pace was always there and that gives me the confidence that it will be the case this year too. However, Monaco is so specific that we need to start a little bit from a blank page. And yeah, free practice is super, super important to build the pace little by little. But I'm confident we'll be strong. And as I've said many times, obviously, it's the same roads that I took by bus to go to school when I was younger. Now it's in a Formula         1 car. So that makes it extra special for me. So I'm really looking forward to it. To be in Monaco, a very special track I think for every driver because it's a very challenging track and extra special for me, as it's my home race.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, really difficult weekend so far, even this morning. So I'm incredibly happy to be on pole here. I didn't expect that, but we made some final changes before qualifying. They seemed to make it feel a bit better. I could push a bit harder. And this track is unbelievable. One a qualifying lap, you know, to be on the limit here, close to the gravel… I touched the gravel in the last corner. Yeah, I'm still pumping. The adrenaline is very, very high. Yeah, it's of course a great start to the year, but also very special. It's 30 years since he passed away at this track. So, of course, very pleased to get pole here. And in a way, it's a nice memory to him. He was an incredible Formula 1 driver, especially in qualifying laps as well. So, yeah, great day for me, great day for the team. So I'm very, very happy. Thank you. Yeah, we kept on working. Even this morning it was not good. We just kept on trying to improve the balance of the car because it was shifting a bit all over the place yesterday and this morning. So yeah, I mean, I honestly went into qualifying and I was like ‘well, if we can get a top five, I would be happy’ because this weekend has been really difficult. There was really no reference going into qualifying. But yeah, it felt straight away a lot a little better. I felt more comfortable. I could attack corners finally a bit more and it all started to come together and it really came together in Q3. It was just following the track, to be honest. I mean Q1, Q2, Q3, just you know where there's maybe a bit more time to gain. You try to hook up the corners a bit better. Then, of course, the final lap is all out. You try to risk it all, which I think you could see in the final corner. I had a bit of a moment there, but yeah, just really trying to get everything out of it. Not at all. I mean, yesterday was terrible in long run and short run. This morning we wanted to do a long run, but then we only did like three laps. But also there it didn't feel good. But I also had no balance in the short run. So then it's quite normal that in the long run it's not good. So naturally, I think with the balance that I had in qualifying, it will be better. But I have no clue against McLaren. They looked very strong yesterday in their long run. So hopefully, yeah, we can do something similar. Yeah, for sure. I mean, the whole weekend we have been on the back foot. We managed to be on top in qualifying, but that's qualifying. You know, the race can be again a bit different. And normally I would like to be a little bit better prepared with a bit more information going into the race. So I guess, yeah, we'll have to wait and see what happens in the race. That's why I stopped talking. Well, I mean, the race is already on, that one, as well. So, yeah, a few more things to do after this, of course, and then I'll try to head back and do my stints before I arrive to the track here tomorrow. Not too late, no. I mean, I need a good sleep for sure. A tough one. I mean, it's almost impossible to overtake here, especially when the gaps are so small. Yeah, I mean, you always try and take advantage of other people's mistakes and struggles. As bad as it sounds, you try and take advantage of those times. I don't know, Max hasn't had the smoothest weekend, but I think if anyone doubted Red Bull or him coming back and doing a good job in qualifying, they're a bit stupid. So, yeah, I think we expected them to be back on track. Annoying to miss out to him once again in qualifying. But we're close and I think we're happy as a team with how we've all performed. So if we can continue and have a strong race pace tomorrow like we had yesterday and like we had in Miami, then I think we can all look forward to a good race. Yeah, we tried a lot of things, of course, quite different to what we had yesterday. But then even this morning, it was not really feeling that great because the balance shifted the other way. So yeah, just really getting into things, trying to optimise a few things here and there. But yeah, it was just a lot more difficult than we expected it to be for whatever reason. But at the end, yeah, everyone just stuck together. You know, they kept on thinking about what we could do, also back at the factory and we got there in the end. So I think that is definitely just a great feeling when you you're experiencing like a really difficult weekend to then still get it right in qualifying. Of course I hope that it doesn't happen too often but at the moment just very pleased that we we managed to to turn it around. I think the upgrades are the upgrades, and I think they do the job, but we had other issues than just the upgrades of the car. Of course, we have a lot of people looking at that, but at the same time, we also have a lot of people working on the balance issues that we had throughout the weekend. Anyway, I think all the time when you bring new parts to the car, it's not that you learn everything in a weekend. It takes time, race after race, every track. Also, you need a bit of a different set-up, so it requires different things from the car. I think in the last couple of years, this has definitely been one of the best, I would say. It's been a while that I've felt like we've been that far off. I mean, Singapore [2023] we were off the whole weekend, so that was just a terrible weekend. But here we were also quite far off and then we managed to turn it around. So it must be at least five, six years, because I don't really remember being able to turn it around like that. No, actually, I thought from the start of the year it was actually easier compared to last year. I think the struggles that I had maybe in some previous races were not as big as what we had here. It was more about fine-tuning a few little things. Now we were just completely out of the window, from my feeling, to really push. So it just required a bit more attention to detail to try and fine-tune that. But yeah, I still think it's a very strong car that I feel comfortable with. Just somehow this weekend it has been very difficult to set it up. But yeah, hopefully we learned a lot from it when we get to the next race. I mean, it's always a tricky one, Monaco, you know, to get everything out of the car because so many things can happen. But yeah, hopefully it's a bit more consistent, let's say like that. Yeah, I mean, honestly, I think it's great. You know, you get punished if you go wide. And like Oscar said, you know, you don't need to look: is my tyre in the white line or not, because of the changes that we made with the FIA, you know, to paint wider lines. And honestly, it's just a fantastic track. I wish we had 24 of those on the calendar. You know, we go to a lot of tracks. that don’t really excite me. But this is unbelievable. You know, in a qualifying lap, this is how it should be, you know. There are a few old-school tracks that we have remaining on the calendar and they are always very exciting. And that's also what I fell in love with when I started racing and watching F1. So yeah, we need more of those. I mean, I would rather qualify eight tenths ahead, but that's not possible. It is very enjoyable when you have a turnaround like we had. So yeah, I was really excited in qualifying and really happy when I heard that we were on pole. So I guess by that, yeah, it was great that it was that close and that we really, really had to fight for it. But I still come back to the first point. I would rather qualify with a lot in front! But I mean, that's how it goes, right? I guess sometimes, you know, you have weekends where everything really comes together and then the car becomes like unbelievable to drive. And it doesn't matter what you do, it just feels fantastic, and then you can do some really like special laps, which have happened in the past. But this was also really cool. Yeah, we were tow buddies out there in Q2 already, Q3. So I gave him a tow to 17, then he gave me a tow to Turn 2. I think I did arrive a bit too quick for my liking because I did miss Turn 2 a little bit. So I did gain, then I did lose a bit in 2. Overall, I think it did help me a little bit. But when you are struggling the whole weekend and then finally it's coming around, you have to look for these little advantages to try and stay ahead. And it worked out beautifully. Honestly, it's been great. And actually, I had a funny story in qualifying where we were driving in the pits… A lot of people were clapping. Then one guy, he was doing some different things to me, so I gave him the finger. And then the next time I came around, he was clapping. So, you know, they learn. You know, it's easy to be not nice to drivers, but I can also be not nice to you, you know! So, luckily he was a bit higher up. But it's good. After that, I guess he appreciated it. But, you know, the fans in general here are very passionate. They love motorsport. Of course, naturally, there's more support for Ferrari here, but that's absolutely fine. You know, they have a massive fan base. And, yeah, Italy loves motorsport. Go-karting as well, you know, when we grew up. I mean, it's really fantastic.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, pretty good. A little bit of a scruffy last corner, but I think around here it's so, so difficult to do a perfect lap, so I'm really happy. I've been really comfortable with the car from the moment we put it on track yesterday, and so, so close to pole, but very happy. It's been a little while since I've been back up here, so I'm very happy with how this weekend's going so far. I think yes. I think normally in the past we say no, but yeah, I think with our recent performances, we've learned to say yes. So we'll see what we can do.  I think, you know, we've definitely been on the pace all weekend. You know, you can never count out Max and Red Bull, of course, like we've just seen. But I don't know. I think the confidence is high. Of course, it's not the easiest track to overtake on, but yeah, I think the confidence is high that we can do something good. Thank you. Yeah, I mean I've been happy with it all weekend to be honest. From the start of P1 all the way through quali I think a couple of scruffy laps in the middle of qualifying but in Q3 it came together a bit more and I was happy with the last lap. So yeah, it's been a really strong weekend for us so far. There's been no points yet of course, they are tomorrow, but yeah I think we've been pretty happy all weekend. It's a better feeling, of course, and having parts that you know are going to make the car faster on the car is always a confidence boost. It doesn't change the world in terms of how we drive, but yeah, anytime the engineers tell you they're going to make the car faster, it's always a nice little boost. So yeah, it's been feeling good and nothing unexpected, which is always good. It's really, really tough. I think, to be honest, one of the toughest tracks of the year in terms of how old school it is and having gravel everywhere. I think as drivers, these are the kind of tracks that we really enjoy. You don't have to worry about track limits, or at least we didn't today. Yesterday we did. But you don't have to worry about that. You know if you've gone over it because you're in the gravel or you're off. So it's a really exciting lap around here and a lot of fast corners, a lot of corners in general, we don't get much time to rest. So it's been a fun weekend. Yeah, I mean, I need to see it back a bit more. When I looked in the mirrors, I didn't see any cars coming. And yeah, then he was right there. So we need to have a look and see what the stewards say. Yeah, I think more or less the same thing. I think our long runs yesterday looked good, but it's very, very close. I think that's kind of been the story of the season and the last few races, everyone's been so tight. So yeah, we'll see. Overtaking is very tough here, but I think we can be optimistic. Yeah, I mean, if you can get into the lead, that usually helps out a bit early on. So, yeah, I mean, of course, you try to get a good start, but yeah, we'll see. I think in terms of qualifying sessions in F1, I think, to be honest, it's been a strong weekend the whole time. I feel like it's been a good qualifying session for me, I would say, you know, up there. Probably not the single best but certainly up there in the sessions I've had, and I feel like you know the last couple of weekends… Like, Miami was a good qualifying day and I feel like today's been strong as well. So it's been nice to build a bit more consistency which is something I've been trying to work on. so I'm happy with my day's work. I mean, yes, it makes it a bit more difficult because the risk is more, but I mean, we have track limits everywhere we go. So there's always the risk, even if the risk is a bit different. One is you end up in the gravel, completely ruin the lap or the car. And the other is you go a bit wide, but you ruin your lap as well. It's a bit of a different risk. I think here, with some of the white line changes we made last night with the FIA, you know, we don't have to worry about whether we're in the track or out of the track. We know exactly if we're in or out. And I think for us, that's the more satisfying thing and easier for us. So, I think that was a good change overnight. But yeah, definitely of course the consequence here is a little bit higher than some places, I would say. You know, you bottom out and it's yeah… I know I said the consequences are more or less the same just before but If I was in the wall, I don't think I would say the same thing. So I think for us it’s a welcome thing. and I think China was a very similar example. They added more gravel back in there and we were very complimentary of that work. So I think we would welcome it at other tracks as well. You saw him too? Yeah, I saw the same guy, I think. He wasn't giving me the finger, but he was giving me the thumbs down. But he was clapping for you. Wow. Did you sign with Ferrari or something? Is there something we don't know? I don't know. I mean, it's cool. I think in all sports, a little bit of giving the opposition some stick is always good fun, I think, and part of sport. Of course, there's always a limit to that. But I think this is what sport can be about. Sometimes, you know, you look at all the football rivalries and stuff like this, there's always so much passion on both sides. And I think the Ferrari fans are, you know, the epitome of passionate fans. They've been very welcoming this weekend. Maybe not from a distance in the pit lane, but you know, they've been very passionate. And you know, these are the kind of fans that that we love in F1. For me, coming here, it's my first time racing here and it's been very special but always Monza, even though it's not my favourite track on the calendar, it's one of my favourite weekends because of the fans. And none of them are cheering for me, they're all cheering for Ferrari. So I think, for me, being part of events like that is always very special. and Yeah, credit to the Italian fans.
LN: Yeah, I saw the same guy, but I think he was on my side. To be honest, the Italian fans have always been extremely kind to me and very supportive. Yeah, so I've always loved coming to... I mean, Monza is, let's say, the Italian race that I think everyone loves the most. But yeah, all of them. There's a lot of fans that have always supported me since go-karts. That's where most of the races are in Italy when you're that young. So we spend a lot of time here. But they've always been very supportive. So I thank the fan that was up there and all of them… I mean of course I’m not in Ferrari, and a lot of them want me to go to Ferrari, but yeah, they've always been very passionate and great fans to me, so I thank them for that.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Thanks. Yeah, great. I mean, P3 is not a bad job at all, and yeah, within a tenth, both of us for P1. So, tiny, tiny margins, but I think for us as a team, we've had a very good day, a very good weekend so far. Oscar's done a great job, and so did Max, so it’s exciting. We're close, and I can't wait for tomorrow. Yes, we still need to get used to it, but we're getting closer. To be ahead of Ferrari is also a nice result for us. But it's going to be close. It's going to be a good race tomorrow. Hopefully it's an exciting one to watch, also an exciting one inside the car. But tough, especially when the lap times are so tight. A lot of it is down to Turn 1, lap one, the strategy, the pit stops. So it's going to be a tough race. Car's been great all weekend, to be honest. I think since FP1 we've been feeling pretty good. Frustrating, I mean, anytime you're within one tenth of pole, you always feel like, where was that last little bit? And I think it was definitely in there, but it's a difficult track just to nail. And I think I did a good job. I was happy with my laps. So I think both Oscar and Max did a very good job today. But it's such a quick and difficult circuit. You kind of have to commit. You can't try and do things. You have to just commit to it and kind of see how you end up on the other side. So it's all about timing. And as soon as you misjudge something a little bit, it can go wrong pretty quickly. So it's an exciting quali lap. I think we did a good job from a team side. I feel like I did a good job today. So strong performance from McLaren and excited for tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, we were very good yesterday, but also in Imola when you see others, we didn't do the quickest laps in these long runs. We were probably the most consistent, but a lot of others had traffic and things like that. So it's close, like it was today. We were confident, you know, the car felt good. It was also a bit colder, so maybe if that kind of came back to us, that would be nice. Yeah, we had a good day yesterday. The whole weekend, the car has been performing well and the team have been doing a good job. But I don't expect us just to have like an easy day tomorrow. I think to overtake here is pretty much impossible, like I said. So that's our first task. But at the same time, if we can pressure them and kind of keep on their toes throughout the whole race and have a performance like Miami, then I think we can be optimistic, of course. But just the overtaking and the strategy is probably a bit harder than what was in Miami. Honestly, I don't know just yet. That's what tonight's for. So I haven’t really thought much about the race and what to plan for. In terms of tyres, I think myself and Red Bull are similar with what tyres we have available for tomorrow. I think some other teams have different tyre choices. But yeah, tonight, after all of these interviews and stuff, we kind of get to work and discuss our plans for tomorrow. But at the minute, I have no idea. I feel like we're just returning back to how it was six years, seven years ago. I don't know why. They made them tarmac. They said it was impossible that we'd ever go back, and now we're just going back to kind of how it was. But like Max said, just the fact we don't have to think about white lines. When you're trying to drive and you're trying to look where the white line is relative to your tyre and kind of guess, it's just something we shouldn't have to think about. So it's more down to the driver just taking the risk and kind of committing to corners, especially on a track like this. We have to commit so much. It's kind of that risk/reward, which you have. And on all the tracks, it's easy for everyone just to find the limit, go over the limit, and then slowly build back to it. Less challenging, you know? So I think what would be even more exciting was, as much as I'm not the biggest fan, is like a Sprint race, you know, one FP1. Like this, it’s a bigger challenge for everyone and the drivers to find the limit without making too big mistakes. So yeah, I think hopefully the direction we can go in for more of the tracks. But Imola is always a special track, so we're always going to be better here.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Oh wow. About time, huh? F***, sorry. What a race, huh? Yeah, it's been a long time coming, but finally I've managed to do it, so I'm so happy for my whole team. I finally delivered for them. And, yeah, long day, tough race, but finally on top, so I'm over the moon. I am. I mean, the whole weekend's been good. I've just had some little setbacks along the way, but I knew on Friday we had the pace, and just a couple of mistakes here and there, but today we managed to put it together. We put the perfect strategy, it all paid off, so thanks to McLaren, everyone, and I have to give a shout-out to my mum and dad, of course. What do I say to them? I'm just proud, really. I mean, a lot of people, I guess, doubted me along the way. I've made a lot of mistakes over my last five years, my short career, but today we put it all together, so this is all for the team. I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them, and I did believe in them, and today proved exactly that. It is indeed. Thank you so much, mate. It felt incredible. I mean, it's a good crowd as well. The whole team are there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what I’m meant to say, honestly, but just a lot of smiling, a lot of cheers. A lot of hard work goes into a day like today. But just happiness, me smiling, which is not always the case. But yeah, I mean, I dream of these days sometimes and you never know when they're going to come towards you. But today was that day. So as much as my mind was going crazy and I was thinking a lot of things, I was also just quiet, you know. It was just a bit lonely out there at times and it's just nice to kind of reflect on everything you've done to get to that point. As much as I want to say no, it's a yes. To get that first victory is always incredible. And I've, of course, had my moments where we've been close, and I've never been able to convert it into the win. But I wasn't worried. As much as a lot of people doubted that I was going to be able to put it together and win a race, I wasn't worried. I've kind of been more confident than ever this year that I've got what it takes and the team have got what it takes and I was patient with it. I've just been doing my job and executing my races, executing my qualis, and doing what I can do best. And I knew my time was coming. I said it this morning. It's not often that I'm optimistic about things. But actually, all weekend, there's been something, you know? Like, already practice, qualis. We've been close. And we were very good on Friday. And there was kind of that spark. And we maybe lost it a little bit into Saturday. But today, it definitely came back and turned into a little fire. So yeah, it was an incredible race. No. It was put out very quickly! I kind of had a little flashback to yesterday's Sprint race when I saw Sergio on the inside. I just thought, ‘OK, let's try to make it around Turn 1 for once’. So I took it easy. I knew we had good pace, and I knew was in it for the long game. I was behind Checo the whole of the first stint, but my pace at the end of the first stint was the best on track. And I could still see Max. And when you can see Max, there's hope. And it's not often that you can see Max on track. So I knew the whole time, even when I was back in sixth, that there could be opportunities, whether there was one Safety Car or something went my way. I was very quick at the end of the first stint. I kept my head down. We kept pushing. Everyone boxed from ahead of me, and I could just use all the pace that I had, which was a lot of it. And being able to go so long on the tyres, being able to have the pace I had, turned into that bit of luck, which I'll happily admit. Sometimes you've got to have a bit of luck on your side, and things have got to go your way, and I had that today. I'll take it happily. and yeah after the Safety Car I could kind of just get my head down and push on and I was confident I could take it from there. I mean, I said at the beginning of the year we could win races. A lot of people doubted what I could say and the fact that I said that. I think they doubted that McLaren could win races. They doubted that I could win races. But I was confident. Deep down I knew that we had our time coming. So the team have done an amazing job. We weren't even into Q2 here last year. So now the fact we're on top, we've won a race, the team have done an insane job to kind of go from where we were to where we are now. And we've chipped away, especially the last couple of months. There's been a lot of hard work. And whenever you bring an upgrade, it's not easy to kind of just go out and execute and just show that it's better. But little things come together and when you have all these little bits coming together, it turns into a perfect day like it did today. So, of course, I have to say a big thanks to all of McLaren, everyone back in the factory, everyone that's here, because I doubt… It would have been a lot less likely that I won today without these upgrades and without the hard work that they've been putting into everything. So, I would like to say it's the start. And now I'm already hungry for more. But, yeah, we'll keep our heads down. We'll keep pushing and I'm sure we can be here a lot more often. I mean, I was meant to fly, but Zak just told me we fly tomorrow. I'm not going to sleep. I'm going all the way. I might have more than just a scratch on my nose tomorrow, so I don't care. But I'll enjoy my time. This only happens once when you're taking your first win. It's nice to do it here in Miami. I was kind of hoping it was going to be at Silverstone, but I'll try to do it there as well. True. So tonight's going to be a good night. Well, I think it was a long time coming, you know, and I'm very happy to be beaten by Lando today. He definitely deserved it. He was just miles faster at the end there. So, yeah, it's great. You know, winning your first race is always, I think, quite emotional. And, yeah, it brings you back to all the days that you worked towards Formula 1, and then you dream of being on the podium, but then being on the top step. So, yeah, of course, I'm not very happy with my day, but you can appreciate and respect what Lando has done today, and I'm very happy for him. Yeah, I mean, I've not done many Safety Car restarts from the front for a good amount of years. Yeah, just a bit rusty. That was all. I'll make sure I work on it a little bit more for next time. But yeah, as long as I defended well into Turn 1 and kept the lead in Turn 1, I was quite confident I could go from there. So the pace was good enough in the first stint. Maybe didn't look it at the very beginning, just because I was stuck behind a lot of cars. But having clean air, having fresher tyres as well, I could push and I was a little bit wary that Max normally is a bit slow off the mark and then all of a sudden clicks it into gear two and he's gone. But not today. So in a good way, I could just stay focused, keep the car on track, not make any mistakes and the car felt great. But I said already on Friday, it felt good. I was confident on Friday and today that kind of feeling came back to me a lot. It was good. A lot of Sundays recently have been strong. Just today we managed to step it up and turn it into something even more. But I was pushing. I wanted to go for a fastest lap on the last lap. But I was imagining Andrea on the pit wall, like, ‘no, Lando, please’. So, yeah, he was talking to me, but I just thought then just to take it home and take it easy. But until then, you know, I wanted to pull away, and I didn't want Max in the picture when I was over the line, and I don't think he was. So that was job done. So happy with that. Russia ‘21 was a very, very different situation to today. A lot of people talk crap about Sochi and the things which went on. And yes, I potentially lost out on a victory. I did lose out on a victory. I and we. I never want to drag the team down but I didn't do the best of jobs and as a team we didn't. So that happened. And as much as people, yeah, like to continue to use that and say, even after China last weekend when I made a mistake in Turn 1 on Lewis… Yeah, I mean a lot of people doubted that I could go out and win races and perform under the pressure of leading the race, especially with Max behind you and those types of things, but really this year I felt more confident than ever. I wasn't thinking of these things. Like, probably last year would have thought of it. But this year I've been much better with just kind of keeping my mind focused and focusing on my job. I'm doing a good job. I'm fast and I'm executing things exactly how I want to do. I've improved on a lot of my weaknesses and all that hard work has paid off. So no, I wasn't thinking of that thing. So I was smiling. And I was thinking like, how am I going to celebrate? What am I going to say? I'm not very good at kind of just coming up with these things and improvising when that situation comes. So I was rehearsing my lines. But when I went over the line, I just turned into something else. I don't know what it is. It's just you're just happy. So my voice hurts a little bit. My throat hurts. Yeah, you just forget about it. You don't really care what you're thinking of. You're just looking at the track. You're focusing on that. And once you cross the line, then you just let go. Thank you. Yeah, I spoke to my mum and my dad already, which is always nice because they're the ones… Normally my dad comes to the races, but not today, so I'm sure he's regretting that just a little bit. But, yeah, I mean, my parents have been so supportive. You know, they're the ones who are with you from the start. They allowed everything to happen. They're the ones that got me into racing, supported me, and allowed me to get to Formula 1, reach my dream, and do what I've loved to do since I was a kid. And I'm very fortunate for everything that they've done and the position they've allowed me to be in. So you just have these flashbacks of every moment, you know, like... I just remember now being at a racetrack for the very first time in my life when I was five, six years old. My brother, my dad, and me just standing there and watching and just seeing the cars go by, to today, like being on top of the podium. So you think of those moments, and therefore, of course, I want to speak to my mum and dad, first of all, because you shared all those moments with them. And I just say a big thanks. And for my grandma, because she's not been so well lately. I saw her last week, and I told her that I was going to win a race. I didn't say when. I just said I was going to win a race. And I didn't think it would be coming this soon. So I'm just very happy that I was able to do it as quickly as I did. Yep. There was one, one opportunity, and this was Qatar last year. To win the main race was maybe a bit more of an ask. I think Max, I don't know what Max’s gap to Oscar and I was like five seconds, six seconds, I think. So you can't go against that and put that ever away. But as a Sprint race, the Sprint race was the loss. I don't know if there was a main race that I've missed out on, to be honest. And that's obviously the more valuable one, the one that means a lot more to you. So I kind of want to say no. I kind of want to say I don't think there was a Sunday where I've thrown stuff away. I've thrown away maybe a podium or a P2, but I think every opportunity where I've been there to try and take a win, I've been there. There's a couple of times when I've been blocked to those opportunities. One was Singapore last year, and Carlos took it. And another one was Australia this year, where the two Ferraris were ahead. Apart from that, there wasn't a Sunday. And as much as people want to say there was this and that and, yeah, Russia and whatever it was, Qatar, there wasn't a Sunday. I've missed out on a win because of something I've done wrong. There were pole positions. There was a Sprint race win. But nothing more than that. And I think that's why I never lost faith. I never didn't believe in what I could go out and do. So happy to put that to bed and prove a lot of these people wrong because, yeah. As much as I love to see it and I go on Instagram and I like all the comments of people abusing me, I freaking love it. It makes me smile more than anything, especially Lando No-wins. That's become the thing. And yeah, for me to finally prove those people wrong and prove to people that didn't think I could go out and do it, it's put an even bigger smile on my face today. So I thank all of them. Point two? It would have been tough. I would have had to overtake two Ferraris, a Red Bull, Oscar. Oscar was doing a very good job, so hats off to him… Yeah. I had to push fairly hard just for a lap. And then I could kind of relax a little bit. I had fresher tyres, my pace was very good in clean air and Max was for the first time all race not in clean air, so I had the advantage and I could control things fairly well. I pushed for the first bit, my engineer was giving me updates on the gap and I felt like I was cruising and extending the gap and I didn't feel like I had to do anything more. I don't know, I'm shivering like hell, because I wanted to keep all my champagne on me and now I'm freaking cold. So yeah, I didn't have to push too much for the first lap or two and then I could kind of cruise and be fairly comfortable. I was still pushing, because I wanted to open the gap, like I said. And, of course, your mind wanders a bit. My mind does. Maybe not everyone's does. But, yeah, you know, walls get close sometimes, and you have those little moments where you think, ‘OK, don't screw it up’. But I also was improving my laps and kind of getting quicker and quicker every lap, so I had a lap time to focus on. And, like, I wanted to go to kind of getting those fastest laps in. I don't know if I did or not, but I had something to focus on and that took my mind away from thinking of the wrong things and therefore was all okay. Yeah. I'll start with that. I think there's always one thing I try to keep. And as much as I... Sometimes I think everyone maybe doesn't talk the best of other people because of certain situations. You're under pressure. You're racing people. People crash into you. You get frustrated. And of course, you're going to say things, things that people don't like, things that others do. One thing I've always had and I will always have is respect for the people I race against, as much as, yeah, sometimes things make you not want to have it. I've always had respect for everyone I race against, from the top to the bottom of every category that I've gone through since karting, I've always had respect for my competitors and the people I raced against. And I've always said that. So as much as when you put the helmet on, you hate them, and you want to beat them, and you don't care who's who, I've always had respect for the people I've raced against. So when anyone comes up [to me], especially people who have achieved a lot, because it always means a little bit more. So when Lewis, Fernando, Max, Charles, Carlos, whenever they come up to you or people have good words for you, I appreciate those things a lot. Because from these people, it means something. Maybe from others, it doesn't. And yeah, from these people, they're the people who know what it takes to achieve these types of things for the work, the time, the effort that goes into doing something like this. So, yeah, I guess thanks to them and thanks to everyone who supports me and has that kind of similar respect that I do for them back. I appreciate those types of things. The other point was my lines. Yeah, so... I mean, you're always going to have people that don't support you and people that do. When you're out there on the podium and I do my in lap, there's a lot of people out there cheering you on and waving and congratulating. So I thank all of them. Of course, the people I keep closest to me, my team, my engineers, my manager, my trainer, my family, those are the people whose words you always take. as something more meaningful. And anyone can say what they want. I'm always for that. People don't need to like me. They don't need to support me. I'm not always asking for those types of things. But yeah, when people doubt me in certain situations, yeah you want to prove them wrong. You want to go out and prove them wrong. They think they know what they're talking about and when you prove that they don't, then that's a nice thing to go out and do. So, yeah not like a dig at anyone. I wanted to say like the Valtteri line ‘to whom it may concern’, but I was like ‘ that's copyrighted’, so I didn't want to repeat it but it's just nice to just go out there and do my job and show people what I'm capable of. Absolutely. I don't know what it's full of… Probably like some hard liquor. It will be tonight. I've always enjoyed my moments of, you know, I have my times when I'm happy with what I'm able to go out and do. I'm just one of those guys that I'm not happy when I know I've not done the job I'm capable of doing. And today shows what I'm capable of doing. I think all year I've done a very good job. And I've worked hard and I've eliminated and got rid of a lot of my weaknesses. Yeah, like I'm still going to be that guy. I don't think that's going to change. I'm still going to be glass half full because for me, that's what works for me. That's my mindset. Everyone has their own way of doing things, their own approach, their own way that they talk to themselves and think of how can I approach today? How can I go out and do the best job? For me, it's... talking down at myself and kind of putting myself down because for me that's what works and I'm fine with that like I don't need other people to be happy with it and for other people to agree with it. It's what's best for me and it's what works best is what's made me who I am and I think that's uh my best way of going forward. So I'm going to have my days when the glass is full and I can be happy and I'm proud of myself. Everyone's going to have those days and everyone should have those days. But in order to make myself the best man, the best driver, I have my way of doing things and I stick to that. Yeah. I didn't see him in the garage, to be honest. I was busy prepping for the race. But he saw me after, and he came up to congratulate me. So I guess an honour, because whenever you have someone like this, it has to be an honour for them to come up to you, to take time out of their life, to pay their respect for what you've done. He said he was my lucky charm because it's my win. So I don't know if he's going to come to more races now. But yeah, there's a lot of special people or cool people that have been here this weekend. Donald is someone that you got to have a lot of respect for in many ways. And yeah, for anyone like that who acknowledges what you can go out and do and acknowledges the work ethic that goes into things, you got to be thankful for that. And I was. So yeah, a cool moment. And that's all.",Miami,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"I mean, you win, you lose. I think we're all used to that in racing, right? But, yeah, today was just a bit tricky. I think already on the Mediums it didn't feel fantastic. We were pulling away, but not like it should be. And then once we made the pit stop, and I heard what lap times the McLarens were doing, I was like, ‘wow, that's pretty quick’. So yeah, once they then also switched on to the Hard tyre, they just had more pace. And especially Lando, he was flying. Yeah, it was incredibly difficult for us on that stint. But if a bad day is P2, I take it, right? And I'm very happy for Lando. It's been a long time coming. And it's not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it today. Yeah, I mean, understeer, oversteer, just very low grip on four wheels, and that's something that we have to understand. Yeah, I mean, they came with an upgrade. Yeah, for sure it looks like it works, right? So we have a bit of work to do from our side. I think definitely it wasn't our strongest weekend in terms of race pace, but we'll analyse it all and we'll try to come back stronger from it. It's definitely better here, mate, to go out! Well, I mean, I didn't really see him in the beginning because I was more focused on Oscar behind and the Ferraris. But then I boxed and I heard the pace that he was doing on the used Mediums. I was like, ‘I mean, that's quite insane’. I mean, I would have never been able to do so. So I knew even if there wouldn't have been a Safety Car that when he would come out on fresh tyres that I would have had to push on quite a lot to be able to keep him behind. Then actually, I mean, the Safety Car came. Yeah, I mean... It's racing. Sometimes it works for you, sometimes it works against you. And even with that Safety Car, we still had all the opportunities to win today, but we're clearly not quick enough after that Safety Car. And once I realised that, I just settled in and tried to come home in second. I was just quite poor, I would say, in the race. But also, I never really felt comfortable the whole weekend with it. I think on the Medium it was still OK-ish, but on the Hard it was quite a disaster. I mean, just low grip, just very tricky balance in the low-speed. I couldn't really lean on the rear while in the high-speed I was understeering a lot. So when you have these two issues, you cannot also balance it out because you're chasing two different things. So yeah, just driving to the grip that I had and it was not a lot. Yeah, I was very aware. I mean, I turned in and I saw him lock up. And I looked after the race. There was like a scratch on my diffuser. So something must have hit. But yeah, it was very close. Could have ended in a disaster, of course, for the team as well. So yeah, lucky. I didn't like it, so I decided to take it out and test the durability of the front wing as well. So that's a crash test done. Yeah, there was no damage. The cone was out of the way for everyone, so it was basically a free-for-all after that. It didn't feel different, so I don't know. Maybe it was already damaged. I don't know. I mean I hit that thing and then my pace was the same so I didn't really know if there was damage. I didn't even listen to point two, to be honest. What was that? I don't know what the gap was, to be honest, before the Safety Car. How far were you behind me? I mean, it's always if, if, if, right?  If my mum had balls, she would be my dad. So, yeah. I mean, it's how it goes to racing. Sometimes it works out for you, sometimes it doesn't.",Miami,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Well, it was very tricky. Obviously, Checo was on my inside. I didn't have a great start. As soon as I left the clutch, I had wheel spin. I saw Checo on the right, but there was very little grip, so he locked up. And I thought we would crash, but fortunately for everybody, we all got out that first corner without any damage. Then it was all about trying to focus on ourselves, but today we're again missing a little bit of pace. But we did our best. Obviously, we have been unlucky with the Safety Car. The timing of the Safety Car wasn't great for us. Then we ended up having the oldest tyres of all the guys at the front. But we managed everything quite well. So P3 was the best we could do, and we should be satisfied with that. Yeah, well, first of all, I'm really happy for Lando. He deserves it. Very often, he arrived very close to it, but for one reason or another, he didn't make it. But today, he did an incredible job, and the whole weekend, he has been on it. And already in Q2, I think there was a lap where I was like, ‘OK, they are very, very strong’. And we were expecting them to be strong, maybe not as strong as what they've shown today, but he fully deserves it. And now it's up to us to hopefully bring the upgrades very quickly and catch up. Yeah, it's not too bad. I'm just really happy for Lando. You know, as much as we all want to beat each other and to come out on top, it's always emotional to see so many emotions in one of your competitors. We have all grown up together. I mean, Max and myself were on the category above, but you always keep an eye on the younger categories. And I remember looking at Lando when he was in KF3, and we all had this same dream of being a Formula 1 driver one day. and then once you achieve that you want obviously the first win and I remember my first win and it is a very, very special moment. So I told him already that he needs to enjoy as much as possible but I don't have to tell him that, I'm sure that tonight will be a good night and he definitely deserves it. Well, if we compare ourselves to Max this weekend, it's been a positive weekend. However, we cannot completely ignore Lando. And Lando in SQ2, I remember he did a lap where I was like, ‘OK, they are extremely quick’. Then for some reason, and as Lando said, I think they weren't as special on Saturday for some reason. But today they were really, really strong. As I've said many times, I think the season will be up to upgrades. We have ours coming very soon and that will define a little bit the rest of the season for us. So we've got to work hard and hopefully those upgrades will be as good as theirs and will help us to do a significant step forward. It's soon.",Miami,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think my engagement wasn't good in the start. So then, of course, I had to squeeze him a bit. Luckily, everything worked out in Turn 1. Then, of course, we had the Safety Car just to calm things down a little bit. But after that, you know, steadily we could increase the gap a little bit. But it wasn't entirely perfect. So we still have a bit of work to do. At least now with the new format, we can still fine tune the car a little bit. So hopefully we can improve it a little bit for later on in qualifying, and especially for tomorrow in the race. But the win is good. I'm happy with that. And it gives us a good few points to look at as well to improve. Yeah, China felt really good. I mean, the car was really, really nice to drive. Here, it was a bit more difficult for me. So there are a few more things to improve. Yeah, I think only the start wasn't particularly great. But besides that, yeah, just looking after the tyres, not really knowing, of course, how they were going to last. Still not entirely happy with the balance of the car, so we need to look into that. Yeah, a bit too much oversteer, I would say. So we'll try to fine tune that no before qualifying, because I had the same problem yesterday in [Sprint] qualifying. So it definitely highlighted that what we have at the moment is probably not the best for quali and race. But nevertheless, we won the race, which I think is the most important. And we'll try to just make it a bit more solid. Yes, same as yesterday. I mean, hot, slippery, not much to add to it. Yeah, I mean, I think the more laps that we can do on a new set every time, of course, I think it will all settle down a bit. I think this is something that in a Sprint qualifying, when you do two mediums and suddenly one Soft tyre sometimes it feels a bit weird because the two compounds always drive a bit different. and when you only have one shot at it and you make a mistake or the car is not in the right balance window, then you can have a horrible lap, which I find a bit of a shame. That's why I prefer a bit more of a normal qualifying. You know, you have a few sets to really nail the lap and get used to the track conditions as well. So hopefully in the afternoon, it will all be a bit more normal. Yeah, we changed a few things that we thought would be better, probably going into qualifying, and it didn't work. So we'll look into what we can improve now. And yeah, I mean, of course, that's why I'm very happy with this new format, that at least you can make a few changes. Otherwise, you are stuck with it and basically it can ruin your weekend. I'm here to just race and try to win. Of course, it's important to feel good and have a stable environment. We're working on that and I'm sure that we can get that. So many things have been said. I've been literally answering these questions from March, Feb… End of Feb? I don't even know what to say anymore about it. We just tried to focus as a team on the performance of the car. So far, it hasn't impacted that, and I'm very happy for that. Yeah, I hope this is worst case scenario, let's say like that, because I didn't really feel happy with the car. So there is definitely a lot of room for improvement. And hopefully we can find that already in qualifying. But I think nonetheless in qualifying, it's always so tricky around here on this track to get the tyres to work over one lap. And even when you think that, you know, you nailed it, then you go out again with another tyre set, it's still very hard to be consistent on it. So that is going to be the trickiest part, I think, of the weekend, to try and get right again in quali. And then, yeah, if we just naturally make the balance a bit better, then our deg will be better in the race. And then normally, yeah, we should be even more competitive.",Miami,post-sprint,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah I had a quite a good start and then I was in the inside of Turn 1. Obviously I didn't want to take too many risks because we've got also qualifying later on and if you have a crash in the Sprint then you probably don't participate later on. So I tried to end it there. We both braked very very late with Max but eventually he got to keep the position and then I was pushing very hard but in the first three laps they had a bit more pace. Then we had a similar degradation, so tomorrow, it's a long race, so qualifying will be important to be starting as much in front as possible, and then hopefully we can put them under pressure with the strategy. Yeah, it was obviously very close yesterday. Not many laps in FP1, so hopefully now with the Sprint race, I got a bit more laps around this track, and I hope we can target the pole position. So that's the target. Then let's see if we manage to achieve that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, I had quite a good launch. Then I was in the inside of Max for Turn 1. We both braked, I think, very late… Too late! But we still managed to make the corner and eventually Max kept the track position. After that, it was all about… I was trying to stay within one second to get the DRS, especially after the first Safety Car, which we didn't manage to do. And then we were in a position where it was actually very difficult to come back to Max. I think we had a bit of a tyre advantage. We had the new Mediums. So it's going to be very important to try and obviously be in front in the qualifying this afternoon. OK. Obviously I don't think anybody on the grid has an optimal set-up, because with the very few laps we do in FP1 and especially for me, as I've only done one, you're always going a little bit into the unknown and anticipating also the track conditions throughout the weekend, as from the Friday to the Sunday it changes a lot. It's always very difficult but I think we did a reasonably good job. We still have to change a few things for this afternoon to make it better. And hopefully it will pay off. I think we were quite similar on that. Maybe in the last two, three laps, Max had the upper hand and he pulled away a bit more. But apart from that, I was just struggling a little bit with the dirty air. Whenever I was getting within 1.8, 1.7, I would drop to 2.2, 2.3, and then I would come back a little bit. I was mostly struggling with dirty air. I think if I had the DRS on that first lap, we probably could have put him under a bit more pressure, but we didn't. So we need to look into that tomorrow to try and make sure that we keep the DRS if we are behind and we pull away if we are behind from. No, I think it's always been the case, and I think also it's very car-dependent. I think some teams are saying that it's getting worse. For some reason, on my side, it actually feels a little bit better compared to last year to follow, but we still feel it. And especially when it's all about tyre overheating, as soon as you are behind, you have a little bit less downforce, you slide a bit more, and then the overheating is getting worse and worse. So it's not track-specific. I think it's always been like that.",Miami,post-sprint,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was really hard to get through Daniel in the beginning, and once I got through, I got through it quite quickly, but I was three seconds from Charles and given the short duration of the race, it was pretty tricky. I was like getting within two seconds, 1.8, but then it was quite hard to get a little bit closer. So anyway, let's look forward for the rest of the weekend. The fans are amazing. It's really nice to be here with all of them, and I really hope I can give them a great race of the weekend. Yeah, I think we will be able to be strong, so I definitely look forward to it. Yeah, I lost a place to Daniel at the start, basically trying to get Charles, but I think we all braked really late, and I just went deep into Turn 1. I ended up locking. So I lost the position to Daniel, nearly lost another position to Carlos, but in the end, we kept it together. And then right after the Safety Car, as soon as I could use DRS, I managed to get through Daniel. But then I was, I think, three seconds already from Charles. Given how short the race is, it was really game over. I tried at times. I was getting closer. But once I found, like, I was around 1.8 or so, it was quite hard to get a little bit closer. So, unfortunately the race was just a little bit too short. I think in these Sprint races, if you have the Safety Car, then it's really hard to really do anything else.",Miami,post-sprint,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"I think we definitely improved the car a bit, but I don't know what it is, every single year that we come here, I find it extremely difficult to be very consistent with the car feeling, the tyre feeling over one lap. It's just super hard to make sure that Sector 1 feels good and sector three at the end of the lap. To make that happen together is incredibly tough. And again, today, it was really about finding that balance. I think we did OK. I mean, it's not, let's say, the most enjoyable lap out of my career just because of how slippery it is and how, like… You're not very confident on the lap. But we are on pole, and that's, of course, the most important. It definitely feels a little bit more under control, which I was looking for. So hopefully that will help us out tomorrow, but we'll find out. Yeah, I think we know what we did wrong, what I did wrong as well, so I'm sure that if I do my things correctly and we're just very good with what we have been doing in the last few starts, then normally it should be all right. I think It has just been extremely difficult to put a lap in where everything just works. For some reason it's just extremely difficult to make the tyres work around the whole lap. Yeah, sometimes you have little moments here and there and it's just not very consistent, let's say it like that. And that makes it very difficult to, let's say, try and hit a perfect lap. So every lap that you put on the board was a bit of guessing what was going to happen, which doesn't make it very nice to drive. But I think we handled the situation well. We did the best we could and the car definitely felt a little bit nicer compared to yesterday. No, I think it's quite warm, but also it is very slippery around here. The tyres don't really seem to work that well. When you combine those things, it just makes it really tricky. Yeah, it definitely felt a bit more connected, let's say it like that, a bit more predictable, which hopefully will help me tomorrow in the race. Honestly, the only thing that we can control is within ourselves. So that's what we'll focus on. As long as I'm happy with my balance in the race, I think we'll be alright. Yeah, it just needs to be a bit better than what we had today in the race. I think if we can achieve something like that, that we're in a bit of a happier window, then I'm sure we'll be quick. Alright. Good luck. Thanks for that. Charles, let's come to you now. Two front-row starts for you this weekend. How happy are you with your car? It's just super unpredictable. It's quite frustrating. I mean, it's not really fun to drive like that. But, yeah, I can't tell you what went wrong because I did the same thing and then you come out of corners and you suddenly lose one tenth or whatever. I'm like, ‘alright? It's just a bit less grip’. It's just, you know, some qualifyings you go in saying ‘OK, I can improve here and there’. You know, the tyres are quite consistent and you can just push. Here it just feels like you have no idea really, like, what you're going to get. And that makes it really difficult. And yeah, I mean, my first sector was a little bit better, but then the middle sector, it just fell away from me again for whatever reason. And then I think I was quite equal into the last corner. So I just tried to brake a bit later, like a tiny front lock. And then you miss the momentum out of the corner. Yeah, that's what it is. For sure. I mean, compared to 2015, I think it has grown a lot. I think if you compare it to the population they have, it's still very, very low. But for sure we get, yeah, recognised a lot more. I prefer, of course, that I was not known. but no, it's good. I mean the fan atmosphere is great. You can see it's a lot busier in the cities. I mean, our prime example is of course Austin, you know. From 2015 to now it's definitely a lot busier, a lot more fans in town, recognising you in the hotels as well and that's great for the sport. I think it's everything. So the track, the tyres, the car, the weather… Yeah, it's just very low grip. Yeah, they overheat very quickly for whatever reason. Yeah, I think they are conservative. But at the same time, we're already overheating, which, yeah… I mean, I would like a bit more races like two stops, three stops. I think it's a lot more fun than having a straightforward one-stop. It's not really that challenging, I think, also for the teams and drivers also. So yeah, when you have a race like in China, you can do a two-stop. I think it just opens up a bit more flexibility in the pit windows and it's a lot more fun. Maybe we could try to go softer, but we have to speak to Pirelli about that. I don't know if they want to do that. It's a lot of things that come together that make it very tricky around here. I think the cornering speeds are also super low. So if your tyre is a little bit out of the window and you slide a little bit, you lose immediately a lot of lap time in the low-speed corners. So yeah if we would have a few more fast corners that would be in general I think always a bit more preferred.",Miami,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"It felt so much on the limit. Obviously, it was very close until Q3, where when we started to push for the last one or two tenths, we started to lose the tyres in Sector 2 and 3, overheating them quite a bit. Sector 1 was actually feeling really good, but then Sector 2 and 3 we were losing too much. So today, that's where we lost a little bit of time. However, the race is long tomorrow. This morning we showed a good pace. So I hope tomorrow we can put Max under a bit more pressure. Yeah, this and keeping the DRS if we don't get past by Turn 1. DRS is super powerful here. And if we lose it after the first lap, then it's always difficult to come back within DRS. So we must not lose it. But first of all, there will be the start. This morning we had a good one. And tomorrow I'll try to have an even better one. Happy. I mean, I didn't change much of it since this morning. A little bit of fine-tuning, but all in all, we were quite in a good place. However, as Max said, it's extremely tricky to put a lap together. Tyres, especially in the second sector, are very inconsistent. And there are quite a few corners where you don't really know what you're going to get. And that makes it very, very difficult. So it was a very tricky qualifying. But second is not a bad place to start the race. I went all-in, but obviously it was a little bit too much. But at the end, I don't think many drivers, I think apart from Checo, the drivers at the front didn't really improve on that second timed lap, so I don't know if anything has changed wind-wise or whatsoever. But all in all, I think the first timed lap was pretty good. There were still some corners where I was not extremely happy but it was very, very difficult to put the tyres in the right window for the whole lap and I think that was the same for everybody. It's a little bit of track characteristics. I think there are still things that are a little bit not understood yet. As in China, we were struggling mostly with the low-speed and here there are quite a few low-speed corners, but we seem to be stronger. So we'll look into it and try to understand, but we've got two very good examples and I'm sure that we'll manage to have conclusions very soon. Just the Sprint race we were a little bit closer to what uh to what we normally see. However I also said that Max wasn't really happy with his car this morning in the Sprint race. So we need to see how much of a step forward he does tomorrow, being happier with the car. But as I said, we did some fine tuning on our side. We're also confident we did a step forward. so we'll see. But if we have a similar pace like we've seen this morning then I think with strategy you can always put a bit more a bit more pressure. And I hope that is the case. We've got the two cars in the front, so it's a good opportunity. I mean, the first corner is obviously always important. And Max has a very strong race pace. So yeah, it's definitely an opportunity to attack. But that's only if there is an opportunity to attack. This morning, there was. I didn’t make the pass. Tomorrow, if we manage to make it, then I will be happy. And if not, we'll be a bit more patient and try to keep those tyres to attack later on.
CS: Same. I think I almost suffered a bit the consequences of that tough start here in the Sprint. I did a really, really good start, and I nearly overtook Checo and Daniel, but then I think Checo overdid it in Turn 1 and it cost us both a position. So, yeah, I think there's things that can happen, although I think over the last few years it is true that everyone seems to be getting away at the start. It's very similar. There's no more the differences that you could see in the past. I think everyone more or less gets off the line at the same pace, you know, and it's difficult to make the difference there. Yeah, not much to add. I mean, obviously, it has changed quite a bit since my first years in 2018. It's good to see. I thought you were speaking about tension or pressure. Yeah, for us, it doesn't change much. If anything, there's, as Max said, still a little bit less. It's not like Europe, let's say, but it's growing, which is nice. I think everybody expected more blue on the car, but I think everybody loved the actual kit, which is great, but to me a Ferrari should be red, so I'm happy it's not an all-blue car.",Miami,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, honestly, a bit of a shame about this morning. I couldn't get past Daniel, but I know that the pace was there. I knew that with a clean quali, I could be in the top three. And yeah, we managed to do some clean laps. It's really tricky around here with the new Soft. Every lap is a bit of an adventure with the wind. You don't know what's going to happen. And keeping all this in mind, the laps were not too bad. Yeah, it's just that you always finish the lap and you feel like you could have gone so much faster having a cleaner lap. But it's almost impossible to put a perfect, clean lap around here. There's always one place where you slide, one place where you overheat the tyre, one place where the wind hits you different and you start struggling. So it's a very tricky balance, very tricky track to drive and uh yeah that's why being P3, clean side of the road for tomorrow might be a good place to start. Yeah it's amazing, like always in Miami really. Every time we come, every year the fans have really good energy, they give us good vibes and we enjoy coming here a lot. Yeah, not bad. I made some progress compared to yesterday. And I had a better feeling with the car, which allowed me to push the limits a bit better. At the same time, same as these guys, you know, it was a bit of a lottery out there, putting a lap together was extremely difficult. You always end the lap feeling like you could have gone two or three tenths quicker if you clean it up, But you never actually get to clean it up because next lap you always do a small mistake here and there and you leave another two tenths. And also I think we all are left with the same frustrating kind of feeling, that it's extremely difficult to put a lap together. Overall, I think tight margins, good progress and a good position to start tomorrow. I think when Max starts in front, it's always difficult to find ways to beat him. Having two cars is our best possible bet in trying to do that. And we will give it our best shot, knowing that is… Obviously, if you look at the last statistics, it's going to be extremely difficult, but we'll give it our best shot. No, unfortunately, I think the tyre compounds are a bit on the conservative side for this Grand Prix. I think we could have done maybe with softer compounds and maybe a bit more strategy variability. So, yeah, I don't expect much differences to last year. No. Unfortunately, no. I think it's a matter of a trade, you know, that you choose between downforce, power unit settings, etc. I think Daniel and Honda this weekend, they seem to have a lot of acceleration out of the low-speed corners and this was allowing them to be a very tough car to overtake. You could see that Checo on the Honda power unit managed to more or less make it stick. Obviously, they are also a bit more friendly to the Red Bulls than they are to the Ferraris because of obvious reasons. But apart from that, yeah, it was honestly very tricky. The only thing missing there was the mistake yesterday in the Sprint quali that made me start behind Daniel in the race. And when you put the compromises for set-up you don't expect to start behind an RB. So tomorrow we're starting in a more of a normal place and we'll fight people with similar downforce levels to us and similar top speed levels. And yeah, this move should make it better. Yeah, same. I think it's great to see the sport growing in the US. It's not the only place where it's growing. I was very impressed with China. After five years without going to China, you really can feel the difference, you know, last weekend out in Shanghai, the difference between China five years ago to China now, the amount of fans there were and how involved they were with the sport is unbelievable. And the US is more progressive because we are growing, I think, in a more progressive way. And it's great to see. Yeah, sometimes in the cities, it gets a bit hectic, like Max was saying, or coming into a track. But it's a price that you pay for maybe being a bit more recognised, a bit more famous, which is yeah, a good problem to have for the sport.",Miami,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it really cost us quite a bit. Unfortunately, we got the Safety Car and we lost two places. And yeah, effectively that became the race… We did the most of the race on the Hard. And yeah, once you start fighting like that, in the early laps, the life of the tyre just goes off dramatically, but at least we managed to get to the podium, but it would have been good to be one and two. Yeah, I think we were definitely lacking some pace, especially on the Medium compound. We did struggle quite happy with the balance. We changed a lot from yesterday to today. So I think, yeah, we didn't read the conditions as perfectly as we could, but overall, I think it was a strong weekend. And we understand the reasons why today the race pace was a little bit down. That would be the target. At that point the gap was already quite big and given how good his pace was on first stint in terms of degradation I knew it was going to be close but once we basically had the same pace and once you go by the car ahead and you stop fighting for I don't know how many laps we ended up fighting between Charles and myself, then it's really game over. You use so much of your tyre. You put so much energy into them that they never really come back. It's quite a high deg place and I paid the price, you know, but that was the only way I could get by Charles, because we were obviously at the same age tyres and he was really difficult to get by Charles. I obviously was on the inside of Max and had to break earlier. And Fernando was on the outside. My start wasn't that good. So yeah, that meant that I lost the place to Fernando. And again, I had to fight quite hard to get by him. Probably used a little bit too much my tyres. And that put me definitely on the back foot for the first stint. So yeah, it wasn’t a straightforward race. But I also felt like we went in the opposite way with the changes we made from the Sprint event into the race. I felt like we probably took a little bit of backwards step. Well, I think I was just basically fighting you know in the pack, you know. Once you are in the pack it's so hard to get a read from what the balance actually does. You know, when you have two, three cars ahead of you, you have a lot less load in your car, so it's really hard to know where your balance is at. It’s just a limitation that I had today. That probably is something we’ve got to review to see the directions we've taken, to see what we could have done better. I think it's a good point from Lando and Max, you know, we really have to look after, with 24 races and the amount of stress, it puts, these Sprint events to our mechanics is quite large. And I think as a sport we really have to look after our people, our mechanics. Because yeah, we are definitely on the limit. I think that's a point to consider. I think the atmosphere has been great. It's been great to be back in China after so many years and see all the fans so excited and obviously with Zhou up there it was really nice to see the first Chinese driver on the grid. So yeah, the support he got was really nice to see.",China,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Thank You. Good! Yeah. Surprised, I’m very happy. Very happy for the whole team. They deserved it. Good pit stops. Just today worked out. I don’t know why. I really wasn’t expecting it to be the kind of race we had today but got comfortable, could manage the tyres a lot, which was an easier task that what I had yesterday. And I could just push. The car felt great and I felt comfortable. So, good day, good points and another podium, so I’m very happy. I was surprised by many things. The lack of pace from Ferrari today. Our good pace and, I guess, us comparing to the Red Bull, which was so surprising. I just wasn’t expecting today at all. I got everything ready to go home early and not be on the podium. So it’s a pleasant surprise but it shows the team have done a good job. We’re working hard and it’s paying off. I made a bet how far behind the Ferrari we would finish today. I thought 35 seconds and I was very wrong with that. So yeah, happy to be wrong with myself, my own bets, but a good day for everyone. No, probably not. I mean, big improvement today compared to yesterday. So I think that's why we were probably a bit surprised. I'm surprised to be sitting here today, but it's a nice surprise of course. Difficult to say, you know, we've been struggling a little bit. I'm sure everyone does, with certain things throughout the whole season, which have always been limiting us. It probably felt similar-ish to Australia, Australia, I felt comfortable and the car felt pretty good as well. So just much better today, things came alive today, the conditions cooled down, the wind calmed down and both of these things, I think, played into our hands a little bit more. So, you know, that's why yesterday, if you asked me, what do we expect for today, It definitely was nowhere near top three, or even maybe top five, you know. So a pleasant surprise. And yeah, the car felt much better. But obviously, not quick enough to match the Red Bulls. Nothing. I don't know. What did change? We were just quicker than we thought. That's the limitations, the places we expected to struggle, probably a lot more, we didn't struggle as much in. So these longer corners, like Turn 1, have always been a big weakness for us. And part of Turn 1 was probably better than we're expecting. And like the second part was probably as we were expecting. So it's just we're still learning about the car. It's as simple as that. This track is very different. The tarmac is quite odd. Maybe that played into our hands a bit more than we were thinking, maybe with the old tarmac, we would have struggled a bit more. So just little things, you know. We're not making it up. We're giving our honest opinion on where we want to be. I think if we were to go into a weekend, and we knew we're going to be strong, we've said it. So more often than not, we don't feel that optimistic, because all year we’ve been behind Red Bull, all year we've been behind Ferrari, there's no reason for us to suddenly think we should be ahead. But yeah, nothing really pointed to us having an amazing race today, especially the Sprint race yesterday, which was our best kind of version of events of what can go down. But things just went to plan and kind of went very smoothly from that point onwards. You know, I didn't make a mistake in Turn 1 and go off. It's a good start. And got past the Aston and then you can just control the race. And that was very different to yesterday. I knew it. Yeah, there was a few f-words and s-words and so on. I knew it because it was obvious it was going to be a VSC. But it just didn't come out. So I was saying to myself, like, ‘I bet it's going to come out as soon as I go around the last corner’, and it literally did. So even my engineer said it. I said it to him. Luckily, it stayed out a long time and then it obviously went to Safety Car. It was good, I think our strategy worked out well. I felt confident in the first stint, so I could go a very long time. If the VSC went out before I got around to the pit lane I would have been a lot more annoyed than I am right now. But yeah, things obviously went our way for sure. Because it made the Red Bulls have to stop again. And that obviously put me out ahead of Checo with the Ferrari in between us. And that probably saved me a little bit. Hard to say. I think it's a track where when you're in control and you can manage things, it can really be in your favour. And I think that's where the race was so different for us yesterday, you know. I was behind the whole pack. You overheat your tyres, you just struggle. There’s not a lot you can do. And today I could control things on my own. I could break away from Charles very quickly. And then Charles was holding up Checo a lot. And Checo probably had to use a lot of his tyres to try and get past him. So yeah, it depends how you think of it. I probably maybe expected a bit more of a battle but then when I know how much he pushed in the beginning to pass the Ferrari, itt allowed me to be a bit more comfortable, which was a nice thing. Not a lot more to add. Probably a better layout than last year for sure. The track… it was my first time finishing a race here, so it feels good. But I agree with Max. To be honest, I'd always prefer the old, original race format. This is what I've grown up watching, it's what I've always liked the most. I do like just going in and having the pressure straightaway. So the fact of having one practice straight into qualifying I do like it. I think it gives people less chance to just get the car perfect and I think that's when you just start to see team, team, team, team rather than a mix. So I do think it works from that perspective. But the main point is just the toll it has on mechanics and engineers. I don't think it's too bad for us as drivers, honestly. I don't think we can be the ones to complain at all. It’s the hundreds of mechanics and engineers that we have here that have to travel so much. It's not healthy for them. It is not sustainable. So yeah, the problem is not with us. So, it's not something you should be asking us. It’s something that people should look out more for the rest of the team. And I think that's a limiting factor, not the fact of can we go in the car every day, because I think we can but not doing too much for them I think is the priority. There were a couple. I’m not surprised. I didn't notice that to be honest with you, so you’ve got a good eye, Max. I was looking at the track! The fans are always good here. They're passionate. There's was a lot of them obviously. Like, the support Zhou gets here is beautiful to see at the same time. So yeah, hopefully after this year I've got a few more and it’s only my second time here, so again next year maybe even more.",China,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it felt amazing. I mean, all weekend, I think we were incredibly quick. And yeah, it was just enjoyable to drive, every single compound as well. The restarts I think we all survived that well, and you had a car was basically on rails. And yeah, I could do whatever I wanted to with it. And those kind of weekends are of course amazing to feel and of course then to achieve basically what we did this weekend is fantastic. I mean, you hear always noises a little bit. Of course, I've had it in the past that I've retired quite close to the end. And then, yeah, there was a bit of debris, I think from a car. So I passed it with 300 and when the tyres are getting cold and old, it's very easy to puncture them and I just wanted to double check. It should normally be a good race for us. It's normally a little bit more straightforward with the strategy, but it's always quite a difficult track, you know, so I'm excited. You know, it's always quite a crazy weekend there, so it's going to be quite a busy one. Yeah, obviously, it's a great feeling. Of course, you never know when you enter the weekend, how it's going to go fully. Sprint weekend, normally always a bit more chaotic. So you always want it to go really well. But then it did go really well. So then you are very pleased, but also the performance I think now in the main race, the car was, I think, an improvement compared to the Sprint race even. So it just made my life a bit easier as well. Yeah, it could be a little bit more consistent while driving. No, not complicated it was just a bit… Just took a long time, I found, to get the first car cleared. And then I felt like we drove one more lap behind the Safety Car for nothing. So I was like, come on, speed up a bit. Then, of course, we had another Safety Car and for me it felt, again, that they took a long time to clear, because you want to race, right? And actually then I thought that because of the two Safety Cars it made it a little bit less fun, because you would have seen probably more different strategies between the cars. And now everyone was just driving more or less to the end, except I think Fernando was on a Soft, Yeah, made it I guess a little bit more straightforward. So that was a bit of a shame, I guess. I locked up in the second restart into Turn 6, I think, a little bit. So that was not ideal. Then a threw a tear-off away, which I think I could hear on the intake. It was flapping around hitting my helmet. So I don't know where it ended up. And with two laps ago, I think I drove over a little bit of debris before Turn 14. So that was a little bit scary, because with all the tyres it's easy to have a puncture at high speed when you drive over carbon. That was it I think. It was a good one, yeah. In terms of just also balance in the car, we did a good job as a team to make it even better than what it was at the start of the weekend. It’s a completely different track. You know, different tyres, different tarmac, so you never know. We need to be perfect. Need to try and be perfect. We need to always try and find the best set-up on the car, you know, to be able to show performances like we did today. So that's what we'll try to do but also on the other hand I don't want to think about it too much now. First of all to go home, and then we will prepare like we always do and hopefully that's good enough when we get there. Yeah, I mean, this track has always been nice. You know, I've always enjoyed driving here. It's quite technical, deg involved also. It does make it a special Grand Prix, a fun Grand Prix. The fans are great, you know, big grandstand, so the atmosphere is great. So it's always very nice to be here. The Sprint format was better, I think. A bit more straightforward, I would say. But yeah, let's not overdo it as well, you know, because we are already doing 24 races a year, six of these Sprint events as well. I get it. I guess it sells better and better numbers on TV, but it's also more stress on the mechanics and everything, to get everything every time tiptop, so yeah, we take it, I mean you have to deal with it, but let's not think that now we need 12 of those because it will take its toll on people as well. Lots of a girls. Load of girls were really supporting Lando, you know. Lando! Lando! Yeah, this was definitely one that I wanted to win. I've been on the podium here, but I haven’t won here before, so that was great, for sure. And yeah, I mean, I definitely just enjoyed the whole weekend. It's been really nice with a great car. Throughout the race, I mean, with the Safety Car and stuff, as always, things that you have to do well, the restarts and stuff. I guess they're tense moments. The actual start, of course, and after that, just a management race, looking after your tyes, trying to extend the gap. So yeah, busy enough, but also enjoyable.",China,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think, you know, after the Sprint race it gave us a few more ideas for the car. And I think the car worked even better in qualifying now. So yeah, definitely very happy with how the whole of qualifying went. The car was really nice to drive. And also in Q3, I think that final lap felt really decent, and also very happy to be able to drive here in the dry. Yeah, the conditions were pretty good. So it was a lot of fun. I think also coming out of a race, when you then go back to low fuel, it probably takes always one lap to get comfortable again. Plus, and of course, new tyres are getting put on every single time, so you know a bit where you can find a little bit more in every single corner, you know, little references. And also, because yesterday we had a bit of rain, we had extra sets of tyres, so you could practice a bit more. And that's why I think every time… Besides I think only my first one in Q3 every time we were going a bit faster. I think the track evolution wasn't that massive around here, but that's fine. Yeah, it was a bit confusing in Q3 where on the first run I went slower than in Q2. It might have been the wind, because it’s very difficult to understand that anyway. Around here with the wind direction it’s very sensitive to the balance of the car. But yeah, then for the final run I didn’t really know what to expect, but you just push on and everything just came a bit together, the grip felt a little bit more normal and I managed to improve, That was very nice. I think overall, the whole of qualifying I was very happy with the car, it felt very well balanced as well, so of course naturally then you can push on and that was crucial to being on pole today. For me personally, it didn’t really feel like there was a massive track evolution. Q1 maybe a little bit but also partly I guess because you come out of a race with a lot of deg, where then you put new tyres on, low fuel, you have to get into it a little bit as well, on your own side as well. But from Q2 to Q3 it was very little. Yeah, before I jumped in the car, Christian told me that if I get pole today it could be number 100 for the team. So I said “OK, that’s nice, I’ll try, you know, I’ll give it a good go’. Of course, that’s an incredible achievement for the whole team. Of course a big contribution from Seb, back in the day. But yeah fantastic to have the 1-2 in qualifying. It shows the car is again working really well and from my side it’s been a really good start to the year. I feel very confident in qualifying even compared to last year. Just a shame that we retired in Melbourne as we could have had already a very strong lead bit overall, still a great start. It definitely gave you a bit more of an idea with the deg, what to look at, what to work on for tomorrow. Of course, thew wind direction is going to change again tomorrow, so the balance of the car in some corners will be a bit different again, but I think if the car is even half as good as what it as in the Sprint I think we will be alright. Not massive. I would say maybe in FP1 a bit. But for me the track evolution wasn't that big in qualifying also. I think some people thought that maybe after FP1 you would drive the, whatever, the paint off, but it's still there more or less so. Yeah, it's fairly stable, I would say.",China,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was very intense. I nearly got knocked out in Q1. I had traffic with one of the Williams and I had to abort my lap. I came back, go back out on hot, used tyres and just made it through, P15. It was just a very messy start to qualifying. And then Q2 was a little bit more straightforward. I could really get a read into the balance. And we were making some nice progress through the session. And yeah, unfortunately there in the end, it was just not enough to get Max but overall it's a tremendous team result because the track has changed a lot. We changed a lot the car as well to adapt to the conditions. So hopefully that will also pay out tomorrow. Yeah, I think it's everything to play for tomorrow. We can be fighting from there. And we can definitely have a strong rhythm. And we've shown today that we have a fairly good pace in the long run. So I look forward for tomorrow. Yeah I didn’t have a good run in my first run of Q3, which really set me back. I don’t know what happened. Obviously tyres were a little bit cooler, but yeah, it was just a step worse. We were playing around with the front wing. So I felt like it just put us on the back foot for my final run. And then all of a sudden in the final run thing, the track was just getting quite a bit better and I managed to put a good lap together. And yeah, I think just all the way to that lap has been a very messy qualifying, starting from Q1. I nearly was knocked out and qualified 15th. I had traffic on my first attempt with a Williams and had to come back to the pits, so I was just out of position a lot of the time and unfortunately, you know, with a change of wind it was important to be out there at the right time to make sure that you get that progression, that learning from these new conditions. Yeah, we did a lot of changes, trying to adapt to the to the new conditions. Effectively, like Max says, the change in wind has been quite substantial. And I think given that it's quite a low-grip circuit, a bit of a change in the wind conditions does affect a lot more than probably other places. So, yeah, we learned a lot from the conditions earlier in the Sprint and we adjusted accordingly. So that was important for me to have a read on. Yeah, well, we did suffer a lot with a tyre deg, with rear deg especially. So yeah, just making sure that we were able to have a more stable platform was important. But obviously, that doesn't come for free, you know, and then you're making other compromises in different sort of corner speeds and yeah, I just couldn't get a good read through the conditions. I think my first proper lap was seen in Q2, run two. And yeah, then run one in Q3 was quite far off. So it wasn't the smoothest qualifying session out there. But it still is a good result for tomorrow.",China,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah. I mean, I don't know how far [ahead] Checo is. But yeah, Sector 1, I had a moment in Turn 1 and 2, I nearly lost the car. And then I said, ‘Okay, I keep going or I abort the lap?’, you know, because I lost like two tenths in two corners. But yeah, we didn't give up. We kept pushing all through the lap. Yeah, we said a good lap time. I think the car did improve since this morning. We made a few set-up changes. Let's see tomorrow if we can translate that into points. Well, I think it's the same for everybody. You cannot change the car completely because you are into the rhythm of the weekend. But you can still make some small set-up changes. Some of them are just for balance problems, but some of them are just guesses that you do into tomorrow's race and you flip the coin. So until tomorrow afternoon we will not know the answer but extremely happy and proud of the team. We are not giving up, we are not in the position we want yet, but we keep pushing. This is incredible, honestly. One of the best races of the year. Thanks to the fans, you know, they are so enthusiastic about the sport in general and they're so supportive of every driver on every team. So thank you, xièxiè, and see you tomorrow. It was very good, but not perfect. I had a moment Turn 1 and 2. I lost the car. And actually, in Turn 3, I was just thinking if it was better to abort the lap and come in, or keep on going. And I said I will brake very late into 6, try to recover that time. I recovered one tenth and I said, ‘OK, I keep going’. I recovered another tenth in Turns 9 and 10. And I said, ‘OK, now let's go for the final two corners’. And it was very much needed, because within two tenths there are like six cars, and we are leading that group of those two tenths, so happy with the lap, happy with qualifying. And these kind of laps and moments are very encouraging for the future. Happy for the team, proud of all of them. We never give up. We are not in a strong position yet, especially on race conditions, we are still maybe the fourth, fifth fastest team, but we still fighting to be better and better and today's result shows that. I don't know. We just check now the times and it's like two tenths between Checo and myself. It’s more or less what I lost. So yeah, it will be close with Checo. But it doesn't change too much to be P2, P3. We are completely out of position for tomorrow with whatever position we are. I think seventh, eighth, ninth is our natural order tomorrow when we see the chequered flag, but we are qualifying extremely well this year and we’ll take it. I started P3 this morning, and it didn't seem to have a big difference actually. Lewis started P2 and had a great start, so I think both sides are the same. It's more into 1, 2, and 3, all the action, and hopefully a clean start and we can finish the race. Yeah, I expect a difficult race. I mean, we are slower than the Ferraris, slower than the McLarens and probably the Mercedes. We are qualifying them often and then in the race we just need to wait and see. When they come, how fast they come and how many laps we can defend those positions. But it happened so far in the first four races, so I guess this fifth race is going to be no different. So yeah, I expect a race that is going to be difficult for us. But you know, we can’t say sorry for being too fast in qualifying, so let's take it. And then in in this morning, yeah, I received a penalty which obviously, I will not agree, but they have all the power to do what they think is is right and we have to accept it and move on. I think the biggest issue was in wet conditions, to be honest. It was very, very slippery. So hopefully tomorrow we have a dry race and I think it's going to be good.",China,post-qualifying,Aston Martin
Zhou Guanyu,"Of course, two opportunities this weekend. Sprint race format and it sounds very interesting, even though it's not a lot of practice, after obviously missing few years and coming back straight into one session, but I'm sure you know, we have the potential, I think the race craft has been recently OK. And for myself, I think there's parts to be moving. It will get a bit more clear Friday, get prepared, ready for the qualifying sessions and points are definitely there to take. But as we saw, it's very a complex pack, you know, the midfield battle is super tight between all the cars, so we just need to make sure all the details are correct and take the opportunities if they are there. Probably last year. Yeah, every year… Obviously the first time you become an F1 driver of course in our country they see a countrymen racing different sports, especially Formula 1, there's only 20 drivers on the grid and then they start to focus, of course, on their drivers, where their city or their country is from, so it's great to see the fan base is building up quite a lot. And also for me, I think you always have, let’s say the fans have been following motorsport for ages you know, since probably 2020, all these years when we have the Chinese Grand Prix, but then to its great to have maybe fans that have different interests in other topics and then started to follow that because of you. I think, for me, the most important part is just for the history or the background of the sports, that scenario here has not been, let's say, the most popular sport in China, of course, everybody in the country [knows] ping pong, football, basketball, these things are very famous, popular, and for people it’s maybe quite easy to play or to reach, but motorsport for them is always like a higher luxury end of sports. But I think everyone can still get involved, have that as an interest. And that's what why I'm here, for one of the reasons, and it's great to see a lot of people coming, supporting, notice the race track also off track, to see them there when you have activities. It is great to feel this energy. Firstly, my first race, I watched back in the day in 2004. The man sitting next to me [Alonso] was racing already! Can’t imagine how he is still here, racing at a very high level. But for me, of course, it's been 20 years waiting for this Grand Prix. And, yeah, let's say this journey has been not extremely easy, just because where I'm coming from, and also, you know, trying to win at least a lot of races in feeder series to be here. And then once in F1, every year, of course, when you realise that the home race is not happening, two years in a row, we try to kind of do your best to maintain your seat and then to be here, today… So for me, of course, I'm still focused on my job, like always said, I know this is very, let's say a mix of emotions going to this weekend, especially when we have on Sunday with the national anthem going on and also the memory, you know, quickly reflect on your mind. But as much as I am a race driver, I think the most important, critical thing is to do the right job on track, which is try to score points, give the maximum I have on the package on the car we have, which, I feel like we have potential even though it's not a track I know the best in terms of the layout. I never drove here in a single seater. But I still feel like we have a good opportunity with the format. And for myself, I think we just focus on that. And hopefully, it's not going to be the only one because I'm planning hopefully to stay here as long as I could. And everybody loves to be having a long career in Formula 1 and that's where we dream to be. So yeah, let's get over this weekend in a positive way, hopefully reach some good results on Sunday. For me, obviously I haven't been really driving here. Last time I drove here was in a road car, so I'm not going to comment much on that. Yeah, I mean, all the others pretty much covered everything I think. From my side you know, it's really important to have the confidence straightaway on the track and then we can quickly adapt, changing a little bit the driving line to see what we can extract from the set-up, balance and also the circuit come to quali all the teams, drivers are still going to be learning new things for our quali laps. Firstly, I think I've been extremely busy. One of the busiest men probably in Shanghai over the last week and a half after the Japanese Grand Prix. I came straight back, a lot activities done. And also a lot of meet and greets with fans, people like that. It's great to say, for support from the country already. And for me, the pressure, of course, this race is a little bit higher, but I don't think it gets much more than probably my first race, my debut in Formula 1 because by now everything feels a lot more familiar than back in the day. You know, everything was very new. And first day here is completely different to now, third season. So I'm just going to use that, like I already mentioned, this is a normal weekend, as much as I, you know, will enjoy this whole weekend experience. And then yeah, for me, working together with some Chinese brands or car companies, they are based in the Geely group, so, for me, one of the biggest car companies in the whole China. So, one day, hopefully a dream to have manufacturers involved in Formula 1 that can help a lot, not just myself, also other young generations coming from China, Chinese drivers to help them guide their way into Formula 1. Of course, I would love to have more companies like that involved. But now, you know, I'm happy with what I'm driving with Sauber and, you know, focus on the weekend job and try to do the best possible. I think mainly the history, the culture with motorsports only started 20 years ago. So if you're considering, let's say, the European, how much Formula 1, the passion they had, now is, you know, improving this is probably this Grand Prix is being a record in terms of the tickets. It was sold out, always in like 20 or 30 minutes, and, you know, it used to be, you could still always find a few seats, you know, two to three weeks before the race, so, never been like this before. But you really see the country is growing, but also it’s having some high inputs, having more like multiple companies, manufacturers, starting being involved with different Formula 1 teams. But of course, I think to be able to have more drivers on this grid is going to be very difficult for the next 5, 10 years, just because, for example, a perfect example, Honda, they have this Honda dream project, and you have young drivers who get picked up from very young age, and that culture of motorsport in Japan is very high. But for us, we need to build that and it doesn't take you know… Twenty years is not enough. It takes another probably 5, 10 years to build in the similar level, then you can reach out to Europe, hopefully, put them in the feeder series. And yeah, if they can do well, winning races, finishing top there in their championship, and they can, you know, guide their way to Formula 1, but I don't think it's been a very easy job for, you know, for the next few years for any drivers to be here. Yeah, I mean, for me, I obviously don't want to get into too much on the politics side and things in government. But let's say the biggest difference in motorsports, Formula 1 is that you don't get too much of a country’s support behind. And of course, to being an F1 driver, you need some financial support. That's clear. But I don't think in China we have enough families, people that have the budget, and also, hopefully, the interests that they can get involved in Formula 1. But it takes a lot. It's easy to be a racing driver as a hobby. But to take this professional journey, only 20 of us drivers to be here, it's not an easy one. The amount of sacrifice and also the hard work behind the scenes for every individual drivers to be there, it's very complex. And also, it takes a lot of time. And for me, happy to be kind of the role model in this country. But still, I think you need to put effort into that. And also, having a lot companies, manufacturer involved in helping the young generation, to guide them forward. And yeah, let's see what I can do. Maybe when I retire from racing to help more, but at the moment, I'm just hoping to inspire some young people, and they can come a long way. Yeah, for myself, I think it's an incredible journey that Fernando has done. And, of course, it's a lot easier to say than to do. I would love to be racing in Formula 1 for many more years, that's for sure. That's what I’m most passionate about and driving these cars as well. And from my side, of course, back in the day, he was kind of my racing role model that I was looking for and it's great to be seeing him still performing a very high level. And yeah, just really enjoy it. Hopefully we can sooner battle for some positions on track and having some fun.",China,thursday,Sauber
Fernando Alonso,"Well, thanks. First of all, it's never an easy time when you have to make some decisions, especially right now, as for me it’s probably my last contract. So yeah, I wanted to make sure that it was the right decision, first of all, to keep racing in Formula 1, and to have the strength and the motivation to keep racing for a few more years, from my side. And then, after that, just making sure that the team has the targets and the goals for the next few years to be ambitious and to try to keep getting better and better. So yeah. It was, I think, a very happy decision for me. Obviously extremely proud to represent Aston Martin for the next few years. We started the journey last year, and in a very good way and we keep on working. So yeah, extremely proud and happy. Let's see what we can do. I think, you know, with the new regulations in 2026, there is going to be a possibility for everyone to mix the cars a little bit and have an opportunity. Obviously, we will be with Honda, we will be the only team with the power unit from Honda, which obviously, it is a little bit different than being a customer engine now with Mercedes. So hopefully we have a little bit of an improvement there. Also, I think with Aramco, the biofuels and sustainability that will come into 2026, maybe we have a little bit of an opportunity there as well. And the team is just getting better and better – new facilities, new campus, new wind tunnel coming this summer. So you have a lot of things in place to be a very powerful team in the future. And I wanted to be part of it. No, not really. I think we just sat together after Japan and yeah, we arrived to a conclusion and an agreement was reached in in one two days. So it was very, very simple. And once we got the agreement we announced it and everything is a little bit more simple than what it looks from the outside, that, you know, there are a lot of rumours, a lot of things going on for different teams and different drivers and deadlines here, deadlines there. But for us, you know, we were just loyal to each other, we just kept our word. And once we sign it, and we agree on something, we announced it. So for us it was much more simple than maybe for other people. Well, as I said, last week, I think there is no point to really talk too much, because now it's done and I'm with Aston, and I would like to talk only about Aston. And as I said last week, you know, there were some talks with everyone, as I think it is normal for everyone in this moment, but they were just light conversation. I don't think so. I think, you know, Lance and myself, we are trying to help the team as much as we can. I think we have two different driving styles. In some conditions, we have two different feelings with the car. I think Lance is a lot more sensitive to things than what I am, which is, I think, very, very important for the team. I think the analysis that Lance can reach and can feed back to the team is crucial to us and to improve the car. I'm a little bit insensitive to things sometimes. And this is not a good thing. So yeah. I think we are trying to help us learn as much as we can. And I think the direction that we develop the car and how we finalise, normally, the set-ups on a weekend, is exactly the same. So we arrive to the same conclusion, maybe in a different way. And I think those two different styles are just a good thing for us. Well, I think sometimes I drive the car around the problems that we have. And that's sometimes a good thing, because I can drive any car at any moment and extract 90% of it. But to reach the 100% of the potential of the car, sometimes I'm not able to do that without, as I said, sometimes the help from my team-mate on the special details from the set-up or balance problems here and there. So, you know, I think we benefit from each other in many different ways. And this is a good thing at the moment. I don't think it’s going to change much the approach to any other Sprint weekend that we had last year. We only have now the opportunity after the Sprint race to change the car. So everything that we may learn on the qualifying and that mini race, we may change things for the rest of the weekend and that will be the only freedom that we have now – and it will be used for sure. Well, they are winning the championship now, so they are demonstrating that they have the discipline and the work that is needed to succeed in Formula 1. Obviously, new regulations, no one knows what could happen in 2026. But yeah, we are extremely happy to work with Honda. And to be, as I said, a works team for the power unit, I think it makes a huge difference to what we currently have. So that's a plus and that's one of the reasons that I stayed into the new regulations, and to have the opportunity to work with Honda again. And as I said, I feel that we will have an advantage. Yeah, let's wait and see. Until we drive we will not know. Yeah, I love this this place as well. The circuit is very challenging. Turn 1 being the most special corner, very unique in the championship. So yeah, let's see, normally high deg. Lots of overtaking opportunities. So good racing.
ZG: Yeah, for me, obviously, you know, trying a few simulators, Turn 1 looks to be the most tricky part of the circuit. And yeah, in general, I think the circuit is more like medium-, high-speed, with a few overtaking spots on the back straight. So yeah, will be fun, I think it definitely won't be a boring race on the weekend. Not much to say. To good, yes? Let's see tomorrow on track.",China,thursday,Aston Martin
Nico Hülkenberg,"Well, a little bit of improved and enhanced performance, hopefully. It's not, you know, a major, huge update, you know, some little bits and bobs that look good on paper and in theory, but as always, you know, you have to verify them on track, make sure the correlation is good. But, yeah, better to have an upgrade this early in the season in the tight midfield battle than the not to have them. It should. It really should. I hope so. It's a lot more low speed content, I think, which is whether the car feels more at home. Always good memories here. I've raced here nine times and really liked the flow and the layout of the circuit. So yeah, exciting one ahead. It’s not just me. I think there are a few drivers who have done a fair few weekends here and years. Some more, some less. But yeah, personally, I'm quite excited. You know, less practice sessions obviously always kind of presents more opportunity maybe, for more chances. But you know, we have to make sure that we get it right ourselves. Obviously. Everyone isn't in the same situation there, but I feel quite OK going into this weekend with just the one hour of practice. Not sure, not necessarily. It's always difficult to you know, to foresee that and to predict. For some it might move quite quickly, for some maybe not. But it's definitely a very interesting situation right now, the driver market is very dynamic, very fluid. And I'm sure all the drivers with no contract for 2025 are pretty busy right now having lots of conversations, checking options, and trying to obviously fix the future. Same for me. Yep, same. It depends on the type of the paint. We'll get more of an idea once the Safety Car out, maybe in the afternoon. But same for everyone. Personally, I like it. It's got a nice flow to it. Some technical bits, obviously a few really long duration corners. Turn 1. 2, it feels like it's going on forever and then it gets really tight. And then that Turn 14 leading on to the long straight. But yeah, good memories and good vibe around here for me. It's going to be busy. It's going to be hectic, you know, to process everything very quickly going into a Sprint weekend. It’s a challenge, but also offers opportunities, probably. It was for the young ones? Yeah, I mean, all of what they said. Obviously, I'm not as far away as these guys. It’s always difficult to predict the future, how long you want to do something. I think a couple more years. Forty? It's not that crazy far away from me personally. Let's see.",China,thursday,Haas
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah, well, first of all, a very good job from the team really to bring, you know, some upgrades early on than what was planned on my car, which is a remarkable effort by the team. So, good that we can test that early and see what it brings to the car. Obviously, we still don't expect massive changes in terms of performance. But we can always have a good surprise and we will see where that leads us onto the track later in the weekend. I think it depends where. I think in Australia we were looking to be fighting for points. We were fighting with Haas there. It was looking good until that tear-off came in the break duct. Obviously, yes, we've qualified now twice in Q2, in Australia and in Suzuka. But, you know, in Suzuka we also had damage at the start, which didn't help things but we struggled more, definitely, Suzuka. So I think we did a step forward in qualifying recently, but we still need to work on the race pace, and see if we can hold on to the other cars, that’s the main thing. We'll see. I don’t know. Yeah, I mean, it's not really different to any other Sprint weekend. It's just that here… We haven't been here for a while, for sure, so if FP1 is going to be crucial before you get to that first Sprint qualifying. You know, luckily, if things go wrong in that first stage of the weekend, you can always change the set-up back, which is a new thing. So, yeah, probably a bit more experimental things you can try for that first stage of the weekend, but otherwise, yeah, it's not a huge difference. Yeah, I agree with Charles, I mean, I haven't been around it. I just saw pictures for the moment. It could be slippery in the wet, could be very high grip, we can't really tell until we really try. But that's what I was, you know, speaking to Charles about. A long time ago, in our go-kart days, there was sort of paint put on tracks and it used to put down rubber and keep rubber a lot in corners. So that had a lot of grip. I don't expect that to be the case. But, you know, it could do a lot of different things. I look forward to driving on this track. Again, as the other guys said, I think it's very unique to have such long corners at such high speed in the championship. I think it opens up for good racing opportunities as well, just before the long straight for the traction. And, yeah, at the end of the straight is where you have a big braking, so I think it's quite a cool one for racing. So yeah, a long time that we haven't race here, new cars as well. So hopefully we can follow better through the high speed. And yeah, we'll see what that brings us. Yeah, a lot for us to discover on our side, you know, having the upgrades on the car as well on top of having not raced here for four or five years. There's going to be a lot to see, a lot of fine tuning needed, a lot of understanding, going through. So, we don't really have enough time, let's put it that way, before we get into an important session. But it's part of the game. It's a challenge that I like, you know. You need to be ready. You need to nail every little detail before you get to the session that counts and yeah, that's pretty cool as a challenge. Huge respect for Fernando. Since I've been very little I've been watching him competing, against Michael and you know, these two guys are the guys that gave me the love for the sport. So, to still be racing with Fernando now it's very incredible. And just to see the career he has done, he’s won in everything, basically. He’s won in karting, he’s won in Le Mans, in the States in sports cars, everything he’s competed in he has almost won. And that's more than remarkable. And it's a dream carrier for any athlete or racing driver. So yeah, I don't know if I would still be racing at his age. But truly, his dedication is something that is an example for all of us.",China,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"Yes, a dog. I've always had dogs within my family, but never had my own. And yeah, he joined last Monday and it's been great. My girlfriend, but I do take care of him when I'm at home. I think the level of confidence is quite stable since the beginning of the season. On paper, I think it’s a track where we could be a bit stronger compared to Suzuka. But we'll just approach it in the same way. I still think that Red Bull will have the upper hand this weekend and we'll just have to focus on ourselves, because it can be very easy, as we've seen, especially in qualifying into Suzuka, I didn’t do a good job Saturday and then you don't go from fourth to fifth but you go from fourth to eighth. And so it's going to be very important, especially on a Sprint weekend, we've got two qualifyings these this weekend to extract the maximum out of the car on both qualifyings and then in the race. I think we are we are quite strong this year. I think in the race we will be yes. But let's see. Obviously it's been a very long time since we drove here, so yeah, I saw the track was painted or there was something strange on it, so also this we'll have to see how our car behaves on that. And what are the main limitations in the race but on paper I think we should be closer to them, yes. No, I think it's as simple as he's doing a better job. Again, I think in Bahrain, it's difficult to compare, because on my side, I was facing issues. And I think it was a very strong weekend apart from that on my side. However, in the last two races, he’s just been stronger. So it's up to me now to work, especially on the qualifying pace, which is normally a strength. I've been struggling to put the lap together. It's a very fine line to get it right or completely wrong on the out lap and putting the tyres in the right window. And for now, I have been struggling more than what Carlos has done. And he's driving at a very high level, which I think is great for the team. It’s great for me as well. And I have been working a lot on that. And normally when I work on points, I'm quite confident on improving pretty quickly. So I'm not worried. But obviously now I need to show that on track, starting from tomorrow in qualifying. Yeah, it's difficult to predict because I think also, it depends a lot on the type of paint they use. And that can cause different issues or have no issues at all, which hope it's the latter that will be the case tomorrow, but for now, it's very difficult to predict. I have only seen pictures, so I haven't gone around the track yet. I don't think it's the same everywhere, which also might not be great. But yeah, before adding further comments, I think we just have to drive and see how it feels. Maybe it's actually a completely fine, so we'll find out tomorrow. I have only race twice here. But it's always been a very, very interesting track. Very nice track to drive on and a track where there are many, many different lines possible, especially in Turns 1, 2, 3. And all those long corners, they are very different ways of taking those corners, which makes it exciting for us. And having only one free practice before qualifying, we'll have to find the best way as quickly as possible. But again, it's an exciting challenge. Yeah, no particular feelings obviously. As it's Sprint weekend, there's more preparation going into a Sprint and even more so on a track where we haven't been for five years. However, there are also lots of unknown the paint, for example, as well as the track changes because the track changes over time, the bumps are maybe a bit bigger compared to a few years ago when we came here, but this we will only learn, all this new information, tomorrow. So adapting quickly will be very important. But there's been a lot of preparation as it's always the case on Sprint weekends. Yeah, it's difficult to imagine myself in 15 or 18 years’ time still in Formula 1. However, we can definitely see how motivated Fernando still is and how high of a level he's still performing at the moment and this is what matters at the end. Age is a number but what he's showing on track is still at a very, very high level. On my side, I would love to be racing still for many years. However, I'm not so sure whether in Formula 1. I would like to experience other things like Le Mans, that’s definitely a place where I will see myself race one day. But yeah, I mean as long as I am fully motivated then I will race and I love what I do,. so for now that's what I want to do for the longest time possible.",China,thursday,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Probably not as high as Suzuka. I think that's our opinion. But still in a good position. I think we've been happy with how the season started. I think we're in a good qualifying battle with Aston, Mercedes, it’s very close and even last weekend ahead of Ferrari, but I think the order is still clear. And I think in the racing we've done a good job. Not as good as Red Bull but and Ferrari, but I'm a head of Aston and Mercedes. So I think we're in a good spot. This wasn't a great circuit for us in 2019 but many things have changed since then. So I'm so optimistic we can have a good weekend. The long corners. Just, like, Turn 1. Yeah, this type of corner is just not good for us. Similar to, say, Zandvoort, that kind of experience for us. So yeah, we've got some things to try. And we're constantly trying to improve these areas. But it's an area we know is one of our biggest weaknesses, and maybe we kind of get away with it in qualifying but especially into the race becomes a bigger problem for us. Not anytime soon, that's for sure. I think we can. Right place, right time, if we improve the car how we need to. Honestly, there weren't too many frustrations with Suzuka. I think everything went pretty much as expected. I don't think we did a perfect job and I think we probably should have finished one place higher up, potentially. But I don't think it was far off. We've been the same place all season. We've been behind Red Bull, we've been behind Ferrari and we've been a bit of a step ahead of the other two teams come the race. And that's exactly how last weekend went. So I don't think there's too many frustrations. But we know the issues, we know what we have to improve. And if we can improve them. I think Andrea is right. I think we can win races this year. And we can be competitive with these other two teams ahead of us. But that's an if. And you know, we have to work hard to improve the car in some of these certain areas, which have been a big challenge for us over the last many years, not just for years, but last many years. But if we can, then I'm confident we can have some good races. I have no idea. So I think we have to wait and see honestly, I think that's something new, something we don't think we've seen before, so hard to predict exactly what's going to happen. So I honestly have no idea. So I'll see you tomorrow. I always raced here once, but I didn't finish the race. So not the best memories. But yeah, it was still in my first season. So everything was new back then. But it's always been a cool track to drive. Definitely was not my back then. But excited to give it another crack and see what we can do this weekend. I guess just excited. Always excited for every weekend, but especially when you haven't been to a place for a while. For me, I didn't get a proper experience of it back in 2019. So things have changed. I'm a very different driver to what I was back then. So I'm excited to see what it brings and how the whole weekend pans out I think anyway being a Sprint race and having two opportunities to try and nail the set-up for the first quali and then the set-up for the second quali. I think also there is plenty of opportunity. So I don't think it’s not going to be exciting for anyone. I think there's a lot of opportunities on the table, there's a lot of things that can go wrong at the same time, so excited for all of it. I’d better be careful what I say. I think it takes a lot of dedication. I don't think anyone thinks Fernando lacks that in any way. I think he shows that with everything that he does in life. Whether it's at the track or away from the track, you know, in different sports or whatever. So it depends what you want to do. Everyone is different. It's rare that you see someone commit for so long in any sport, you know, he's probably one of the oldest guys competing at the top of any sport in the world and I think to be able to do that at the level that he has done and continues to do, you're probably never going to potentially see it again, you know within Formula 1 and if you do, it's going be extremely rare. So yeah, I think a lot of lot of respect for that kind of thing. I have no idea if I want to do it in 20 years’ time, if I'm still going strong, but I love where I am now and I continue to do such a thing. Yeah, we'll see.",China,thursday,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Always exciting. You don't get many chances, but we had a good car today. I could fight. I did some good laps, especially in Q3. So I'm very happy with today. It's always enjoyable here in front of the fans and a good one for us as McLaren. You know, we had a good race her last year. We had a good race last weekend. So nice to still be here. Of course. You know we've had a good weekend. We've made some good steps forward. We're trying to catch up to these two Red Bulls but they're doing a good job, the whole team's doing a good job, so fair play to them. But we're working hard and the hard work is paying off slowly, so we'll keep pushing. But today's a good start to the weekend. Tomorrow is the main job. Also quite decent. So, yeah, I'm just not very happy with myself, you know, with how my long run was. So then, actually, of course, everyone else looks a bit better. Closer, but probably not as close as we were today. It was close between many people, you know, us, Mercedes, Aston, Ferrari. They didn't seem to have quite the advantage as the last few weekends. So between eight cars, we knew it was going to be tricky. So to come out on top, behind the fastest two, I think is a good job by us. So I'm happy. It was tricky to put in the good laps, but my two Q3 laps I was the happiest with, which is always a good bonus. And two tenths is not far away. I think if we kind of look back to where we were last year we were even further away, I think five tenths off of pole. And this is the first track we've come back to, which is where we had our upgrades last season. So I think it's our best comparison of how we've improved over the winter and we're quite a bit closer. So I think that's a very good sign. The car's exactly the same. I don't know. There's not a lot to do. You know, first lap, try and get a good start. Obviously last year I was side by side with Max into Turn 1. So hopefully trying to redo that. But it's tricky. They're quick. They complained about their race pace, but I don't think they've had a bad race in the last, four or five years, so I think they're going to be good tomorrow. Of course we've got a lot of pressure from behind so we have to keep an eye on the mirrors. But at the same time I want to go forward and I think we have pace to stay where we are, so that's my goal. I'll say yes. It's so tricky. Sergio's doing a good job, so that's one much harder car to kind of keep up with. But we proved last year when we were further away from them that we could keep in touch and not be miles behind. So that will be our target for tomorrow. But I think realistically, we're still too far away to challenge them. They're too quick for us. Yes, we are quicker in quali, but in the race, normally, they always pull away a bit more. So, I think we'll be realistic. I'm always realistic when I say it. So I think our competition's with the guys behind. And at the same time, I'll do my best to push forward. Kind of like they both said, Sergio and Max, as soon as you push that little bit more, you pay the price just that little bit. And it's such a fine line between over-pushing and under-pushing. So I was very happy with my first lap that I did, so Q2, Run 1. So I was happy to try a few more things to try and unlock something more. It was still a good lap. It was, what, eight hundredths or something off my first. But just a couple little bits, mainly Sector 1, where I just try and push that little bit more. But as soon as I pushed that little bit more, I just lost the front tyres a bit. And so easy to go over the limit. So apart from that, I gained in some other corners. Clearly not enough to kind of make a two-tenth jump or something that I really needed. So, yeah, they're just both good laps, both pretty similar. Just one was better than the other. I don't have much to add. It looks nicer, yes. I think it helps us a bit more, honestly. Our performance is better, so I'll take it. I wouldn't mind a bit of sun on my face. Checo is nice and tanned, and I've lost mine a little bit! I think it's helped us, so I would say it's better this way.",Japan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was close today, really close with Max. It felt like a good lap. It was quite tricky out there, actually. Especially closing out the laps it was quite easy to lose a couple of tenths into the last section, into the chicane, So we hooked it in all together, but unfortunately it was just not enough. Yeah, I think we've been really close all weekend, all the way through qualifying as well. And when you are in that little margins, you know, anything can make a difference. I didn't have a great exit opening up the lap, so probably that could have been the difference, you know, but I think we are in a good position for tomorrow. I think our long-run pace hasn't been that strong this morning, but we worked quite a bit, so hopefully tomorrow we will be able to be strong. Yes, thank you. Yeah, it was, like Max said, everything was on the margin. It was so easy to lose a tenth or two just by over-pushing a little bit in some of the corners. The amount of energy that we put into the tyres around here, it's quite high, so it was quite difficult just to get the perfect lap nailed. It was close. It was close today, but I think the whole weekend has been good. We've made some good progress. We managed to keep that consistency through the qualifying. And now, yeah, let's see what we are able to do tomorrow. I don't think we are looking great at the moment in our long-run pace, but we've done some changes and hopefully that will translate into a better race pace. Like Carlos would say, we stopped inventing. We were playing around with the car far too much and just going through it and I think now we have a much better base. We are a lot happier, and the weekends just progress. And I think when we came here last year, we were at the stage of our season where anything was working. And when you are in that, you just go around circles and circles. And then we found out in the end, towards the end of the year, that it was better. just step back and don't try to chase it too much with the set-up because then you start compromising other things. And I think that's been the case for this year. So yeah, I'm a lot more comfortable, a lot more happier and the confidence is slowly coming back. Same. It's more fun because it gives a nicer time over one lap, I think, to the tyre. And also, you don't have the sun on your face, which around here it's a nightmare. Going into some of those high-speed corners with the sun on your face is really hard to really nail it. So, yeah, in that regard, it was good. Degradation-wise, I think this place is... You put so much energy into the tyres that it makes no difference. Yeah, I think it hasn't changed much the characteristic. I think we just improved. We got a better car. I think for now it's… Probably this track, it's hard to see the upgrade, because it's more biased to other circuits. So I think from that point of view, we got to wait a couple of races to really learn from it, from that package.",Japan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was quite close at the end. I think overall, you know, this track is very sensitive with the tyres, you know, with the tarmac being really aggressive. And when you really want to go to the limit, it doesn't always work out. But nevertheless, I think, you know, the most important thing is to be on pole. Of course you want every lap to be perfect but around a track like this that's not always the case. But yeah overall very good day good starting position for tomorrow and of course tomorrow is what counts. Well, I mean it's great as a team of course to be P1 and P2 and hopefully of course we can keep that going also for tomorrow. I think around here in Suzuka it's always very nice when the fuel comes out, the balance is more or less there and then you can push flat out. So it's always very, very nice. And of course with the cars improving every single year, it makes it even better, especially the high speed. It feels really, really cool. So that made it really nice today. Well, I started to lose time from Turn 13 onwards, so it's very sensitive around here with the tyres. As soon as you push maybe a bit too hard in Sector 1, you run out of tyres at the end, and that's what happened to me in my final lap. So that's why I didn't really improve a lot. Also, my last chicane, because the front tyres were giving up, I didn't hit the kerb how it should have been. Let's say that wasn't ideal, but it was still good enough. Of course, I always want it to be perfect, but that's not possible. Luckily, it was still good enough today. Yeah, I mean, it's a lot of flat out around this track. So you gain, of course, a little bit in Sector 1, but it's not like a second here and there. So the evolution is there, but I didn't feel like it was massive throughout qualifying. It's more, I think, just fine-tuning the car and then really risking it all in Q3. Yeah, I think so far I haven't been happy with my long runs. I think the pace wasn't what I would have liked. So it's a bit of a question mark going into tomorrow because looking at the long runs, especially Ferrari, they look very comfortable. So maybe they were not so quick over one lap today, but they were definitely fast in the long run. So we'll have to wait and see how that will evolve tomorrow in the race. Yeah, I mean, I cannot look inside the Ferrari garage to see why that is. But it's quite obvious that then in the long run they seem quite competitive. So, yeah, I mean, we'll see tomorrow, of course, why that is or if it actually is the case like that. From our side, yeah, I have some ideas of what we have to look into to make tomorrow better, and that's also what we already changed after FP3. So hopefully that will be better for tomorrow. I mean, our race place is still not too bad, but it's not how I have been feeling in some of the races this year, last year, as comfortable, let's say, like that. But hopefully with the changes that we made, it will be better. Yeah, I think it also looks nicer with the cherry blossoms and it's nice for the pictures. It makes also more sense, I think, around this time of the year to be here when we anyway have Australia, then now here, Suzuka, and then China. The only thing maybe is that to put Suzuka and China back-to-back will be a good idea for the future. And then maybe also add in Singapore. But, yeah, it's nicer. There's always naturally a bit more grip when it's colder. And I think that especially on a track like this where it's very heavy on tyres, it's always a bit nicer like that. A bit more of a supervising role maybe to double check some things but of course also some things that you change on the car. You know here and there it's a bit of a rush job sometimes when you want to change in between FP1 or 2 or overnight. Sometimes it can be some big things that you want to change and you run out of time because of a curfew or whatever. Yeah, so basically just make sure that you double-check stuff because everyone is always very pressured and you don't put the blame on one single person. But it's always nice that there is a guy that maybe just goes after a few things and then some more things are coming. But it's just basically more to just double-check stuff in general. Yeah, I mean, it's always very difficult to say when you haven't run the previous package here as well. But, I mean, naturally it should be a step forward, so we, of course, take it. And, yeah, we just work from there, you know, try to understand it more and try to optimise it even more. Thank you. Yeah, high speed is quite good with these cars, but in the low speed, it does feel like a boat. But yeah, luckily there are not too many low-speed corners around here. And actually, I think in a fun car anyway, like high-speed corners are more fun. Yeah, the old cars were a bit more agile, but this car definitely generates a lot of downforce in the high-speed corners. Yeah, I mean, I have a very good relationship with Leroy already from my start at Red Bull from 2016 onwards. And he was my number one, I think, until the end of 2020, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, it's been a while. We've had a few good years. And then he moved into a bit of a different role where I think initially was a bit more based at the factory. Then he came back to the track and a bit more like sharing duties as a chief mechanic. And then he got a great opportunity at Sauber, and I don't blame him for trying something new. Yeah, I mean, we're still good friends. We have shared a lot of great moments together. And yeah, sometimes in life, you get opportunities and you maybe go a bit out of your comfort zone. You try something new. If it doesn't work out, you can always come back, right? So, so good. We had a short briefing. It's good. No, I think everyone's a bit tired. Yeah, tired of it!",Japan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, I had a good race, to be honest. Very happy, because it was quite tough out there with the degradation, but then suddenly the clouds came, the degradation went a lot lower, and suddenly I thought that, yeah, maybe one stop was quicker and we were on the two. I had to overtake a lot of cars out there today and, yeah, overtaking was tricky. Like always at Suzuka, you really need to nail the last chicane to get a good run into Turn 1. I could finish my moves, but it was tough out there. Honestly, I thought it was on, but I thought it was going to be very difficult to get back into the fourth or P3. How tricky it was to overtake the Mercedes on the second stint and how difficult it was to follow? I knew I needed a very big delta to approach Lando and Charles, and in the end, we managed. I was quick on that Hard tyre. I really liked how the Hard gave me a good feeling to push. And I could, yeah, get the moves done and get that podium. I think it's going to be a tough weekend for everyone. I think going into a Sprint to a track that we haven't been in four or five years, only one hour of practice, is going to be a challenge. Might be resurfaced also, so it's going to be a good one. Yeah, let's get a couple good weeks to keep training and keep recovering, and I'll get back in China flat out. We kind of knew our race pace was better than our qualifying pace. Still probably not enough to go for a win because obviously starting P4 and given how good the race pace of the Red Bull is, it’s almost impossible to think about a win, but I was hopeful of achieving a podium that in the end we managed to achieve, even if it was a very tough race, very strategic. The track condition changed a lot through the race. We went from a very sunny track that we hadn't had all weekend to a very cloudy track. The degradation went down a lot and you could push a lot more on the tyres halfway through the race. And yeah, this changed the whole situation quite a lot. At one point, I thought the podium wasn't possible, but then with a new Hard, the pace was mega and I could get back onto the podium. Yeah, very satisfying. We exactly improved the car in the places that we wanted to improve it, and Suzuka proves it. Still, places like Suzuka, we are not as quick as the Red Bull, which is the target, but as soon as we bring a good upgrade to the car that goes in the right direction, hopefully it can get us closer. But yeah, we've improved everywhere, and especially in the race pace. It also allows us to have more strategic flexibility, that last year we didn't have. It allows me to go forward in the races and instead of looking in my mirrors all the time to offset myself with strategy and then overtake people, which is something that last year wasn't on the cards at any point. So, happy and makes me enjoy more racing. I think they are definitely going to have an advantage in the first third of the season until we bring one or two upgrades that makes us fight them more consistently, but by that time maybe it's a bit too late with the advantage that they might have on the championship. In the meantime, we need more Australias! Which I don't see Red Bull, as a team, making these mistakes very often, no. A shame, because also I missed a race, which for both the team and me, it could be costly in the championship. We're competing in one race less, but at the same time, We're going to give it our best shot. It's my last year in Ferrari also, so yeah, nothing to lose and we will try everything to make it back. Yeah, I think there's two different topics. I think China as a race circuit is a great one. I think it's one of our favourite ones for everyone. It's just a great racing track and a track that offers a good possibility to overtake, so a Sprint makes sense to have it there. At the same time, it's what we said in the drivers’ briefing, we say to FIA and Formula 1, with these kind of cars to go to a track with one hour of practice and straight into qualifying, with the regulations that they put us, with the plank wear and things like this, and how tricky one bump could make the car, I think it's not a good choice to choose to put the Sprint after four or five years absence. We also heard there's been resurfacing going on, so Istanbul 2.0 maybe on the cards! Yeah, I hope not. So yeah, it just shows the uncertainty. Maybe for you guys at home it's exciting, but for engineers and drivers, it's something that for me, in my opinion, we shouldn't take the risk and have a normal weekend. Yeah, not a lot to add. Danger is not a thing that goes through my head during my life. I only think about danger when I see a bad accident or, for example, the other day when I did my bike ride and I was going around the corner where Jules had the accident, you always stop for three or five minutes to think about such an unfortunate accident and the bad situation that occurred that day. But we all love what we do. We all have a smile on our face when we put on a helmet and drive to the limit like yesterday. And today at the start, we're going to Turn 1 at 300, three side by side. Anything could happen, but we're all enjoying it. And I'm sure Jules until the accident, he was enjoying himself. You know, so that's life, we've elected, this is our choice. What we need to keep doing as a sport is to make sure that everything becomes safer and safer. And for that, we need to thank the FIA. They've done an incredible job with the Halo and other things with these modern cars that allow us to think less and less about that danger and risk. And we just need to keep pushing in that direction to be able to take even more risks. That is what we like doing. We just simply improved the car. And yeah, people also might think, you know, I'm in a better moment driving and everything, but the reality is just in Formula 1, a car is very important. also, you know, having a good car. And also this year, I'm in a very good moment. I'm driving at a high level, but at the same time, having a car that just allows you to go a bit longer, allows you to be a bit closer in dirty air and play around a bit more with strategy, just allows you to shine a bit more, you know, and that's why it's important in the career of a driver also to be in a car, because last year in the races we looked like we were always going backwards, always defending. We were terrible with tyre management and that was difficult to do good races. This year, suddenly three races, two podiums, a lot of overtaking, a win. It's a completely different picture. It shows that in this sport that is very important too. Yeah, I'm just happy that this category exists because there's so much talent that for one reason or another couldn't make it to Formula 1 that had the talent to be at a very similar level to the 20 drivers that you see today in Formula 1 that having that category just gives an opportunity to those other 20 drivers to live from their passion, their driving, to battle between themselves. And I have a lot of good friends there that I fought against in different categories. And it's just great to see that they have this opportunity. And it's also good racing, as they say. So happy that it exists. think we've made progress on strategy over the last three years, progressively, but if you see a jump this year on strategy, it's purely down to the car. I think just having a car that allows you to have flexibility on strategy is something that last year we couldn't have. So, we were boxed in to stop at certain laps. We couldn't extend. We had so much deg that it looked always like people could extend and then come back on us on a harder tyre. Last year, we were just zero flexible and we couldn't do anything without racing. So it looked like we were not getting the strategy right a lot of times. But when you have a car that is better on tyres, two drivers that can push on the car more often and you have that extra flexibility, your strategy also looks better. And with this, I'm not underestimating the progress we've done. It's just I really think this helps a lot. Yeah. I personally feel the danger more for my dad than I feel it for me. Also, because he's 62 and he's taken so many risks in his life already that I keep telling him, why do you keep going and going and going when you could be at home playing golf with me or spending time with my mum? And he just keeps wanting to do this Dakar and these two or three rallies per year and there's no chance we're convincing him of otherwise. To be able to tame my dad, I think it's good for him to go and do his thing for three, four weeks per year, especially the Dakar. You know, it's two weeks per year, and he obviously has to do the preparation. But honestly, I still wonder sometimes, especially the Dakar, you know, they take risks and these rallies, you see some of the accidents, they are impressive, but good safety also, which is positive, but yeah, it'll always feels like more risk for him than for myself. You know, last week they were… Two weeks ago, I think it was the Bahrain test, your dad was showing my dad his accident or his moment! So now they're sharing their accidents and their moments, ‘Look, look! What do you think?’",Japan,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, it was a good weekend for the team. First of all, I think obviously with the start, doing that restart again is always quite hard to keep the focus for such a long period of time. It worked alright. My second start was a little bit better, but just not enough to get Max. I think we paid the price a little bit because we were a little bit off balance on that first stint, which meant we couldn't keep it alive. We had to box and we were undercut by Lando. And then I had to push too much on that Medium stint. But then on the Hard stint, I was a lot more comfortable. The pace came back. But yeah, I think I suffered a bit from that first stint, a bit unbalanced. Yeah, definitely. I think we are in a good momentum. I think if you remember here last year, it was probably my worst weekend. So I think if we are strong in places like this with a lot of high-speed content, medium-speed, I think we can be strong anywhere else. And yeah, it's been a good weekend. Yeah, it started really well yesterday and today we had a good start. Unfortunately, I think we got caught out with the increase of temperature and I think with the balance, we just couldn't get on top of that in the first stint, which meant that the degradation was a little bit higher and with Lando having two sets of Hards it just compromised a little bit our race more than I wanted to. but I think already on the second stint things were a lot back under control, We were able to get a better read to the balance. And I think by the time we got to the third stint, things were a lot better. Yeah, it just turned out to happen both at the same time. Spending time around one of the slowest cars, given the degradation they were having, it was quite penalising. So I was just going for it. And it happened at 130R both times. No, it's good fun. It's good fun to go around there with two cars. It's a bit of a similar track, I'll say, with a lot of high-speed, medium-speed content. I think if we are able to be fast around this place, we can be fast in many other races, so it should be a good track for us as well. Yeah, I just hope that there are no issues with the track, with any drain holes, any issues like that. That will just put us out of sync. But I think for the show, probably it's good. It's a good thing. But I think from the preparation side, it's going to be definitely one that is going to be really hard because, I mean, I've never raced there, for example, with Red Bull so it's going to be quite a lot to do in a single practice. Yeah, I think we are all aware of the risk. But at the end of the day, it's our passion. We're here because it's our passion, our dreams. And yeah, we just don't think about it. We obviously have a lot of respect for each other on track. We know that we are travelling at extremely high top speeds. And yeah, when you see a shunt like it happened today with Daniel and Alex, the first thing as a driver, as a colleague, is that you want to make sure that they're fine and then the show can continue. But yeah, it was a very sad day when that happened to Jules, obviously. Yeah, it was quite a tricky corner. A lot of people went out there today. And yeah, I just went in over the kerb and I was just hoping to don't pick up a damage because it's so easy with these floors to go off and have a damage. As far as I know, we don't have any. I just understeered wide and went over the kerb. Once you are at the top of the kerb, it's game over. You just have to let the car roll, go over it, because it's better to be over than on top of it. But, yeah, I obviously picked up a lot of dirt on my tyres, which took a lap or two to really clean up, and I lost a couple of seconds with that. I fully agree with Max. I think it's great to have a series that gives an opportunity to drivers that cannot be in Formula 1 or other series, just to have another series where they can earn their money, live from the passion. I think it's great to have that. I think as a category itself, we have to respect what they're focusing into. And I think they're doing a very good job with the series. So, yeah, well done. Your mom is like, ‘Yeah, keep racing. Don't stop. You can’t stop!’ Don't worry. My dad is into politics, so I think he's more in danger. Don't be concerned, guys.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was very, very nice. I think the critical bit was, of course, the start, to stay ahead. And after that, actually, the car just got better and better for me throughout the race. I don't know if it had to do, maybe, with the clouds coming in. But yeah, very nice. Everything just went really well. Pit stops went well. Strategy, I think, worked out well. Couldn't have been any better! Yeah, no, absolutely. You know it was a little hiccup of course the last race but very happy that we are here back on top. Great fans, in front of Honda as well, I mean, it's fantastic of course to win here. Yeah, it's going to be quite hectic anyway with the Sprint weekend. But then, of course, we haven't been there for a while. So, yeah, only one practice session to really get into it again. So I think it will be quite interesting. Yeah, I think it was a very, very good win. It took a few laps to settle in a bit with the car, but I think we made some good changes to the car before going into qualifying, which then helped, you know, today. So, yeah, basically after the first stint, some tiny adjustments were made to the car and that helped me then to feel even more comfortable and whenever I needed to go faster, I could. Whenever I needed to look after my tyres, I could. That's always a very nice feeling to have once you're driving. Medium tyres, Hard tyres… Possibly the Hard tyres felt a bit better, but overall, on both sides, I think we were very competitive. (Laughing) We had, well, not an argument, but he was like, ‘are you sure you want to do this?’ I'm like, ‘yeah, I'm pretty sure’. Turned out to be wrong. So he was right. But in a way, it also fires me up, because I'm like, OK, well, even I'm not entirely happy with the balance now, I'll still try to be as consistent as I can be without shouting back at him. But we have a great relationship. And yeah, it works well like that. Yeah, I was not happy up until basically qualifying, but then we did make some changes. And yeah, of course, I cannot go into detail what we did, but it did help today. And yeah, it made it a lot nicer to drive and a bit more under control. I mean, not a relief, it's just nice to win, and it's nice, of course, to win here in Japan. It's always an important race for us. You know, the fans, of course, we have a lot of support here, and it's great, you know, to win here in front of Honda, and basically have three cars in the points as well. So, yeah, of course, Melbourne felt like a bit of a hiccup but what we did today, that's what we want to do, and that's what we aim to do every single weekend. I mean, you always look at things that you can do better, but I think overall the biggest change is that we did change the car around and that then just gave me more grip. Lately, Toto has been really nice, saying a lot of nice things about me! No, I don't know. It's still a very long season. I don't want to think about the rest of the season too much. I really want to approach it race by race. I know there will be tracks coming up that might not be so favourable for us, but then, of course, when we do get to tracks where we know that we can be quick, we have to really take advantage of it and score the maximum amount of points as a team, and that's what we'll continue to try and do. And then, of course, I think we know that we get to tracks where maybe it's a bit more difficult we have to try and maximise that as well, where maybe other teams can win as well. Yeah, it's very smart to do that. I think it's not great, let's say like that, to do that. Because when you have been away from a track for quite a while, I think you never know what you're going to experience, right? So it would have been better to have a normal race weekend there. But on the other hand, it probably spices things up a bit more, and that's maybe what they would like to see. But yeah, purely from a driving perspective, performance perspective of the sport, I think it's not the smartest thing to do. But yeah, we'll see what we get there. I mean, I always loved driving there. So yeah, hopefully we can hit the ground running as well as we can, and hopefully we don't need to fine-tune too many things on the car. To be honest of course I prefer not to think about those things. I know of course that the sport can be dangerous but I can also take a shower and slip and break my neck you know. So you have to put it into context. But yeah, I mean F1, you know you achieve high top speeds and anything can happen, you know, a part can break on the car, brakes can fail, a crash, you can roll, you know, you can think about it a lot, but I think it's better not to think about it too much. But I think we're all experienced enough and aware that once we go for a move or when we go on the limit of a lap time, you know, that, yeah, a mistake or a crash is, of course, easily done. And of course, you try to avoid these kind of things. I think looking at the history so far, street circuits are in general a little bit more difficult for us. I do think that our car has improved a bit, you know, in the low speed. But of course, on a street circuit, it's not only low speed, it's drivability, it's kerb riding, riding over the bumps. So general ride of a car. So these things are still a little bit unknown at the moment of how well we have improved on that. So we have to wait and see. What I like about Formula E is that there are quite a lot of good drivers in there. You might have raced them in the past or you've seen them around, so the competition is very high. Of course, a couple of my friends are driving in there as well, so I always keep an eye on it. It's not a category I would like to drive in myself in the future. It was very cool to see the track in the city but then at the same time there was a proper jump in the track, so i don't even know who signed that off, he must have been drunk. But yeah it's a bit odd but I think from the driving and like the racing, they have… I always enjoy it because the talent in the series is very high and that's of course what I think also makes it more exciting to watch. Thanks. Yeah, I think in general, of course, everything is a little bit more difficult. When it gets warmer, you have a bit less grip. So I think the first few laps you’re really trying to adapt to that. So, yeah, I think overall it worked out, of course, well for us. But, yeah, it's always a bit more tricky when suddenly the whole weekend you've done a certain temperature and then suddenly it goes up a bit. Maybe your mom is happy that he does. She has a bit of free time! Yeah, I mean, my dad started rallying two, three years ago now, so when I see his onboards, I definitely think he is in more danger than me. Yeah, my dad normally likes to blame it on the pace notes. But yeah, I mean, rallying, I have a lot of respect for the people that do the rallying. I mean, it's really impressive. I think that is, for me personally, because of the trees and stuff… Here we are on a track normally with walls and stuff designed to withstand an impact and stuff. A tree normally doesn't really move. So, yeah, I think rallying is a bit more dangerous.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, very special. I already felt… I saw a lot of fans in front of the traffic lights, in front of my garage. Yeah, it's good to come back here. Very energetic and hopefully I can have a good race in front of them… In front of the cherry blossoms as well, you know, it's very beautiful. So, yeah, so far it's been a very good condition. I saw like a mini, mini, tiny myself, I don't know, with helmet, racing suit. Maybe myself, yeah! Maybe, yeah. Actually, the size wasn't like that big. Yeah, it's literally like me. So, very cute. Maybe I put something in a bag or, you know, something like that, a lucky charm. Yeah, so far it's very consistent for us. At the last three tracks, we are consistently performing well, around P10 and feeling confident. We had a bit of upgrades as well, so hopefully that works well, but it's probably more towards the other tracks these upgrades, so I'm not sure it will work massively well, but yeah, still feeling optimistic, and yeah, points will be the main target. Yeah, I love this track. Well, other than... Well, quite easy to get boring. Well, like, is there any other tracks, you know, like... Nah, I mean, not this track, but specifically. Like, my personality, I get really easy to get bored, OK. But this is... But, like, this track, I’ve driven, like a 1,000 laps, you know, more than... more than, yeah, 10,000 laps. Maybe. I don't know, 10,000 laps, but it's just... In F4, yes, yeah. It's actually 45 seconds difference, so it's a lot compared to Formula 4. Formula 4, less downforce, so it's just very sliding. Anyway, it's fun to drive. Never get bored here. Every lap is very fun to drive. And yeah, my favourite corners, I would say Turn 7, the fast right. Maybe I don't know much about this track, but anyway, Turn 8. Yes, that's it. First of all, very far away from Europe. And I think mainly you want to race in Europe in junior categories to get a Super Licence, I would say. And to be close as much as possible to the Formula 1 teams, to get attention, I would say, to get interest. Also, I would say a little bit different regulation. I don't know, Pierre, but in Europe and Japan, there's a bit of regulation difference in terms of like the age you can start single-seater. In Japan, you can start from 16 years old, from birth date. And I think in Europe, drivers, they can start from 14 years old. So there's a bit of... two years difference, and that creates that, you know, already kind of a late start. So that's why, and you have to go to Europe kind of to race and to compete against the Europe drivers, so that probably makes it a little bit difficult. And obviously, the language as well. Japanese don't speak as much good English, like me. So it's hard to communicate well and tell what you want specifically from the car set-up, for example. These things will take a little bit of time. And, you know, you want to have straightaway good confidence in F3 already because you have only one free practice and straight into qualifying. So those makes it, I think, difficult, yeah. I hope so. We've seen already a lot of Japanese drivers driving already in Formula 2. This as well is other Japanese drivers from actually different manufacturers, like Toyota. But yeah, I think it's good to see a lot of drivers start to challenge in the Europe races and to get our best opportunity as much as possible. But yeah, at the same time, yeah, it's good to see for sure. And hopefully we can see another driver.",Japan,thursday,RB
Max Verstappen,"Maybe it was yourself. How big? How big was it? The highlights so far with me and Honda or being here? Well, I guess winning races and championships together that for sure is my highlight with Honda and just being able to work with their with their people, you know. Yeah, a lot of yeah great things that we have done already and things to come. For me, being here in Japan is always very nice. Did a bit of skiing as well. I've been around already for a couple of days. It's always good to be back here. Actually, I think I enjoyed even more around this time of the year, early on in the year. When you're traveling quite far, Australia, and then when you can go straight to Japan, I think it works out quite well. Every year is different, but also, you know, last year we had a bit of a difficult weekend in Singapore. I think if you look at Melbourne performance-wise, I think we were quick, but we didn't finish the race. So that's not ideal, but our car normally likes you know the higher speed corners, so hopefully that you know we can show that again this weekend. Yeah, we'll discuss it in the driver's briefing. Yeah, I think we saw already some signs on Saturday where things were maybe not looking like they should have done. Of course, then now in hindsight, yeah, you can say that it was coming from the brake caliper. But yeah, we couldn't find any, let's say, fault with the car, which in a way, I mean, it's of course always bad to retire, but of course when you have a fault in maybe the build spec or whatever, then it's a bit worse. So yeah, we'll just move on from there and learn from it that it doesn't happen again, but normally it shouldn't. No, no. Well, I mean... We have a lot of people working on the car, right? So it's a whole team effort that has to come together. And everyone's ideas, they get taken into account when you build the car that we have today. So yeah, for sure, having someone part of the team like Adrian, I think is a massive boost for everyone. And yeah, many people, they work together to achieve the car we have today. I do like to drive them. To be honest, I do prefer the older cars to drive because they're a bit lighter, a bit more agile. But I'll drive whatever the rules are, right? Did you brake test him there or not? Yeah, no, honestly, like the relationship has always been really, really good. And of course, you know, moments that you never forget. For me, like the first podium already, to see the happiness in everyone's faces, you know, after, you know, a few difficult years for me that was really special to witness. And then, of course, the first win. Yeah, it's just all these moments that you have lived through and, you know, the championship, you know, Yeah, I will always remember them. And also, you know, the very bright people that you're working with as well. And also, like Pierre said before, you know, their culture. You have a lot of respect for how they approach things. And yeah, it's been really, really nice to be able to work with them. Of course, at one point, our relationship will end in terms of working with the team but that doesn't mean that you know that's that. I  mean, there's a lot more to it and for sure for me I'll always be a big Honda fan but yeah, let's see, a lot of great memories. and yeah apart from the other engine manufacturers I mean they're all great in their own way. but of course naturally I think I've had a bit more history now with with Honda. Yeah, I think it's those days where you don't really want to think about too much. Personally, of course, I didn't really know Jules that well, but of course, we all have friends in common that did. He was, of course, incredibly talented. And yeah, for sure, he would have achieved incredible things in Formula 1. I think everyone was pretty sure about that. But yeah, that was, I think, a very bad day for everyone, the sport, of course. But I think we also, again, learned a lot about safety that day. Unfortunately, it seems like, you know, sometimes these kind of things need to happen for safety to improve. And it's, of course, not what you like to see, but that's how it seems to work in life. But yeah, I do find it nice as well that he will always be remembered. There are things in his name, charities, like the go-kart races his dad also still organises to always remember his name because he definitely deserves that. Luckily, we've got 24 races a year. In F4? Then it gets boring, yes. Yeah, it's definitely one of my favourites. It's quite intimidating, I think, the first time you actually drive around the track. That's how I found it. It probably doesn't help. It was also the first time you drive a proper F1 car around here. Yeah, it's a lot of fun when the car is also really hooked up. If you have a car that is not really well balanced in the first sector, it makes it really, really challenging. But a car that is just very stable gives you a lot of confidence and then you can really push sector one, which for me is the best part of the track. But yeah, even in the wet, Because it's so narrow, if you make a small mistake, you can go off in the grass or gravel. It just adds a bit more to it than some other tracks where you can run wide, you take the tarmac and you can come back on track. So you definitely need to be really aware. If you maybe push a bit more, you risk a bit more that you can really go off and crash the car. So yeah, that makes it very special for me. Who was that? No, it all depends on if I want to also drive next year or not, you know. But from my side, no, I'm very happy where I'm at. And, yeah, we want to keep it that way. I mean, I think we'll have to deal with some compromises on some tracks, you know, where you use a lot of energy per lap. And of course, you know, with the potential like active aero and stuff. I'm not sure if we should head into that direction. That's what it's looking like at the moment. Hopefully, we can optimise all these kind of things. For me, it's more important to just try and fight the weight of the cars, try and optimise that instead of all these tools and tricks to try and help the overtaking or following. There must be different ways to be able to do it. I guess, also, with the engine regulation that they went into, they kind of need to do that to create the top speed and basically you know where the battery stops deploying and stuff. And yeah some tracks will work a bit better some tracks probably it's a bit more on the edge. Of course people will try to counter my arguments but I guess we'll find out anyway and in ‘26, but also I'm not really thinking, of course, too much about it because we have a lot of work in the seasons up until ‘26. But we'll see if we can improve it a bit. I don't know. It doesn't mean necessarily ‘26 or whatever, right? I mean, I have a contract with Red Bull until ‘28. After that, I first want to see if I actually even want to continue. That's for me the most important. It's not so much about where. So these kind of things I don't really think about at the moment.",Japan,thursday,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"You just saw yourself in the mirror. Yeah, I think so, yeah. I've been riding my bike this week. I stayed in Australia for a week and started going back to the gym. Still obviously not lifting heavy numbers like I used to do in the past, but at least I can get my training done and I'm feeling back to 100%, yeah. I will see. I think it's important, like I always say in the past, to turn the page quickly – in the good and in the bad. I think obviously coming from a good it’s more difficult to turn the page because you want to stay enjoying the moment, but I turned it on Monday, started focusing my training and being back as fit as possible for Japan. Also, because it's going to be a challenging track for us. I think last year was one of our most challenging ones in reference to a Red Bull. We were, I think, seven or eight tenths off four or five months ago here. So it's time to see where we are this year and see if we can be at least closer and enjoy a bit more this amazing track than what we enjoyed it last year, because for me, it's one of my favourite ones, if not my favourite. Yeah, good, thank you. I mean, talking obviously to a few because that's what my management team and myself should do when I don't have a job for next year yet. So, yeah, talking, we're talking to pretty much all of them. It's just a matter of obviously going more into detail and seeing the more realistic options and what are the best options for me and for my future, which I don't have any news for you or nothing to say here today. The only thing I would say is that, yeah, obviously it's time now to speed up a bit everything and hopefully we can get it sorted sooner rather than later. Nothing to add. I just think, apart from all that, I think that corner needs to be reviewed, which is already something I said in the last driver's briefing, but it's not the first time that after a collision, the car comes back into the track and it's a corner that we're doing 250 kph and it's blind. I just don't like the last few incidents that we've seen in this corner, also in other categories. It just doesn't give me a very good feeling. It's a great corner, don't get me wrong. I love driving in a qualifying lap. It's just... When it comes to racing, there's been just too many examples of a car coming back onto a track and being very narrow there. And I just think it's a corner that needs to be a bit reviewed. Yeah, thank you. I think it's true to say that in Australia, we look very strong, but I think normally in these cases, you just need to get the average of the first three races. And I think the average is we're still a couple of tenths of the Red Bull and we need probably an upgrade, especially in tracks like Suzuka to fight them. I think the job that the team has done this year is extremely good because the car is a very good step forward. It's just we need more of the same, you know, if we want to go for the wins in tracks like maybe Japan, no? There is no big upgrade coming here. We have, I think, a very small thing in the car, at the rear. But it will come later in the season. And I hope that is another good step in the same direction. That’s Turn 8. I have very little to say after that, but one of my favourite tracks for sure. The narrowness makes it challenging. The fact that if you put a wheel of the track, it's grass or gravel and penalises the driver. And then the feeling of speed that we have here is, I would say, similar to a track like Imola, for example, that the feeling of speed is narrow and it's crazy, and that's what gives the driver the thrill. Yeah, I think it's all a consequence, as Mark said, of the engine regulations. In the end, if you have a lot more energy requested from the electric powertrain, you're going to need to have, in a way, active aerodynamics to compensate. And there is where it all starts to get messy with the overtaking and the active aero and how you can do that to help the car to go quicker on the straight and spend less time full throttle. Anyway, until we don't try them, it's I think unfair to criticise or to back the regulation change. At the same time, if it has attracted manufacturers, big manufacturers like Audi, into the sport, I think it's something that it has to be appreciated and put into context. My personal view is that these cars now are probably just too big and too heavy. If I would have to change something for tomorrow, it would be that. And then the suspension, I think the suspensions are becoming a big talking point in a lot of the tracks and how we brought them into some corners and how taxing it can be for the driver. And so if I would have to request something to the FIA for 2026, if we are going to have active aero, why not active suspension to protect the back of the drivers and to protect our own health and the safety of certain tracks. because it's clear that right now we are asking way too many things to the tracks and to the circuits, to the organisations, to change many small bumps that before we wouldn't even feel with the ‘21 car, and now we just can spin or have a pretty big accident because of those situations. So if I would have to ask or add one thing for the ‘26 would be something to protect us a bit on that front.",Japan,thursday,Ferrari
Alex Albon,"No, not at all. I think we've been like that since Bahrain and it doesn't really change anything. So for us, obviously, it will be this weekend and China that we don't have a spare car. But as I said, the mindset's the same as it was from race one. I think it was more degrading that caught us out, obviously, with the limited track time. We would have most probably done things a little bit different come Sunday. What we've seen so far, actually, is the car's been behaving pretty well over the races, better than last year, race one, race two. I think Melbourne was maybe a little bit more like it was last year, but... I think we've made a step in race pace generally. So hopefully more of the same here this weekend. I'd say, firstly, strangely, it's on the narrow side. The immersion of speed when it's narrow just feels more. The precision has to be more as well. For the most part, they've kept a lot of their kerbs original. So not kind of going towards the… I mean, it's changing a little bit, but it for the most part stayed true to the character of the track. There's undulations, cambers, all things which race tracks have and city tracks don't really have anymore. And also, it's just uncompromising. There's really not much run-off. It's white lines and grass. So you enjoy that as a driver to be able to feel that adrenaline when you're driving and to know that to go quicker, you need to put a bit more on the line. That's always quite fun. What?! I think George mentioned it before, and Carlos, the exit kerb and the way that it's angled to the wall, it tends to force drivers back onto the racing line. That's one thing. It's not a new thing. It happened last year. Exactly! I didn't want to say, but there we go. And it was brought up, but obviously maybe it's down to the park or whatever. It wasn't changed. And there's also the kerb. There's kind of a double-stepped kerb on the exit, and especially as we have these low cars now, everything we touch, we can use the first bit of kerb, but if you go too far across and you hit the second kind of ramp section, it forces the car into the air, so there's two things that could be done better.",Japan,thursday,Williams
George Russell,"I'm feeling all good. It's still obviously early days in the season. I think there's a clear trend, where we know our strengths in the car, our weaknesses. Definitely performing stronger in the low-speed corners, struggling a bit in the high-speed corners, of which there's more of in Jeddah, more of in Melbourne, more of in Suzuka, you know, these are the faster circuits of the season. There's still plenty to understand. So as I said, still early days, we know we're not where we want to be, but everybody's working really hard to, you know, improve the correlation, get a bit closer to what we're seeing at the factory on the simulator and find some performance. I think every time you're back, you are understanding things further. There's never going to be a silver bullet for any team. You're chipping away at it. You want to find big breakthroughs. You want to find big gains. It's rare that these happen these days in Formula 1. The level is so, so high. Everybody's moving forward, but we're confident that we're going to make another step in the right direction. Will it be enough is another question, but as we said, it's still early days in the season. Yeah, I think it was... Obviously a bit of a strange situation that happened last week. As I said at the time, totally caught by surprise. I was actually looking at the steering wheel, making a switch change in the straight, which, you know, we all do across the lap. And when I looked up, I was in Fernando's gearbox and it was sort of too late. And then next thing I know I'm in the wall. So I think, if it were not to have been penalised, it would have really opened the kind of worms for the rest of the season – and in junior categories – of saying, you know, are you allowed to break in a straight? Are you allowed to slow down, change gear, accelerate, do something semi-erratic? I don't take anything personally with what happened with Fernando. And it probably had bigger consequences than it should have. But as I said, if it went unpenalised, can you just break in the middle of a straight? I don't know. So, yeah, nothing more to say really. Yeah, I mean, we actually saw each other back home, just coincidentally bumped into each other in a coffee shop… No, as I said before, it's nothing personal. When the helmet's on, we're all fighters and competing. And when the helmet's off, you have respect for one another. So, of course, a lot of emotions in the moment. But, you know, we both moved forward from this. No, we didn't. He didn't get my coffee, though, that was probably the least that could have happened. But, no, it's history now. I mean, it was an incredibly uncomfortable position to be in, you know, your... on a blind bend, 250 kilometres an hour, right on the racing line with the car half upside down, you know, waiting for disaster to happen. You know, fortunately I had a 10-second gap behind me and I think it was 10 or 12 seconds before the Safety Car came out. But in the space of 10 seconds, you can have five, six, seven cars if that was on lap one of the race and probably been hit numerous times, even with the yellow flag. Yeah, I mean, we've seen close incidents before where a car comes back, Carlos in ‘22 in Japan. I think we need to find a way that if a car is in a danger zone, automated, you know, VSC straight away, you know, within, you know, half a second or so because those seconds count. And, you know, lives are at risk. We've seen it, you know, spar numerous times in the past, cars, aquaplaning. Yeah, I think it's time with the technology that we have to make steps in this area. Yeah, I mean, I agree with all the guys, but I think the undulations as well and the cambered corners make it really nice. I think all the circuits that we have, undulations – Portimão, Austin – that's really fun to drive. And then corners that they're banked into the apex, is really nice. Some of the circuits we have off-cambered corners, which all drivers hate, and it's difficult to race. You can't do different lines. So I think that combination of cambered corners and the ups and downs makes it pretty special. The corner's amazing, probably one of the best corners on that circuit, so I wouldn't want to see that corner change, but it is true. If you hit that wall, you just bounce back into the track. So, you know, it's not just that corner. I think all... all circuits that have the barriers in certain positions, if it's going to propel you back onto the circuit, that's obviously not good. And we don't want to have big runoffs. We don't want to have tarmac runoffs. You know, I think everything is correct. Just the position of that wall, even if it's, you know, closer to the track, but in line with the circuit, at least you wouldn't bounce off into the racing line. Thanks. Yeah, what you say is absolutely correct. Every driver is open to change their line, brake earlier, power through the corner, do whatever. When we start braking in the middle of a straight, downshifting, accelerating, upshifting again, then braking again for a corner, I think that goes beyond the realms of adjusting your line. And as I said, I was actually looking at my steering wheel in that straight as I've done every single lap prior. And when I looked up a hundred metres before the corner, I realised I was right behind Fernando rather than the half a second that I was. You know, we've got so many duties to take care of. when we're driving, you know, looking, going around the racetrack, changing all of the settings on the steering wheel, making sure you're in the right engine mode, taking care of the tyres, talking to your engineer, managing the deltas on your steering wheel when it's an in-lap, out-lap, safety car, whatever it may be. If you add into the mix, you're allowed to brake in the middle of the straight to gain a tactical, or get a tactical advantage. I think that is maybe one step too far. And the same when we talk about moving down the straight to get out of the slipstream. There was lots of talks about that in the past. It's not overly dangerous, but it has a concertina effect if everybody's moving around. And if suddenly if you brake test somebody and there's 10 cars behind, it probably has a greater effect by the 10th driver than it does for the first driver behind. So as I said, I don't think what Fernando did was extraordinarily dangerous, but it will open a can of worms if it wasn't penalised. Yeah, I mean, Sebastian's a great person and he's a four-time world champion and for sure his personality is missed on the grid and I think it's important that we have the best 20 drivers in the world all competing for race wins and championships. So, as I said before... I'm really happy and open to have anybody as my teammate, you know, whether it's world champion, whether it's a rookie, it doesn't change how I go about my business. And yeah, as I said, we'll welcome anybody.",Japan,thursday,Mercedes
Pierre Gasly,"Well, that's nice to have this first upgrade on the car. It was planned already before the season started, so it's sort of, you know, following the sort of development plan that we had already in place. We don't expect it to be major. We know it's not going to, you know, bring us where we want to be, but it's a first step in the right direction, so definitely looking forward to see what it brings. I don't want to give any specific targets. We know it should be a small step of performance on the car, which we obviously need from where we are today. But, you know, it's... We need more and will need more, but definitely it's positive to see that these first upgrades are coming on the car and more should follow in the next few months. Well, I think we get to see it already from the moment we get to the airport or train station or even on a Thursday on a racetrack. I think this place is very unique. You've got fans, spectators in the grandstand already on a Thursday just appreciating the work from the mechanics, you know, building the car, putting all the parts together. And their passion is just unbelievable. You know, they're really showing their support in a very unique way. Usually when I come here, I understood straight away when I came from Super Formula, you’ve got to come here with a half-empty luggage because you leave that place with hundreds of toys and gifts that you receive from the fans. It's personally a country I love from their values, their respect. Very different to Europe and what you see back home. So it's definitely unique. And the track itself is one of the fastest in the calendar. It really makes you feel the power and the downfalls of a Formula 1 car. So it's definitely top of my list. Yeah, I mean, I agree with Max. I think definitely Jules will always be remembered for who he was, I think, obviously as a driver, but also just as a human being. He was extremely kind. Yeah, it was an example for a lot of drivers, but especially in France. I remember when we were in the French team, all young drivers with Antoine, Esteban, and many other young kids that we obviously looked up to him as the next big thing in Formula 1 because everyone, I think, agrees that he would eventually make it to Ferrari. So, yeah, it's definitely very, very sad, you know, to remember what's happened. And I'm glad, you know, I think he left, definitely, his mark in Formula 1 and also beyond it. And it will definitely be always remembered. Same as Yuki. I don't get bored here. It's a very entertaining track. I agree with all the guys. It's definitely one of the best of the season. I think Yuki explained it very well. I think it's, you know, mainly all the categories are in Europe, when you're based in Japan, we see more Japanese drivers coming over to Europe, racing in Formula 3, Formula 2. When you look back, you still had, you know, Takuma Sato, [Kazuki] Nakajima, Yuki. You could say the same thing about American drivers, which is, you know, a massive country, and still we haven't had many Americans here in Formula 1. So I think it's... you know, some of it is just that mainly all the racing is in Europe and going up the ladder, you need to be here to be exactly for the reasons that Yuki mentioned earlier.",Japan,thursday,Alpine
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, thank you. Thanks very much. It was a really good race. I felt really good out there. Of course, a bit stiff and especially physically. It wasn't the easiest, but I was lucky that I was more or less on my own and I could manage my pace, manage the tyres, manage everything. And it wasn't the toughest race of all. But yeah, very happy, very proud of the team. Happy to be in a 1-2 with Charles here. It shows that the hard work pays off. And yeah, life sometimes is crazy, you know. What happened at the beginning of the year, then the podium in Bahrain, then the appendix, the comeback, the win. It's a roller coaster, but I loved it, and yeah, I'm extremely happy. I think I will recommend all the drivers to take it out this winter! I don't know. I felt like I could keep up with him on the first lap and try and take DRS, just to make sure that… DRS around here is super powerful. Then he lost the car into Turns 3 and there was my chance to get close and attempt an overtake. And then as soon as he was behind, I think he started struggling with the brakes and that was it for him. A pity because we would have had, I think, a very good fight for P1 today. But, you know, I'm happy to take the win. He's had plenty of them. So, yeah, happy to be back here. I think from lap two, when I was leading, I said with the pace I had yesterday, I knew I could get it done, especially in clean air, manage the tyres. I could get it done. Then obviously the risk of Safety Car and red flag here was always in the back of my mind. But luckily it was a clean race and not too much happened. Obviously, sorry for George there at the end. It looked like a big one. I hope he's OK. And yeah, I could finish the race, win it, bring it home. A great feeling. Yeah, thank you very much. But yeah, and I think it's not only the last two weeks. It's the whole start to the year in general, how the year started with the news of the non-renewal. Then you get yourself fit. You get yourself ready for the start of the season, pushing flat out. And then you get to Bahrain. You do a good podium. You say, ‘OK, now the season is starting well and I can keep the momentum going’. And suddenly, boom, they're missing a race in Jeddah and the operation. Long days in bed, not knowing if I was going to be back in time. Obviously, a lot of unknowns. Am I going to be back fit? Am I going to be back feeling still good with the car? And then suddenly you come back and win. So, yes, what I said on the radio – life is a roller coaster sometimes, but it can be really nice and good to you sometimes. Just letting it sink in and enjoying the moment. How nervous I was? I was confident about the first half of the race that I was going to be OK because it's more or less the laps that I did on Friday. Obviously, the second half of the race was a bit of an unknown. But yeah, once I got up in front and I had a gap, you can manage everything. You can manage yourself, you can manage the tyres, you have less pressure. You can choose your places where to push and not to push you know, and everything becomes a lot easier. So yeah, I'm not going to lie, the last five or 10 laps I was a bit stiff and tired but nothing that was slowing me down too much. Yeah, I got a decent start from the dirty side of the grid, but obviously couldn't put Max under pressure into Turn 1, but from there on it was a kind of a very strategic first lap and a half where you are wanting to protect the tyre from opening up the graining. But at the same time, I knew this weekend and this race, I could have the pace to challenge Max. And I thought to myself, with how powerful the DRS is around here, if I get myself within the DRS range after lap one, we can put him a bit under pressure. I think he did a mistake into Turn 3 that allowed me to stay within the DRS and I could feel myself being pretty quick. And then, yeah, I don't know when his brakes started to go, but yeah, in dirty air, obviously, it's not the same than in clean air with a big gap. I don't know. I saw him... obviously pushing on lap one and I was like, ‘OK, I'm going to push with him too and challenge in the car’. But obviously it could have been the brakes, as he said. So, yeah, I don't know, honestly, but it felt good to pass him, with brake issues or not, because it is tough, you know, to pass Max on track and the Red Bull, But it's what we've said from the beginning – if you are there and you can put Red Bull under pressure, you can sometimes get it done. But you need to be there, and we need to be there more often if we want to win. I think our car really worked really well this weekend. But I think it's going to be tough to keep it up there in every track until we bring an upgrade to close that gap that we saw in Bahrain and Jeddah. But around Australia, from lap one, it felt like a race-winning car. And even if Red Bull were also quick and were on pole, that 59 in quali wasn't out of reach for us. And I think we just… Yeah, there will be tracks where we are strong like we saw last year. And this year it seems like our race pace is better even on those tracks that we are stronger. And together with a good development programme, I hope that we can challenge Red Bull more often. Yeah, I guess my body is still a bit in protection mode. So everything I do is a bit more slow and a bit more cautious because obviously when they go through your abdominal, it is a weird feeling, as I said. But it's what I said at the beginning of the weekend, without pain, even if I'm a bit in protection mode, I can drive no problem. Physically, what I felt towards the end of the race… Just very stiff. Obviously, spending seven days in bed is, for your physical fitness and for all the muscles, it's just not very healthy for an athlete. But as I said, only the last stint, I would say, I was a bit more stiff. Until the last stint, I was perfectly fine. Still with this weird feeling, but nothing that was slowing me down at all. I was confident with the car and pushing. Yeah, it's unbelievable. The support that we get in countries like Australia, you know, from the tifosi, it's something really, really special. Yeah, it's just so many fans out there wearing red. It almost looks like you're in Monza, you know, at some points on the track. And it's really nice to see, and obviously all this makes a difference for us, for the team, having all this support and going to places where we feel so loved and supported. It's always a really nice feeling for the drivers, but also for the mechanics and all the team members. Yeah, I just, as soon as I got my appendix removed, I went on the internet and started talking with professionals and said, ‘OK, what helps to speed up recovery?’ And obviously from that point onwards, I started doing all the sort of things that you can do to speed up recovery, the wounds, the scar tissue, what you can help to be faster on that, talking to other athletes, talking to other doctors in Spain, internationally. And then I put together a plan with my team. The reason why athletes recover faster is because you can dedicate 24 hours per day for seven days to recovery. And that's exactly what I did. I started going to hyperbaric chambers twice a day for one hour, taking an Indiba machine, that is electromagnetic thing for the wounds. I was programming my time in bed, my time to go for a walk, my time to eat, the kind of food that you have to recover. Just everything is centered around recovery to try to be ready for Australia. Now, you ask me, nine days ago, when I was about to catch the flight to come to Australia, I was still in bed. Barely I could use my abdominal to move. And I was like, this is not going to happen. But I took the flight, and suddenly when I landed in Australia, the feeling was a lot better. And every 24 hours, I was making a lot more progress than the first seven days, which is actually what all the doctors and all the professional people told me. Don't worry, because the second week, every day is going to improve a lot more than the first week. And even Alex Albon told me this, I remember. So it just followed more or less what everyone told me and put together a good plan. I don't know. For sure, it does no harm. That is 100%. But yeah, I'm still without a job for next year. So I guess this is going to help it. And yeah, I don't know. I think everyone knows more or less what I'm capable of doing. I do race for myself. I race to keep proving to myself that I can win whenever I get a competitive car and whenever there's an opportunity to win in a weekend. I don't race to prove to team principals or to prove to people my value. I race to prove to myself that if I'm given a car, I can get it done and I can be up there, you know, and that's the mentality and the approach that I have and I will keep having the rest of the year. I don't know what to say. I guess I agree here with my two favourite team-mates! There are some kind words there, but I agree with them. I think people that know me or have shared a team with me or people that have worked with me, know me and I don't feel underrated by people that know about this sport. Then other people that maybe don't have an insight and don't know as much about this sport, if they want to underrate me, I'm fine with that. I don't care honestly, but I care about the people that know the sport well and about my team-mates, the people that have seen my data, seen how I work, seen my speed, and that's the thing I care about, and I don't feel underrated by them.",Australia,post-race,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it feels good mostly for the team, of course. I mean, first and second didn't happen since Bahrain 2022, which are very good memories we have. And it's amazing to be able to do that. Carlos has had an incredible weekend to come back after his surgery. He's done an amazing race. On my side, I struggled a bit more in the second stint with the first Hard. There, I don't know, I didn't manage the tyres well. But then the last stint was more positive. But first and second was the best we could do. Not really, because in the first stint, we had to protect behind, so we had to stop a bit earlier, and then from that moment onwards, Carlos was very fast, and with my tyres, I was struggling. I think that as soon as we stopped at the first stop, then for me it was clear. But again, Carlos has done a better job all weekend. So, I mean, at least from qualifying to the race, and he definitely deserves that victory. So I'm really happy for him. I'm really happy for the team. It's really good points. We came into the weekend telling ourselves that we need to maximize our points, and there's nothing we could have done better. So really happy about this. Thank you very much. Oh, it's extremely important, because it's been a long time since we have had the genuine pace to have Red Bull... I wouldn't say under control, because we don't know what was the real pace of Max today, but I will say that from FP1, we knew that pole position and the race win was possible because we had very good tyre degradation, very good pace, and that is a very encouraging sign. However, if you look at the first three races, two out of the first three races they had the upper hand in the race. So we still have a lot of work to do. But that's exactly what we need to do as a team. Whenever we have the opportunity to actually win a race we need to take it and this weekend we did it, Carlos did it today. On my side, second with the fastest lap, so there are not any more points that we have got. And looking back at the first three races, there is not one race where we didn't maximise the result. So we need to do that until we get the car that is consistently better than the Red Bull, especially in the race. Just being better. I think in qualifying yesterday, I haven't been good enough. In the second stint today, on the first Hard stint, I had quite a bit of graining on the front left after the [Virtual] Safety Car. The last stint was really good, but it wasn't enough. So Carlos has just been better this weekend. But it’s been that in the last three years, where we basically will arrive at one race and Carlos will be better and then I'll push and then I'll be better at the next race and then we'll improve like that. And that's very exciting as a driver to have such a fast team-mate. And he's really been on it since the beginning of the weekend. So congratulations to Carlos. I mean, it's been crazy the whole weekend. The fan zone was probably one of the loudest fan zones we ever had. And we can really feel a very special support here in Melbourne. Lots of Italian people, as you said, and we can feel that special support. So it's good to have such a great result on such a track and with having so much support around the track. I think everybody knows Carlos' worth in the paddock. He's one of the highest-rated drivers in the paddock. And he's been extremely strong every time he was in a Formula 1 car. And he has showed it multiple times. So I don't think he's underrated for that. I think everybody knows Carlos' worth. And that's why I've said many times that I'm not too worried about his future, because I'm sure that many, many team principals are… He doesn't say it, but for sure they are speaking with him! And I'm sure he will have many opportunities and he'll just have to make the best choice for his career.",Australia,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"No, it was a very good day for us. I'm very happy, proud of the team. P3 and P4 is a lot of points in the championship, so that's the first thing. We missed out on Charles. I think our pace was a little bit better. He undercut us in the first stint, so maybe a little bit of hope for second place. I think our pace was strong enough today. But Ferrari and Carlos did a very good job, so hats off to them. They've been fast all weekend. I felt good. I felt like I could manage the tyres very well today, and that was a good step. Probably wasn't expecting to be on the podium, so I'm very happy. Yes. I mean, it's clear that this circuit suits us a little bit more. So we've been able to push and unlock a little bit of speed. But it's still another step to Ferrari and Red Bull, they're one or two steps ahead of us still, so we need to catch up. But it's clear that we're getting closer and a day like today proves exactly that. So, a big thanks to all in McLaren. We're getting closer to our target. It's nice to be back on the podium again and hopefully we can have many more. I think when you take the Red Bull out of it I would say, no. I think our pace has been good all weekend. We put things together very nicely yesterday. We showed a good long run and high-fuel pace on Friday. So I wouldn't have said we had no chance. I didn't expect probably us to be competing against the Ferraris today. I think our pace was not as good as Carlos, but probably better than Charles. So I think if I was being honest we maybe missed out a little bit on an opportunity to be P2 today. But yeah, for us to say that is a good sign. And I think it's a good positive for the whole team. It's a good boost. It's nice to be back on the podium. Whether or not the Red Bull was there or not our pace was good today and hopefully that continues for more races. I mean, we didn't leave anything on the table but yeah the lap we were going to undercut, he boxed. So then again you have to go off and do kind of a different strategy. We got close in the second stint. I got very close. If I boxed, I think I would have undercut. But he boxed, so I missed that opportunity. So you always think, what happens if we did it one lap earlier? But it's tough to make all those decisions at the time. And it can easily go wrong at the same time. There are always consequences of doing so. I think we still did a very good job today. Third and fourth for us, as a team, is positive and a good load of points. But they were clearly a better team, and they have a better car at the minute. So whether or not we could beat them, they have a better car, they have a quicker car, and we have to work harder until we can match what they're doing. Not really. I think if you look back to here last year we were not terrible considering the car that we had. We've now come back with a good car and we've shown what we can do but I think this was always going to be a good weekend for us. Suzuka proved that last year. I think they're kind of similar. You’ve got a lot of high speed. The problem is Ferrari have improved their high speed a lot and that's where they were struggling last year. So that's why they've been able to take such a good step forward. I think we can still have a good weekend. We can still look forward to it. And I would love to say that if we can get two cars on a podium again, it would be a lovely weekend. But I think we have two more cars this year that we're competing against on these types of circuits, not just Max. I think Charles put it well, to be honest. If anyone thinks he's... Yeah, there's no reason anyone should think he's underrated. I think for the people who know him, know what he's capable of doing, know his effort level, his approach and dedication to wanting to be one of the best, exactly like he's proved today, and over the last couple of weeks. I'm sure you have plenty of drivers who probably wouldn't have tried as hard and dedicated so much of their time and effort to trying to recover and get back in the race car. And I think that's just one example of it. But for the people who know what he's capable of doing, you would never ever say he's underrated. And yeah, of course, results are always a bit of a point to show and people on the outside just easily judge things from what you see on TV. But when you've worked with him, when you know what he's capable of doing, and when things click, they click very well and he has performances like he does this weekend. And I would say all year, he's proved to be a step up from maybe what he has been last year. Yeah, you're silly if you underrate him. It depends how you look at it. I was a lot quicker, and I would have overtaken him anyway. It's just you don't want to delay the process of that happening. And the longer I kind of spent behind him, the worse it was making my chance of catching Charles and trying to be ahead of Charles. So yeah, I don't think the result changed at all. He made my life easier and I think he helped us as a team which I thank him for a lot and we have a lot of respect for one another in these kind of situations. But I don't think the result changed at all. But yeah, for any driver who's racing in front of their home fans, you want to be on the podium. So I don't think, yeah, I would ever take anything away from that or for what Oscar has provided and helped for in the team. But I don't think the end result changed, no matter what.",Australia,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a bit unexpected, I think, today in qualifying, but very happy with Q3. I think both of those laps, they felt really, really nice, and that was very enjoyable. But, yeah, it was a bit of a tricky weekend so far, but, yeah, we managed to be there at the end, so I'm very happy with that. Yeah, they seem very quick also in the long run. So a bit of a question mark for tomorrow, but I guess that makes it very exciting. So we'll find out tomorrow. Yeah, I'm very happy with that. I think so far this weekend it's been a bit tough to find a good balance in the car. And even throughout qualifying, Q1, Q2, I didn't really feel like fighting for pole. But then we made some little tickles on the car and that seemed to help me in Q3 to really push it to the limit. And both of my laps I felt quite happy with it. I mean, there are always things that you can improve, but overall, yeah, very satisfied with the performance. No, I mean more to come. I tried to do the best I could. I mean I think if you go corner after corner, yeah maybe there are a few things that you can do better but it is always you know when you're under pressure flat out around this track it's very hard to nail every single corner, like on any other track. But in general of course very pleased with the laps that we did Not really. I mean, we did quite a bit, even this morning. So from that side, I don't think so. It's just that it was a bit harder to find a good balance in the car. So we'll find out tomorrow if it's going to be good enough in the race because it looks like Ferrari is also very fast and quite comfortable the whole weekend already. So, yeah, hopefully it will be an interesting race tomorrow. Yeah, maybe it's because we were not on top of things, but they looked well dialled in, let's say, like that from the start. And probably from our side, it was a bit the opposite way. And yeah, we managed to improve it. But the race is going to be quite tough with the softer compounds that we have this year. So yeah, we'll find out tomorrow. Yeah, quite a bit more than I would have liked, of course. And the same in qualifying. I think Q1 and Q2 was still quite difficult for me. But yeah, we just tried to fine-tune little things that we could throughout qualifying, and they made that little difference to push a bit harder. The track was also a bit warmer compared to FP3. So naturally, the track is also a bit slower to start with. Probably also with all the other categories driving, it takes a few laps before our rubber is put down again fully. And that then gives you a bit more grip, I guess. Why? A win is a win. It doesn't matter, right? But it was just a bit messy last year with too many red flags. So let's just hope that that is not the case this year and that we can have a good race in general because I think the fans, they deserve that. It's always a great race to be at. And yeah, I do think that it can be an interesting race tomorrow.",Australia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, thanks a lot. It's been a tough couple of weeks, you know, a lot of days in bed, waiting for this moment, to see if I could be here today and, yeah, to make it to this weekend and then obviously to put it on the front row after leading through qualifying, I was almost not believing it, especially after how tough it's been. But very happy to be here, very happy to be challenging the Red Bulls this weekend. I was a bit rusty at the beginning yesterday, but then I got up to speed and I could finally find the pace and feeling good with the car. I'm not going to lie. I'm not in my most comfortable state when I'm driving out there, but I can get it done. And as far as I can get it done without the pain... Obviously, a lot of discomfort and weird feelings, but no pain, so it allows me to push flat out. Cheers. Thank you. Yeah, it feels OK. I mean, as I said at the beginning of the weekend, I don't feel 100%. I think it's impossible to feel 100% after spending seven to 10 days in bed like I did just trying to recover. But the good thing, you know, is that I had no pain. I just have the discomfort, and obviously everything feels a bit weird inside, but I can push. Especially today, I could push flat out. Yesterday, I took it easy at the beginning, Had to do some tweaks to the seat, to the belts, to the brake pedal. But today, you know, when the adrenaline came up in quali and I could close the visor and go for it, I could go for it, which is a good thing. So yeah, hopefully tomorrow I still do another step of recovery, putting a lot of emphasis on physiotherapy and recovery, you know, these days. All of it is focused around it and hopefully tomorrow I can be OK. It's a bit of… I think you can see it both ways. I think if you would have told me two weeks ago when I got the appendix removed that I would be in Australia ready to go again and fighting for pole position, I would have 100% taken it. After being P1 in Q1, P1 in Q2, and knowing that I left some time on the table in Q3, it's obviously a bit disappointing, but it's normal also. I didn't do quali in Jeddah. I'm probably a bit out of shape also and I'm probably still learning this new car. I missed a qualifying session in Jeddah and a full race. So probably there were things there in Jeddah that I could have learned through quali that I could have applied today that I couldn't apply in Q3. And the car surprised me in a couple of corners once we started to crank in the flap. And yeah, it wasn't the cleanest of laps. But as I said, if you would have told me even five days ago that I travelled here still recovering, that I could be on the grid and fighting for pole, I would have taken it. I think nowadays you need to be 100% to beat Max and today I wasn't. And probably due to that, I missed out on pole. I think today if I would have done 100% good job, pole position could have been possible. And if I would have felt 100% and I would have done Jeddah, I think that 59 was achievable with the way I was driving. and the way I felt in the car, and tomorrow will be the same. I need to be 100% to beat Max. I will give it my absolute everything to do it because it's been a while since Singapore, and he's been on that top step since. But yeah, if there's one weekend where we have a good pace, it's this one. Tricky track to overtake, tricky on tyres. So who knows? I think we might have a chance. I haven't thought about it, to be honest. I haven't given it too much of a thought. I was just going through quali there in my head rather than going through tomorrow. But, well, first of all, it's high degradation in Medium compound. obviously the Hard hasn't been touched yet by many teams or by anyone really, so there's a lot of unknowns going into tomorrow. The biggest thing we saw is that it's very easy to grain the Medium tyre. So being in traffic behind the Red Bull might not be the best for that tyre. And then let's see how the Hard behaves, if the Hard is a good tyre or not. But for sure, having two cars is always better than one. But the race pace today and yesterday has been good enough to make me believe that if I'm feeling good tomorrow, I can give it a run for the win. If not, we will have to keep learning and keep seeing how we can keep getting closer to Max, obviously leaving everything to see how I feel also during the race physical-wise. Keep doing what I've been doing up until now, which is working and it's helping me to be here today. What I've been up to over the last few days, I'll let you know maybe after the weekend. But I can tell you it's been a lot of things. And yeah, I'll let you know later in the weekend or after the weekend. But keep doing what I've been doing up until now that this allowed me to be here. Yeah. Without going into too much detail, as I said, I feel like… It's exactly what Alex told me before jumping in the car. He said when he got his appendix removed, just with the G-Force, everything in the inside just feels like it's moving more than normal and you need some confidence to brace the core and the body as you used to do before, but you get used to it. It's something that you... There is no pain. There is nothing to worry about. It's just a weird feeling that you have to get used to while driving, especially these circuits. We're pulling 5 or 6 Gs in some of the brakings and some of the corners. So yeah, obviously, everything is moving. But as I said, without pain, and I can deal with it, and I can adapt to it also. I was very happy with the Medium tyre this morning, particularly in the high-speed corner. The Soft is a tyre that I just cannot drive with full confidence and keeps surprising me, with the front saturating and the rear giving you snaps because the carcass is just, I think, too soft for my liking. So yeah, it was actually nearly P1 on the Medium. So if you would have given me four sets of Mediums for quali, maybe I would have taken them. But yeah, come quali with a higher track temp, as Max said, You can do a lap time in the low speed with a Soft and then in the high speed survive with not a lot of confidence, but survive. It actually cost me in the Q3 lap that moment in 9 and 10.",Australia,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, I think definitely there was a bit more in it. My first sector was not great, especially Turn 1. I think on my final attempt, I didn't hook up the whole combination, which straightaway is a tenth, a tenth-and-a-half. But I'm happy. I think given how we've been during the weekend, it's been a very nice progression. I think tomorrow we got to fight on our hands to the Ferrari and to the rest of the field because I think the degradation is going to be very high. So I think, yeah, starting position is not that relevant at the moment. Yeah, we will find out tomorrow. I think we've changed a bit our strategy for tomorrow and let's see who can survive the most on the gradation side. Yeah, got my full lap in place. I think I messed up a bit in Sector 1. And I think there was a little bit more in it. I think it's been a very tricky qualifying with the tyres, just getting the best out of them and through the lap.  In all different sectors the requirements seem to be very different, sector to sector. So I think overall, yeah, I think definitely P2 was achievable today, but I think Max, the lap he did was quite strong. But I'm not too concerned. I think it's going to be a long race tomorrow. Degradation is going to be very high. So I think as long as we are able to have good pace in the race, we should be able to come through. It hasn't been a straightforward weekend. I think we've been playing around with where we started on the base set-up and where we ended up. We've changed quite a bit. Just chasing the balance, chasing trying to have the degradation for tomorrow. We've done some bits and we'll see what we are able to do. If the things we've done will have an impact on degradation tomorrow. Yeah, I think it's mainly the Soft tyre is quite tricky. I think it's really soft for this track. So I think when you are on the Medium, you feel more comfortable. You can push pretty much throughout the lap. And on the Soft, it always feels like a bit of survival mode, a bit of tyre management. If you take too much out of the tyre in a corner, then it can easily make you lose a lot of lap time for the next corner.",Australia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, definitely a special race for me. I mean, for any driver, a home race is always good fun and a privilege. But like you said, for me, it's about 10, 15 minutes away from where I grew up. So, yeah, well and truly a home race and excited to be back. I mean, that took some good fortune. So I need some more for this year to get on the podium, I think. Yeah, I think he did a really good job. Yeah, obviously stepping in on Saturday morning for Ferrari as well, nonetheless. I think he did a great job. We were joking with him on the driver's parade about what his neck strategy was going to be for the race. And looking at some of the onboards, I think he's probably still a bit sore. But no, he did a great job, honestly. And yeah, I think he can be very proud of his performance. I think being realistic, yes, being in the fight for the third quickest team is probably where we're at at the moment. I think we were a step closer to being close to Ferrari, at least anyway in Saudi, but we're still... We don't quite have enough at the moment. So I think probably the fight is with Mercedes at the moment for us. Hopefully we can start challenging a bit more later in the year, but for now, yeah I think as much as I don't want to put people's hopes down at home, I think yeah any more than sort of P5 is going to require some good fortune, yes. So Boronia is the remote control track. OK, wow, we're really going back! I think I was like seven when I first raced there. I honestly haven't been out to the RC track for years. I probably should make a trip back and have a bit of fun. But yeah, that was where it all began for me, really. Before go-karts, that's sort of what I started with. So yeah, maybe a less orthodox way of getting into racing and yeah, at the go-kart track down at Oakleigh, yeah it's a privilege to have my name on the on the straight. That's where I started in go-karts years ago. I was just chatting with Lando just a few hours ago. He drove there yesterday and I think the club let him know who the track belonged to. But no, we were talking about it and it's one of the toughest tracks in the country. Lando very firmly agreed. I think his ribs agreed as well. But it's a massive privilege to have that sign up there. And yeah, I'll have to try and make a trip back. It's certainly a bumpy place and I need to prepare my ribs for it if I go back. But no, a massive honour to have my name up. Yeah, I remember watching the race on TV. And I mean, similar kind of thing as well. When I saw he got disqualified… ‘ah, he finished second, it's all right’. So I kind of went through on a much, much lower scale, the same kind of thing. I saw an Aussie on the podium and that's all I remember from that day. So yeah, pretty wild to be racing around the same track 10 years later with the same guy I was watching on TV. It's pretty cool. So, yeah, hopefully we can both have a good weekend and make the home crowd proud. The year after, actually, 2015. I was a grid kid holding Dany Kvyat's flag, and he broke down on the formation lap. So I was his good luck charm for that weekend. But that was the first F1 race I saw live, and I think the only F1 race I saw live before I went into F3 and saw it from the support paddock. Yeah, that was a very special weekend as well.",Australia,thursday,McLaren
Daniel Ricciardo,"Yeah, it was. I mean, I remember being on pit wall here. It was my first race attending and I was watching the cars and there was that, yeah, certainly a bit of envy as I saw them all pull out of the garage. I kind of knew already that I wanted to do it again. But yeah, this was where, I felt it most. And then every race I went to after that, I was, ‘OK, I'm ready’. Ten years ago, actually, it happened. I stood on it. Actually, Mark stood on it. Mark stood on it as well, didn't he? His first race. We'll have to wait and see. Obviously, it's a dream for us, any driver really, to be on their home podium. So yeah, that would be ideal and an amazing, I would say, career moment for both of us. But yeah, I think for us to get there, it would probably take a little bit of a race like last year. But yeah, we'll do our best.
OP: Yeah, I think we're both going to need some good fortune to end up on the podium. But yeah, it would be very, very special. I don't buy into any of the stories, if you will. I know, obviously, what my position is in the team. I know, let's say, some potential things that could happen if I do really well. But that's all just... It's like everything you know. I think any team you're with, you know if you have a really strong season it could lead to maybe something different or increase your position where you currently are. I think it's always our objective to do the best we can. And I think whatever happens will happen or can happen. But for us, my objective is to drive this car as good as I can. I think now getting back into a car I'm definitely not looking too far ahead. So am I thinking about the Red Bull seat that you speak of? No. I know if I do some really good results, maybe then that can present itself potentially. It's not something I think about because, yeah, as you said, 12 months ago, I wasn't in this position. I didn't know if I would be back in this position. So I think I just take it weekend after weekend. There will always be some, yeah, whatever going around. But I know my job and what I need to do. And I think the more I get… Look, it's through experience as well. But the more you get caught up in that stuff, then that starts taking focus away from my job and that’s driving as fast as possible. I know we do a lot of other things during the course of a race weekend but that's why we're here ultimately, to push the car to the limit and try to make it as good as it can be. So this weekend it's something I look forward to obviously being here racing at home, but yeah, as you said, after the first two races it hasn't been amazing. but it's not a concern I think it's two races out of 24 and there's a lot of new people in the team. So it's very early, but I do definitely want to have a strong weekend and yeah, do well. No, it's not annoying. I think there's always, as a big part of our job… The most important part is the driving, but a big part of it is talking to you guys and obviously hearing when things go well, obviously everyone's talking positively and when they don't, they don't talk so positively. So that's part of it. I think also the more I get into the sport, the more I just know that I'm back here because I believe I can do it. I believe I belong here, and it's really that. When people say, do you have a point to prove or anything, or do you need to keep people happy or please anyone, I'm here for myself. It's honestly that, because I know I can still do it. I do want to make people proud, the people that support me. If someone says something, I know it already, because I've told myself that, or I know what's expected from me. So that's that. Of course, I want to be qualifying Q3. I want to get these results that I believe I can. But it's tight. We're in such a tight midfield. And like Bahrain in quali, I knew I didn't put the lap together I should have. And I put my hand up for that. And that's the difference. That's the difference from maybe P14 to a Q3. I think end of Q1 in Saudi from P9 to P16 was less than a tenth. So you can very quickly look like a hero or not. And that's where every tenth counts. And that's where obviously I look to myself first. I'm happy to speak on it. I think he did, obviously, a tremendous job. Probably the way I view it as well is when there's only 20 of us on the grid, there is obviously a lot more talent than just 20. So that's where you see someone like Ollie, who obviously has a lot of talent and, yeah, he had that opportunity to show it and he did really well. And, you know, so I think it just speaks to how tight this sport is and why, yes, there is maybe things and pressure and all that to perform because there is always going to be someone that is coming through the ranks and has obviously a lot of potential and a lot of talent. So yeah, Ollie did great. I think everyone recognised that. And it's not easy because there's… It's like any sport, you can be the best in practice but when it comes to shining under the lights things can change, and he obviously did a really good job under the lights as well. So, yeah, we found some inconsistencies across cars. And that, I think, was obviously… As I touched on earlier, when it's so tight, you know, especially in our position, you need everything to obviously try and be there. So that was that. And then in the race, you know, early in the Safety Car period, we had a slow stop. So then it put us at the back and yeah, pretty much in a DRS train after that. So then you're out of position and that kind of made it a very long and tough weekend. So ahead of this weekend, I think everything's been addressed. I've been speaking with the team a lot. I was back in the sim as well after Saudi and before heading home. So yeah, I feel like we've done everything we can to come here with our best shot and I'm very, very happy that we're probably 24 hours away from getting in the car. Yeah, on the podium, obviously at the time of standing on the podium and all that, I thought I had it. So I think that's what I still hold on to in terms of, you know, in that moment in time, I stood on a home podium and the crowd all thought I had the podium at the time and the anthem and all of that. Actually, no, I would have got the anthem because it was, yeah, I wasn't first. But in my head, the anthem was playing. The German one would have been playing for Rosberg, but it was playing for me. And yeah, so I felt it and that was all real. You know, obviously hours passed then made it not, but yeah, that was always good and I was happy to get a taste. But of course I'd love it to stick and yeah it's crazy to think that was 10 years ago but we're still here. we're still trying. Maybe as I touched on a little bit earlier, the focus now, and yes it's something I think maybe it's a possibility long term that I would, as I touched on, yeah it could be a wonderful full circle moment and finish my career there. That would obviously make me happy. But I just approach every weekend now one by one. I think when the sport for me was kind of nearly taken away… You know obviously a year ago there was no guarantee I would be back here. That kind of long vision or long-term way of thinking is just not where I'm at. So right now it's really focused on where I am, Visa Cash App RB. We've got a big task ahead. Try to do what I can there. Try to kick some butt and then see where the wind takes me.",Australia,thursday,RB
Logan Sargeant,"Yeah, I mean, we've had some issues to start the year. Luckily, we've been able to iron those things out. I feel like, generally, the car is in a decent place. We have some underlying performance that we can definitely get out of it, but it's going to take a little bit of time. But yeah, I think we're just looking for a smoother, cleaner weekend, and hopefully we can start here. Yeah, I think it's similar, of course. You want more, but I think at the end of the day as well, the bottom five teams are so close that you're looking for every hundredth. And at the end of the day, when you're in that position, you have to try and maximise everything to leave yourself in the position for when one of the cars in the top five teams goes out to try and pick that point up. So yeah, at the end of the day, you have to keep working hard, keep trying to find more and more and hopefully your turn and chance will come to score that point.
DR: Also, every weekend, my approach is maybe this track suits us more than the last track. These things can also be very track dependent. You kind of know most of the time where the fast cars are and that but… OK, I mention it a lot, but Mexico last year, we were last in the Constructors’ at the time I qualified fourth. So coming into that weekend, no one would have ever expected that and you know, you can have a good weekend like that and OK, drive well or whatever, but the car obviously worked better at that circuit. So like, there's always this bit of hope that you also hold on to coming into every weekend. And at least I do. So I'm always excited. I know that, yeah, it's probably not going to win this weekend, but maybe we can be in the top 10 and get a little bag of points.",Australia,thursday,Williams
Esteban Ocon,"I think it was a very interesting race. There was a lot of fighting going on. And I think we managed to climb back up almost to the points at some stage. So yeah, it was a clean race. Not enough, unfortunately. We still have to work on the pace of the car and try to get it quicker. But yeah, an interesting race nonetheless. And looking forward to hopefully extract more out of the package here. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I mean, we obviously where we are. It's not a situation that we are enjoying as a team. I think none of us, you know, in Viry or Enstone is enjoying struggling that much in the weekends. It's a long season and obviously we are working towards, you know, trying to optimise the car, understand where our issues are and to turn things around. Hopefully, you know, it's more simple to say than to make it. So until we make it, you know, it's only words. But this is the aim that we have as a team. And yeah, we are not going to release the pressure on that until we get there. And that's the aim out of everyone. The morale is good inside the team. Everyone's motivated and that's the most important at the moment. There's a lot of small things that are not working the way we would like, but the field is so tight at the moment that details in the end, if you have many that are not right, make a huge difference. I remember being that far off the grid with Manor, but nowadays it's a lot closer to the field. The field is a lot more compact from P1 to where we are and it's a very different way of sorting things out. So, yeah, we will see where and how we progress through the year, but the aim is to progress. Yeah, well, just to respond to the question, obviously, it's the worst feeling you can have. And I honestly hate that, you know, when you do a good weekend and you are not able to enter the scoring points, you know, there's no reward for you in the end. But, you know, it's up to us to try and figure out and get more performance and get closer to these cars. But yeah it is tough to go into a weekend and you know push as hard as you can also mentally you know, to be doing the maximum knowing that there could be no reward in the end. But it's part of the job. You need to do the best you can with what you have in hand and you know that's why you know I'm here. Yeah, I mean, we've seen some good stuff from the F2 guys recently, and obviously Jack has driven with them and won races. No doubt that Jack deserves to drive more in Formula 1, deserves to have a shot at least in F1 in one race. And yeah, I mean he's obviously helping a lot with the simulator work that he's doing with the team and he's a great asset to us and a great character and team player as well. And he's done some really good work when he stepped in in FP1s in Mexico and Abu Dhabi in the last two years and it's a shame not to see him racing definitely and I wish him the best for the future. Well, I had an Aussie team-mate in the past. So, yeah, I know a few things. But, no, I'm not going to be speaking it now. He's better than me at doing that.",Australia,thursday,Alpine
Kevin Magnussen,"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's not the ideal way to go racing, of course, for any driver, but my race, after the first penalty there, which was my fault, you know, the contact with Alex, it was just bad judgment from my side. You know, the track comes back and I didn't create that extra room for him. So after that happened, it was basically game over for the point. And we saw an opportunity with Nico there, who was on a different strategy, and it worked out. So at the end of the day, mixed feelings about it at the time, but happy we got a point. These days, with the field basically split in half with the five front runners and the five at the back, the point is really valuable. So yeah, good that it worked out. I mean it's all I've… Well, I tested with the old naturally aspirated engines and I've driven both v10 and v8 as well. I've driven all of those and I think the performance of these hybrid engines is much more impressive. There's something about the old engines that you know is nostalgic and certainly the sound is something that I grew up loving and still miss to this day. Whenever there's an old car running on track, it's really unique and still something that is beautiful. So there's still part of me that hopes we can get that back somehow. But at the same time, I know that the world has moved on. Technology has moved on. There are new requirements for the technology we have and, you know, for it to be relevant on the market, on the road, for the cars is an important element, too. So, yeah, I don't know. Personally, as a driver, we'd love to go back in time and drive with those beautiful engines of the past. Well, I don't really. It's been so long. It feels like a lifetime ago. A lot has happened since. It's a nice thing. I'm proud of having gotten on the podium in my first race, but at the same time, it’s very frustrating to have done 10 years and not get back on the podium. You know, it's mixed feelings about that, too. But, you know, it was a great weekend. And every time I come here, you know, I get sort of that feeling back. And, you know, in itself, doing your first race in Formula 1 is special, no matter where you finish and then to get on the podium was just insane on that weekend. So a lot of memories, for sure. Well, I mean, it's not great. Obviously, the fact that if you execute a really good weekend, then on paper you still don't score points, that's not great, of course. At the same time, it makes it even more competitive in the Constructors' Championship because you've really got to win that B-class race to even have a chance. If you don't win that, then your chances are very small. But, you know, historically, statistically, there will be chances. There will be more than one car at some races in those 10 first cars that will not finish or have problems. And there's going to be races where it's difficult to overtake. And maybe you can be lucky with a Safety Car or anything like that. So it's not like all over, but it's certainly harder. Firstly, I think jumping in at a race weekend with a big team like Ferrari, there's got to be quite a lot of pressure. At the same time, when you get thrown in at the deep end like that, It can also kind of go the other way that you feel not a lot of pressure because the job is so big that it's kind of like unknown what the optimum performance should look like in that case. So I guess it was an awesome opportunity that he got, racing in such a cool track with Ferrari. Doing your debut race with Ferrari must be a very special feeling. Would I like him as a team-mate? I think, you know, looking at him as a young guy, you know, racing, I can relate to where he is in his career and in his life. So I hope all the best for him, of course. Nico is a very, very competent team-mate. And, you know, I think we have a very good dynamic in the team. We're working really well together. And I think, you know, the journey that we're on as a team, I think it's helpful having experienced drivers, but it's obviously out of my control. I think we've just got to make the maximum of what we have right now with the two drivers and the car we have, which I think is going alright. No, I didn't have any talks with him. He was very much part of Ferrari that weekend. I think he's our reserve driver for the races that he's doing FP1 this year, which is quite many. So Ferrari, obviously, really counting on him and putting a lot of effort on him, which is great for him.",Australia,thursday,Haas
Sergio Pérez,"Well, it was very, very impressive to see. I think, like Kevin says, I think there were some strategic reasons behind it. As a team, I think they worked well. They worked as a team, and from my point of view, it's not ideal if you are in the other side. But I think it's just, at the end of the day, you have to do the best for your team. And he gets paid by Haas, so he should do the best for them. I think we are heading in the right direction. I'm really pleased with the first two races, especially with the progress we made after the first one. I feel like as a team we are in a really good momentum. We are understanding a lot of what's going on on the weekends, the way we review the weekends, how we prepare them. I'm pretty happy with how the season has started and I think there is a lot more to come from our side. I don't have that clause. I don't know what clause Max has in his contract. I think it's best you ask him. I think Max, as far as I know, has a contract with the team and is fully committed with the team. The rest, I think it's not for me to comment. It's nothing to do with me. I'm focusing on my decisions, on what I have to do. And I think for us to be talking about other drivers when we don't know any facts, I don't see any point to do so. I think the team is in a very strong position because, I mean, with the results we're currently having, the harmony that there is in the team, I think to achieve that it just takes a lot of years probably. And right now the dynamics, everyone in the team is working really well together. The whole engineering group is really united. And you can see that on track and how efficient we've been in the last year. So I think I don't see any reason to change it. And it will obviously be a blow for the team if Max were to leave. I think we are in a much better place in terms of understanding. I think when the weekend is not going your way, getting back and understanding what things work for us and what doesn't, I think we are a lot better in that regard. We've been exploring a lot, especially towards the end of last year. We were exploring so much with the set-up of the car that we got to a point where I think right now we really know which directions, which set-ups work for us. And I think we are in a much better position. Also, we are starting the weekend a lot better. We're making a lot more progress during the weekend. So I think overall, I feel a lot more together with the car, with team for the rest of the year compared to last year. Just maximizing myself in all the areas. I think Max is a very complete driver that is very strong in qualifying, very strong in the race. Very rarely has weaknesses or makes mistakes. He's driving at a very high level. I think when you look back, even in qualifying, the last two qualifying, he's been the only driver that has been able to maximise his full potential come qualifying. So I think just focusing on myself, obviously keeping an eye on what he's doing, how he's getting the maximum out of the car, but at the same time, I think it's just important to focus on myself and get the maximum out of myself. And if I'm able to do that, I know that I'm always going to be very close.",Australia,thursday,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah i didn't get much of an improvement on the on the final lap, which I think is why we missed the front row. But overall, I think Max has done a tremendous lap. I think that was not possible for me today but I think being on the front row was achievable, but anyway, I think we are still in the fight for tomorrow. Tomorrow, it's a long race, and anything can really happen. Yeah, it will be quite interesting. I think it's going to be a long, fun race. I think there will be plenty of action. The cars around us are all very close, so it will be a very interesting battle tomorrow. Yeah, I think the whole day hasn't been as good as yesterday. Somehow we took a step back from what we were doing yesterday, but it's something that we have to understand, especially for tomorrow. I really hope that what we've done, hopefully tomorrow we will be in a better position come race day and be able to have a stronger race. I think yesterday was a very strong day, very positive. Over one lap, over the race distance, things were going on the right direction. But today it seemed that we took a step back somehow. I don't know if anything else has changed on the track or on our prep, but certainly something to review and try to come to the bottom of it. Well, I think it's going to be a challenge. You know, I think racing here, it's all about race pace, all about degradation. So I think the faster one tomorrow will finish in front. So it's a track where you can overtake. It's a place where you can race. So, yeah, there is a long way ahead of us tomorrow. Yeah, I think it was very impressive. I think it's a place where you don't want to get the call to do your debut, because it's one of the most challenging places, the one that you have to take the most risk, the one that you have to be the most confident with the car, with the balance. So, yeah, big respect for what he has achieved today. I think he has done a really strong job. It just shows how well prepared he is for the opportunity. So well done to him. Well, for me, the worst memory was that we got disqualified! Because a millimetre or so with the rear wing. So, yeah, I realised how politics works in Formula 1 straight away. And the positive was making it into the points in my first ever race. I think I was the only one on one stop, and it worked really well. So fighting some Ferraris on my debut was very enjoyable. Well, I think it's definitely a very good opportunity for any country to host these sort of events, you know, to show the world your country. I think we've all had a great time here. And I heard that also the E1 race was a really nice atmosphere. People were super positive about it. So it seems like definitely over here. they seem to like a lot the racing, any racing. So it's always good to come to places where the fans are passionate about our sport. Well, given my track record here so far, I've been going well. So it's definitely one of my favourites. I really enjoy street racing and it's one that I really, I think it demands a lot of the drivers through qualifying and through the race. You know, even when you finish qualifying, you are quite exhausted. And I think tomorrow the race, it will be no different. I think 50 laps tomorrow, it's going to be quite an intense race, so it's quite nice that it takes everything out of the driver.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, the first lap in Q3, we tried something different, doing a preparation lap, but that didn't work out well for us. Then in the second lap, I put everything together and that was what was in the car today. So I'm really happy with the lap. A shame that we are a bit further away than what we hoped in qualifying, but tomorrow is the race and I hope we'll have a good surprise and that we'll be able to challenge the Red Bulls in front. For sure, we did a step forward compared to last year. I felt more comfortable in the car. I think the car is in a better place in race runs. So we just have to focus on ourselves. And obviously, we cannot change the car now for tomorrow. So we'll try and optimise everything else for the race. And then let's see what's possible tomorrow. I mean, first of all, I hope Carlos will recover quickly. And then on Ollie's side, I mean, he's done an incredible job, obviously, with only one session in FP3. He was straight up to speed and comfortable with the car. So it's good. I'm happy for him, obviously. It's a very special day and the first race in Ferrari having done only one session I guess is even more so special, so I hope that tomorrow we can have a great race both of us and score good points for the team. Well, it's good to be starting on the front row. However, today I didn't really find the right feeling with the car. For some reason, with the new tyres, we didn't have the car in the right place, which I hope that for tomorrow it will improve a little bit. For some reason, we had quite a lot of oversteer and just the rear is not quite ready. So in Q3, we tried something different. We went for a prep lap, which didn't help at all. And then in the second lap, I put everything together and I don't think there was much more. But today, the feeling wasn't as good as what I had, what I was expecting, considering yesterday. I mean, more than expectations of positions, I had expectations of feeling and balance. And that's not what I found today, which for sure we left a little bit of performance on the table. However, Max did a great lap. And today they were just stronger. So we've got to work on that and try and understand for the future what happened for qualifying on that first time lap. We were just speaking earlier, I think physically it’s definitely the most or one of the most difficult races of the season. So that's going to be one challenge. Then apart from that, as always, you need to get the strategy right and we'll do our homework tonight to take the right decisions. Yes. I mean, I'm always optimistic, so we'll try our best. However, we know that normally they have the upper hand and they have a bit more pace in the race than in qualifying. And looking at the gaps today it’s going to be a difficult one to get the top spot tomorrow. But I'll do everything as always. Well, first of all, I wish Carlos the speediest recovery. And for Ollie, I mean, he has done an incredible job. Obviously, not having done FP1, FP2 is quite a big disadvantage. He got into a car that he didn't know on such a challenging track, like it is in Jeddah, and straight away, in FP3, he was on it. So it was good to see, and I'm sure that it's a very, very special weekend for him. I remember my first race in Formula 1, and I wasn't in Ferrari, and I had some months to prepare for that. So I cannot imagine how special it is for him to get the call this morning and to jump into Ferrari on such a racetrack. So I hope we can score good points tomorrow so that he keep those memories in his mind forever. Yes, just to have one more lap in the tyre because the balance felt a bit more in line with what I expected on a scrubbed tyre, so on used tyres. So we tried to have a prep lap just to make sure to try everything and to see whether it was feeling any better. But unfortunately, it didn't. So that's what we were trying to achieve. However, the results were not positive. Anyway, I don't think there was time to do a prep-push, but I wouldn't have done that because that felt worse. So yeah, there's still something we need to understand about this qualifying because the feeling wasn't quite right from Q1. And we need to understand in order to be better in the future. It's definitely one of the most difficult track of the calendar for sure, being a street track and so fast as well. But he handled it perfectly. As soon as he got with the engineers this morning, he had so much to understand in order for him to be ready. We didn't have much time to speak. The only thing I've told him when he came this morning, I was like, “are you excited?” And he was like: “I cannot wait”. Which, I expected this answer, and it was good to see the excitement for him for his first race in Ferrari and again he's done a great job. Yeah, I mean, obviously the positive part was the excitement coming into that first race in Formula 1. It's a moment that we have all been waiting for in order to get there. The bad part is probably we weren't as competitive as we expected. So I was disappointed. But let's say that there were more positives than negatives. Obviously, having done my first race in Formula 1 was a dream come true for me. Well, anyway, I don't think you have much time to think about it too much because this morning he got the phone call, he arrived at the track and then straight away he had to be on it because there were so many things going on. But I think also Ollie is extremely talented and he has shown it once again today. But there's been quite a lot of work done on the simulator and I'm really happy also to see that straight away he found the rhythm because that means that also the guys at the simulator are doing a great job. And that's all the preparation that he has done back at the factory is for something. And he's been prepared in the best way possible in order to be ready, which doesn't take anything off his talent. that has been, again, extremely impressive what he has shown today. I think the fact that it's a street track but with so many fast corners you are obviously on the limit of the car and every little bumps have an effect on the car and when you lose the rears at those speeds it's not a nice moment., so that makes it very, very challenging, as well as obviously the very high-speed corners. You need to be super precise and yeah, that makes it very, very difficult, because if you are out by 5 or 10 centimetres, it's not like you go wide and that's it. You touch the wall and it's done. So to find the confidence on a track like this is much more difficult than other tracks. Yes. Well, in terms of track, I've always been a huge fan of city tracks and obviously Jeddah being one and being such a challenging one it’s definitely on my top three list, together with… I mean, on my top four list, I wouldn't know which one to put. Yes, Monaco, Singapore, and Baku, together with Jeddah, are my four favourite tracks of the season.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a very good day, I think, so far. We improved the car a little bit overnight, and that gave me a bit more confidence to attack the high-speed corners. And around here, of course, it depends a lot on your confidence level, how much you can go to the limit. And I really think today I felt very comfortable with the car. And throughout qualifying, it's pretty crazy how fast you go around here. I think, in my first step in Q3, I was very happy with... how I did the lap. It felt almost a bit like, you know, the failed ‘21 lap. But then, of course, making the last corner. I had a lot of fun and the car was behaving really well. Yeah, as we have seen in the past also, you know, there have been a lot of crazy races around here. A lot can happen. Normally people always say it's a one-stop, easy to the line, but it's not like that around here. A lot of straights as well. But I'm confident with the race pace that we have that tomorrow the car will work really well too. Yeah, I think in general, just the whole day, I felt a bit more comfortable with the car. The balance was a bit more together. Yeah, I could just push a little bit more. And then qualifying was quite nice. I mean, no real big problems, and I could just follow the track evolution a bit, so very happy with that. Yeah, my first lap in Q3, I think, was very nice. Maybe Turn 1, 2, and the last corner, I could have maybe improved a tiny amount, but overall, the car was just performing really nicely. I felt comfortable. I could push to the limit. And on a track like this, when you have that feeling, I think it helps to get a good lap time out of it. It felt really nice, yeah. I mean around here there are some corners that are really like really tricky at high speed, to hit the apexes like you want to, and I did feel that that was the case on that lap with not hitting the wall in the last corner you know! So yeah, I was very pleased with that. I mean, there are always particular corners where I think, you know, we can find a little bit more, but it's about finding the overall compromise, you know, to be quick. That's most of the time on every track the same. Yesterday it felt good, even though I think the set-up we had yesterday was not as good as today. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow. Normally, we should have good race pace. And actually, of course, the degradation won't be as high as in Bahrain. So, yeah, we'll have to see how close everyone else is. But from our side, I think the car is set up well. Yeah, well, we'll see what happens, right? I mean, it's not where you win the race anyway nowadays. So, of course, you always try to have a good start, but it's important to just get through lap one and settle in. The first one was a very good lap, and the second one, I had a little moment between 9 and 10, so I lost momentum. From there onwards also, I knew that the previous lap was very good, so I was like, I don't want to risk potentially damaging the car for maybe matching the lap time again, if I would really put everything together. That's why I just lost a bit of momentum there and a little bit out of the last corner. Once you see that you're a bit down already on your lap time, on a street circuit especially, sometimes I guess it's better to just finish the lap and just deal with it. Yeah, from my side, you know, I have a lot of respect for Helmut and, you know, what we have achieved together goes very far. And also, of course, my loyalty to him is very big. And also, I've always expressed this to everyone within the team, everyone high up, that he's an important part in my decision-making for all the time in the future as well within the team. So, yeah, it's very important that he stays within the team, including, of course, everyone else, because, you know, it's a whole team effort. And it's very important that we keep the key people together, because I feel like if such an important pillar falls away, that's also what I've said to the team, that is not good for my situation as well. So, yeah, for sure, for me, Helmut has to stay, for sure. You know, he has built this team together with Dietrich from day one, and he's always been very loyal to the team, to everyone within the team, to make sure that everyone would keep their positions already from back in the day. And I think it's also very important, of course, that you give the man a lot of respect for what he has done. And that comes back also to loyalty, you know, and integrity. So, yeah, for sure, it's important that he stays part of the team also for me. Yeah. It's super hard to jump in on a track like this. And I think what he has done has been very, very impressive. Like, you know, I was watching his first few laps in FP3, because that's where you can judge if someone is a bit comfortable or not in the car. And by lap two, lap three, I was like: “Okay, that's a strong start. I like to see that.” And yeah, to be P11, I think only at the time six tenths off pole, that is more than I think you could have asked from him. So for sure, yeah, he's done an incredible job. And I hope, of course, he also enjoyed it a little bit out there because it's quite stressful, you know, when you come into a new team, basically, a new car and without any experience on this track. So, yeah, hopefully he's happy with himself, also, not that he says, “I didn't make it to Q3” or whatever, because I think everyone within the paddock has seen that he did a great job. The car broke down, so probably that was the worst of it. To be honest, when I look back at it now, it was probably my worst general feeling in F1 because you're quite nervous. You don't know really what to expect. I'd never done a longer race than 35 minutes because in F3, it was like 30, 35 minutes. So I think the race itself was actually going quite well. We were fighting for points. But to be honest with you, I prefer not to think about it too much. It was not really a highlight in my career. Yeah, it’s early in the season, anti-clockwise, a lot of G forces continuously in Sector 1. The walls are super close, so your focus is constantly at 100%. Some tracks you can relax a bit on the straight or whatever, but here the straights, most of them are not even straights, you're constantly turning, pulling G, so your body doesn't have a lot of rest. In some places, like Turn 22, for example, it's getting a bit bumpy. So your view is also a bit more difficult. And yeah, the degradation is very low. So you can push quite high every single lap compared to maybe some other tracks where you have to pace manage a lot more. And that, of course, naturally brings the G-forces down a bit. And naturally, you can ease yourself into it a bit more, which is not the case here. And yeah, I think that all together makes it one of the hardest tracks on the calendar.
SP: Yeah, I remember my race from last year with Max pushing all the way through the end. It was very intense, one of the most physical demanding races I've had. just because of the amount of G you pull into the high speed, but consistently. Like Max says, there's a lot of straight, but it's not really. You're always turning, pulling some G. And yeah, the race is just quite a fast, low degradation race. And I think it just makes it all together a very unpleasant race. I'm probably the least of the supporters of street circuits sitting here, but I think from all the street circuits, I think it's definitely a really cool one and a demanding one. That's for sure. But I'm still in favour of the historic tracks.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, we had quite a good pace because we had the fastest lap at the end. I got a bit held by a DRS, but overall the feeling was pretty good. It was a bit of a boring race because Red Bull were a bit too quick and behind we had a bit of a gap, but we took the maximum points we could today and that was the target, so that's great. From last year, it's actually a step better. I don't know why exactly. Maybe because I was a bit more on my own, so you have a bit less adrenaline in the car, but all in all, it's definitely one of the most physical race tracks of the season. It's warm, but most of all, I think it's more for the neck. There are so many high speeds. Very, very difficult, but also very, very fun to drive. I mean, he completely deserves it. He's done an incredible job already from FP3. He was straight on the pace in qualifying. He did a great job and missed Q3 by so little and I think today he's been incredible. I mean seventh in your first race in Formula 1, having done only in FP3 In a new car is just hugely impressive. So I'm sure he's extremely proud but everybody has noticed how talented he is and I guess it's just a matter of time before he comes here in Formula 1. We maximized everything today. We were struggling all the time at the beginning of the stints, whether it was at the beginning of the Medium or beginning of the Hards, we struggled to switch the tyres on. Then towards the end of the stint we were pretty good. With the Medium, we didn't really see that. With the Hard, we saw that towards the end, but it was too late to actually recover what we had lost at the beginning with the battles we had. All in all, it's been a positive race. I think we are doing small steps in the right direction. If I look back the last six, seven months, we are the team that have improved the most and we are slowly closing the gap. So the gap is still quite big. But if we keep working like that, I'm sure it's a matter of time before we put the Red Bull under a bit more pressure. Not always, but today was probably the case, so that was good. I have a very bad memory when I finished the races. I remember really well exit of Turn 2, where I was like, ‘oh, I hope Checo will leave the space’. And he did. So I kept my second place there. And then I cannot remember. I think it was quite a clean overtake. There wasn't much I could do. But we were struggling a little bit to defend today and also to attack. I think we had a little bit less top speed than the others, which was wanted. But we'll review that to see if it was the right decision or not. I don't think we'll have many things new in Melbourne. So without new things in Melbourne, I think we are doing a good job by maximising our package at the moment. So that's where we are. I think we'll probably have to wait and see whenever we have new parts to the car, what kind of step we do forward. And hopefully that will bring us closer to Red Bull. Incredibly difficult. Thursday practice, by the way! But yeah, he's been extremely impressive. Extremely impressive. I think everybody has seen that. Obviously having him in the same garage, seeing how he worked and how he approached this whole situation with so much calm was very, very impressive. Obviously with so much excitement as well, but it was really impressive. I think he has shown the whole paddock what he was capable of. And I think after a performance like that, it's a matter of time before we see him permanently in the Formula 1 paddock. For the DRS, I don't think that's where we are lacking at the moment, but of course we'll have a further analysis after this weekend to understand exactly what are still our weaknesses and try to update them since last race. However, today I don't think tyre degradation was a thing. It was more about tyre warm-up and we struggled a bit more to bring them to the right temperature in order to push. which made it also a bit more difficult because I had to overtake cars during my warm-up. And that was a bit trickier for us than for them. And that's where they pulled the gap, which then stayed more or less stable towards the end. But that was too late for us to put them under any pressure. Yeah, I agree with both Max and Checo. I think in Europe there's a very high level at the moment. I think Formula 1 is doing a lot in order to put the sport in countries where maybe motor sport wasn't such a big thing a few years ago, like here in Saudi. And it's great to see the new generation so passionate with motor sport. and I'm sure that with the increased interest we'll soon have drivers from countries like Saudi wanting to become a Formula 1 driver and then from that moment onwards it's all about following your dream and enjoy the moment and the road. That is quite a long road. Sometimes you believe that you cannot make it, but if you always believe in your goal and you work properly with the right references and the right people helping you then you will you'll make it. No, for Lando, I don't think that that was the thing that was making me struggle to pass him. I think it was more about the straight-line speed. But yeah, the re-starts obviously was quite tricky with the tires being a bit off the window. But I think everybody was struggling more or less. On our side, it was probably on the worst side. But then once they went into temperature, which was the case when I was close to Lando, then it was more the top speed that was making me struggle to get past. I think as a sport, and we've always said that, I think we need to bring the values of the sport in those countries in order to open the minds of people. Having said that, obviously we are in a very tricky moment for our sport. And I think, yes, we should focus on sharing the good values and there's a lot of work still for us to do on that, as we are seeing at the moment. But I will stay on the line that I believe that we are 20 drivers showing good values, the respect, and we need to keep going to those countries in order to hopefully open minds and for them to have a better future and also to inspire young people in order to follow their dream. And I still believe that this is a good thing anyway.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Ferrari
Sergio Pérez,"Yeah, we definitely made some good progress. I think it was a shame that we just qualified out of the front row because we had a great start. Unfortunately, Charles really kept it together and we couldn't get through. It was a nice fight then later on. And it was quite a compromised race, I'll say, with the Safety car there so early. It was a very long stint on the Hard. And it was tricky at times, especially in the beginning. We had no warm-up at all. We were sliding a lot. It took us a long time to get through Lewis and Lando. But I think overall, it's a great day for the team. You know, very different track to Bahrain, and we keep being strong. So, yeah, we just have to keep this momentum going. I think we've taken a step forward from Bahrain. We've done good improvements from yesterday, so we still have some bits to tidy up, and our time will come. Yeah, it was a shame that we got that penalty. Luckily, it didn't hurt our race but yeah I think in this scenario you know I was quite close to Max and everyone was coming in at the same time, we just need a wider pit lane! Yeah, it was quite a bit more chaotic. I had a great start. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep ahead of Charles because he kept it there and obviously I gave him the space into Turn 2 and it was his corner then in Turn 4. So that was a nice start, good start once again. And from then on, I was able to get through Charles, I think within two or three laps. And then it was looking good, the race. I was within three seconds from Max, and I think the degradation on that Medium stint was looking quite good. But unfortunately, then we were compromised with such an early Safety Car, and that meant that basically everyone just pitted. And when I was going out, it was actually my mistake, because I was told by the team to hold it back. But in hindsight, I looked on the right and there was nobody there when I looked. But in hindsight, I think the penalty was correct and that pretty much compromised our race. You are able to have a bit of awareness of what's going on around you, definitely. And when I looked at the mirror, there was no one. I saw that I didn't have the proper release. But I didn't see anyone. So sometimes the team can be a little bit slower than you in the car. But this time was the other way around. So... Yeah, my bad in that one, but still happily didn't change a race. I think things that we are doing with the car. I think last weekend was really a poor race in terms of how we managed it, the amount of degradation we had. But we understood the reasons behind it. The race was quite strong today because we were able to make the progress from Friday to the race. But I think qualifying, we just went a step backwards. And that's the main key from our weekend, to understand why we actually went slower than FP2 when you correct for everything. So it’s something we’ve got to understand the reasons behind it and make sure that we are able to keep progressing. I think it's always nice to go to places where the sport is the priority for the people. We've seen over the years that in this area it keeps growing and we have to remember that at the end of the day Formula 1 is a worldwide sport that we might race in Saudi but a lot of people around the world are watching us. So I think it's good that it's expanding from Europe because I feel like in the past, Formula 1 was very centralised in Europe, not just with drivers, but the people working in the paddock. And now it's nice that you see a lot more different nationalities within Formula 1, not just in the drivers’ side. I would like to see more on the drivers’ side as well. But just the people around, yeah, just having a lot more people working in Formula 1 from other countries is nice to see. Well, I have a good experience myself coming from Mexico. It's quite hard to make it into Formula 1 or into the sport because Mexico, the motor sport is good, but it's never as good as in Europe. You have to go to Europe at a very young age. That would be my best advice. Try to grow up as soon as possible on the racing side. Start fighting at a very young age with the best drivers in the world and they are in Europe because naturally the best level is over there. As soon as possible that they can get the opportunity to get to racing in the best countries for them, the better it will be. And that's the only way we will have a Saudi F1 driver. We’ll have to get you a membership in Disney+. I think Formula 1 itself, it's a great platform that gives an opportunity to new countries to expose yourself and you know that the whole world is watching you once you are in Formula One. So I think that's really, really good. It's a very nice opportunity for all these new countries that are coming into the sport. and I think as a product we are very unique. I think you have 20 drivers, different nationalities, great sportsmen with great values and it's something that I think just helps all those countries to be able to show themselves and try to keep improving and keep evolving, as the world is, I think. As always, every country can be better, but it's always important to be able to give back to the people.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think overall, of course, a fantastic weekend for the whole team, but also for myself. I felt really good with the car. And, yeah, also basically it was the same in the race. Of course, the last stint was a bit longer than we would have liked, but with the Safety Car, you had to go for it. So the last few laps also with those back markers, with the cold tyres was a little bit slippery, but we had good pace all around. We could manage it quite well with the gap also. So, yeah, overall, very, very pleased. Yeah, exactly. I think ideally you don't want to do such a long stint on that tyre, but we had to. And that, of course, around here with all these high-speed corners, if the tyre falls out of the window a little bit, it makes it all a bit more tricky. Yeah, this is always… Early in the season as well, anti-clockwise, a lot of Gs constantly throughout the whole lap, so it's definitely always one of the more physical ones. Yeah, I think it was a very good race. Of course, after that first stint with the Safety Car, we had to box. And I knew that it was going to be a very long stint to the end. But of course, it was the same for most of us. And I think we just managed the pace very well to the end. And yeah, I think the whole weekend, the car has been performing really well, probably a little bit better than expected even. And yeah, overall, of course, very pleased to win here. Well, I mean, the race in Bahrain, I think, was also very good. So it's a bit difficult. You know, it's very different scenarios as well. So I mean, around here, you know, you naturally have low tyre deg. So you probably also ask different things from the car. It was OK. Not very, very good, but good enough, I guess. So, yeah, that's the most important. It's 88 missed podiums! No, of course, very happy with that. But I'm not really a guy, you know, looking at the stats. So I'm just happy to hit 100. But I want to, of course, continue and just focus race-by-race on achieving the best possible result all the time. Yeah, it's a very different track again, especially also now with the new layout, the new tarmac. So, yeah, next week we'll go in the simulator again, try to set it up as well as we can before we get there. And then we'll just see throughout the weekend where we are. I mean, it's impossible to know how competitive we are going to be. Just I think with the back markers at the end, you know, the tyres were getting a bit cold and yeah, it was a bit slippery getting close to them. And of course, then also you don't want to take too much risk. We had a good gap behind. So that was probably a little bit of a difficult moment to pace yourself there. But yeah, in general, the car has been already from yesterday, it's been working really, really well for me. So I felt really good in the car. I always said that what is most important is that we work together as a team and that everyone keeps the peace. And that's what we, I think, all agree on within the team. So hopefully from now on, that is also fully the case. Everyone is trying to focus in the same direction. And I think the positive out of all this is that it didn't hurt our performances. So it's a very strong team. I think also mentally, what you can see from not only driver's side, but also mechanics, engineers, everyone is there to do their job. And I think everyone, even when there is stuff going on or whatever, they're just very focused on their job as they should be. Yeah, I mean, he didn't stop, so naturally he was ahead of me. And it took a few laps for me to warm up my Hard tyres. I also didn't want to take too many risks as well, you know, because when you don't have a lot of grip, it's easy to make a mistake around here. And, yeah, at one point, once the tyres had a bit of grip, I could catch him and pass him. So, yeah, it's pretty straightforward. Advice to race themselves. As a driver? Right. Yeah, I mean, you know, in some countries, of course, around the world, naturally, there is more motor sport history. So you probably grew up with it a little bit more. And I think we are raising more and more awareness around here in Saudi with the younger generations to get into driving and racing. And I think a lot comes down to education and guidance. The more help and support that there will be from people with a lot of experience, the more that you can grow it here and the passion. So that takes time. It's not that it happens within five years and suddenly there will be a Saudi driver suddenly coming through the ranks. You need to really work on that. It's good to see that they're loving motor sport and you can see the fans here. They're quite young in general, what you see around here. That's a good start and yeah hopefully of course we try to do this in in every country that we go to that is maybe a bit new to the calendar and hopefully one day of course wherever we go you maybe have a national hero driving in Formula 1. Yeah, I mean, I just stayed a bit on European, or even UK, I would say, schedule. So I would go to bed at like 4 a.m., wake up late. Yeah, I'm paying for that at the moment, actually. Yeah, I mean, the thing is, of course, also, you know, I have my own sim team, so naturally I'm just catching up with them a bit. And yeah, it's a bit of just unwinding as well. I mean, I don't have a rig here. I'm driving on my controller, you know, so it's just fun. Just not having to think about Formula 1 and just be with people that, you know, are friends. Whenever I can, I do it. Yeah, I woke up this morning and had an hour spare, so I just logged in and had a bit of fun. I think with sport in general, I think there are a lot of things that you can achieve everywhere in the world. Of course, being competitive and performing here and showing to a new young crowd what we're doing. Of course, we are not into politics. That's a whole different story. And I think also it's very important that sport is sport, politics are politics. Sometimes people like to be in the middle of it. I prefer to just focus on sport. Otherwise, I would have been a politician. But that's not my expertise and definitely not where I want to end up as well. And at the end of the day, every single country has their own flaws, but also positive sides. And we are not going to change the world at the end of the day as a sport, but we try to share positive values. And then, of course, it's also up to the country to make positive changes. I do think that since we have been here already there have been some really nice positive changes and you have to respect that and sometimes you know it takes a bit longer in some countries but I think it's very positive and yeah it's great to see and also great to meet a new culture as well I think for everyone you know to get educated on that as well, because everyone is a little bit different around the world wherever you go, and you have to respect that as well. But then, of course, also, wherever you're from, your country, there are always things that can be done better, right? So it's a work in progress in general. I've only been in Jeddah. The country is so big, when you fly over it, when you come from right or left. I think there are a lot of places that I would like to visit. I have a lot of my friends also that have been visiting, like the capital, Riyadh or even like Al-Ula. The Dakar rally, of course, is happening here. So there are a lot of beautiful shots that you see. So yeah, step by step, hopefully one day I can see a little bit more of the country. Of course, they're building a new city and there's so many, I think, exciting projects, of course, happening. So yeah, it's great to see the country opening up, I think, a bit more to the world. And, yeah, positive change. And that's the only thing that you can wish for, really. So hopefully from all around the world, you know, we can see more of Saudi Arabia. Not yet, actually. So I need maybe an expert next time that I'm here to have something really local.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
George Russell,"I think the conclusions we drew were that the car has potential. I think when we saw the pace on FP2, that was genuine, Lewis and I were P1 and P2. I think probably not everybody turned up, but we were genuinely fast. And then in the race, we had some really big cooling issues that caught us by surprise. And we know it was at least a 15-second loss just in the battery and the power. And probably more after you consider the effect it had on the tyres. and just an extra couple of seconds in stint one when I had Checo behind me would have been pretty handy. So I think we'd have been in the fight for P2, for the podium, with Checo and Carlos, but definitely we didn't show our true potential. I think it was definitely a miscalculation. It would have been quite straightforward to just open the bodywork very slightly and make things much easier. But we don't know how we fell into that place… Sorry, I was just distracted by Charles walking in there. I’ve lost my lost my groove now! No, we don't really understand why, because we didn't change anything from testing, in FP2 as well, and then suddenly it caught us out on Saturday. So I'm sure it'll be better this weekend. We need to get on top of it, and we've got some tests tomorrow to try and understand further what happened. Yeah, I think, as I said last week in Bahrain, this is my third season now alongside Lewis, the greatest driver of all time, and I feel like I've done a pretty good job alongside him. So whoever were to line up alongside me next year or the years to come, I welcome anybody, welcome the challenge. You always want to go against the best, but ultimately for me, I’m just focused on myself. I believe in myself. I believe I can beat anybody on the grid. And, you know, you’ve just got to have that mentality. So, as I said, having Lewis as my benchmark for the last couple of years has been a pretty good benchmark for sure. I think any team wants to have the best driver line-up possible. And right now, Max is the best driver on the grid. So if any team had a chance to sign Max, they would 100% be taking it. So I think the question is more on the other side, on his side and Red Bull's side. Obviously so much going on there. We don't know what truly is going on behind closed doors and ultimately it's none of our business right now. Yeah, I guess we'll be excited. I think after three days of testing, everybody knows Bahrain pretty well. It all panned out as we probably expected. But obviously, we all hope that the field tightens up a little bit right at the front. But the fight behind Max, I think, is really, really tight. And it's going to be quite exciting between ourselves, Ferrari, Aston and McLaren. Yeah, as Charles said, I think it's difficult to really comprehend from a television how difficult it is from within the car. You're sat so low, you only see the top 15 centimetres of your tyres and the cars are running, you know, 70 millimetres from the ground or whatever they are, even less at the end of a straight so we need a kerb that we can feel and ultimately some tracks we go to there are no track limit issues whatsoever. it's only a handful of circuits that we see a lot of track limits issues. So we just need to find a way to solve it. I think all of the teams have got a pretty good handle on the bouncing now, and we can probably expose the limitation or shy away from it. But as we know, with the ground effects cars, you want to get the car as low as possible to the ground and as stiff as possible, which has compromises. So the feeling pretty much is very similar to what you felt over the last two years, but just to a much lesser extent. But as I said, I think for all of the teams, you'll see some former bounce net points throughout this year. Yeah, I think we want to see all of the facts and just have total transparency, really. We're all racing here. We want a fair and level playing field for us to showcase what we can do. I can't really comment further. We were surprised a year ago when the result got overturned, as the legal team at Mercedes thought they did a great job of, you know, presenting our case and initially winning the case and then losing it thereafter. So, you know, we just want to see transparency and have the opportunity to race on a fair playing field. I wasn't following anyone, unfortunately. Did I? Yeah, it was quite good on the first lap. No, I think there are some thoughts of this. I wouldn't say it's getting easier. It's either staying the same or getting slightly worse. But I think it's only natural as we're all moving further and further away from the initial regulation. Yeah, I think... Well, two things. I feel that the racing needs to be at the forefront of everything. And this is what we all love and what we're here to fight for. And it's a shame when that isn't the forefront of the media attention. But equally, Formula 1 is at the forefront of technology. I think from an entertainment standpoint, I think we've been really pushing the boundaries in the last few years. And we do need to create an environment that is inclusive for everybody. We're seeing the demographic change over the past couple of years, and it does need to be inclusive. So unfortunately, you need to have these hard conversations and questions. And going back to the earlier point, you want to see transparency within all of these reports, because ultimately, until we see the facts, we can't really comment. But yeah. Yeah, following on from what Charles said, really, I think it's really great that Formula 1 are given the chance for these women to showcase their talents. And with all of the Formula 1 teams backing and supporting them, extra visibility racing on Formula 1 race weekends, I think it's just the beginning of a lot of great things to come.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"Well, it was kind of what we expected, more or less. Maybe a little bit better, but we need to wait and see. I think drawing conclusions after the first race is a bit too early. One thing for sure is that our focus is on the brake problems we had in the race. We've been working on it and I hope we can solve them. Not for now, but I think we are in a much better place compared to last year, where after the first race we were more trying to fix the issues rather than focusing on the future and the next upgrades. Whereas this year, the car is in a much better place, in a place that we expected it to be. So now we can focus on the future upgrades. So that is looking better. However, for now, Max is still too far ahead. To be honest, I don't think it's tough because I don't think about it too much. I'm just focusing on our own performance. We've got plenty of things to deal with at the moment inside the team, whether, as I was saying earlier, the future development is very clear, what are the areas we need to work on our car. So we are really focusing on that. But we are in a positive moment for the team after yesterday. the good momentum that we've had in the second part of last year to this year where we've had a pretty good winter where we've hit all our targets that we had given us and the car is again doing exactly what we wanted. so now we are just excited to be back out on track to get some other data to obviously bring the upgrades as quickly as possible and to hopefully put Max under a bit more pressure than now. Yeah, as I was saying, our main point of focus in the last few days were the brakes as we've had some issues in Bahrain. So we've been working on that. But we feel ready. And yeah, we will see. I mean, I don't know what to expect yet. As I said, it's difficult to judge after only one race. So we'll have to wait and see. But you can expect us giving our best to try and challenge for the win for sure. No, there are always fine tunings that you have to do, which we did. But no, we didn't have any issues like I've had on the race. Yeah, optimistic. I mean, again, after the first race where I don't feel like we could really show our true potential, I'm really looking forward to this weekend where hopefully we can put everything together and hopefully be closer to Max than what we have shown in Bahrain. I mean, on my side, it wasn't down to the overheating or whatsoever. It was just an issue that we've never had before. And that was obviously very costly in terms of times, especially in the first half of the race, where it was extremely difficult to drive. But no, I don't expect it to happen again this weekend.
GR: Yeah, similar to Charles, it was definitely a bit of an odd one for us, but we're confident we're on top of it and won't face the same issue this weekend. I don't know. I mean I don't think this is our main strength. Yeah, I felt like it was more the medium-speed where we were strong. And I think also historically, we have always been quite strong in Bahrain. So I'll prefer to wait a few more races to judge what our weaknesses, what our strong points, as it's probably too early to say for now. It sounds quite harsh. I think it is quite harsh. But I think the main priority should be in fixing or helping us at least respecting those track limits better because at the moment the way the white lines are we don't really see it. So I felt like five seconds was quite painful already. Ten seconds is, in my opinion, too much. I've heard that. However, on our side, this year is a little bit better compared to last year. So I don't know if it's part of the characteristics we have improved compared to last year, which made our car very difficult to drive. But this year, it's quite a bit better for us to follow. But yeah, it might not be the same for George. You followed me! Yes! It is super important to see this new series with all the Formula 1 teams involved. I think it's amazing and also to give the chance to all these women that are hoping to one day join Formula 1 and to give them a platform in order they can show what they are really capable of. So I think it's a great thing for sure. Yeah, it's good. No, I think we are always trying to fight on the limit, obviously keeping in mind that Ferrari comes first and we cannot take unnecessary risks. Again, on my side, I wasn't really in a position to be fighting properly, as we had quite a bit of issues to manage. Yeah, at the end it's a balance and sometimes we might go a bit more over the limit and be a bit too aggressive and then we'll have a discussion and we'll recenter that. And that's what we've done in the years we have been competing together. But I don't remember any time where it went as far of having a problem between us. So that is a good thing and it should stay that way. But I have no doubt on that. We have also a very good relationship outside the car, so we are very open and very honest with ourselves, so we have this discussion very often. So yeah, it's all about finding the right balance, but I think we did. I guess being precise. I don't think it's much different than other tracks. The only thing that is different here is that the walls are pretty close and it's also reliant on how much a driver is taking risk and how close to the limits you are going to get, because whenever you overstep it then that's it. That's the end of the session. But it's something that I really enjoy. City tracks are definitely my favourites, at least for the qualifying lap. It always makes things exciting. But yeah, probably precision and the risk you are willing to take. Yes, you do. You have to go through that step-by-step approach, like on every city track, because as I was saying, whenever you go over the limits, it depends on where exactly on track, but very often that ends up in the wall. And it's not what you want on a city track. So especially with the track evolution that is always bigger, the more laps you do, the more track evolution you feel, and the more you can put the car in the right window for qualifying and for that lap in Q3. So every lap is important and that approach is needed.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,Ferrari
Nico Hülkenberg,"Yes. That also wasn't that difficult because the base was pretty poor last year. But, yeah, obviously Bahrain, you know, we've had all that testing there. We had race, so everybody is obviously very honed in and optimised around Bahrain. It did feel much better for me in the car. I think you saw that on Sunday [sic] in the race too, although I was quite far behind after that one incident, which was obviously a big pity. But yeah, we have to wait and see a few more weekend events, different characteristics like here, high speed, how much we've really improved. We have to, whether we want to or not! Yeah, yeah. It does feel that way, you know, that we've done a better job on the aero map. It's more consistent, it's more predictable. It allows us to look after the tyres more. So I think it's definitely a step in the right direction. But again, like everyone here, it's early days. We've had one track, one specific track. So we need to wait and see what happens in a couple of next ones. The stuff that happens in the paddock right now? Obviously, I'm not really affected. I read it, I see it, but I think we are, when you're active, you're so focused on what you do that you don't really buy into it. Obviously, I'm not up there, so I'm even less affected. I don't really have an interest or an agenda there. So, yeah, not much to say. This is about track limits? Yeah. I think so, yeah. A more severe penalty. It is true, it is difficult to see, but yet, you know, I think we do have a feel. Some tracks are better than others, but I think that would force us, you know, to be more careful, for sure. So, why not? Yeah, very much the same. It's probably car-dependent. Some cars take it better than others. I think, like George says, definitely not getting better. Maybe slightly worse, but it also depends. If you have a bunch of cars in front, so two, three, it makes it worse than just one. So several factors that play into that. Copy, paste. Yeah, it's the same. It's going to be interesting and fascinating to see when they're here alongside us. We also have one, so I'll be watching. It's been good. It's been pretty positive and smooth. No problems, friction or whatever, because a lot of people were obviously maybe expecting that because of the story five years ago. But quite the opposite is the same. We've actually... yeah, I don't know, bonded really well and work well together, I feel. On track, you know, there have been a few situations last year, you know, where we don't even hold each other up when we know we're in different tyres, different strategies, and it doesn't even need a radio call. On the setup side and what we want from the car, I think we're also pretty aligned and work in the same direction. So, yeah, very good, yeah. Yeah, obviously he didn't have to settle or get to know the team, but I think he settled in well into his new position. He got thrown in the cold water, definitely. Obviously, a lot of new responsibilities and things he has to do now that are new to him. But so far, I think he's doing a very good job taking it all in, looking for the fastest way to performance, but then also medium and long term. He's got a lot of interesting and good ideas. So, yeah, it's quite refreshing and feels positive so far. None. Pretty different.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,Haas
Lance Stroll,"No, I don't think it was the hardest-earned point. But yeah, it made for a pretty exciting race, just with a little bit more action than I anticipated. But yeah, it was nice to pick up a point. I think we have some work to do. You know, we finished ninth and 10th. Couldn't really compete with the cars in front of us and yeah, you know, that's the goal. So have some work to do. But it's early days, very different kind of track this weekend. So we'll see how we go. I don't know. We'll find out. I just like driving cars. Yeah, I think still a bit of work to do on Sundays, for sure. had a car that was pretty quick on Saturday [sic], and then Sunday [sic], McLaren, Mercedes, Ferrari, they were all a bit quicker than us. But, yeah, first race of the season, so we'll see how we go here. I got nothing really more to add. I think it's a bit harsh but I mean , yeah, if you go off the track you get a penalty and whether it's five seconds, 10 seconds I mean yeah I think you know we're all pushing and all trying to stay in the track limits. I think some of the bigger issues are actually how the track limits situation is… At a lot of the tracks we go to, I think if we change the actual nature of a lot of the tracks and make it a little bit easier to stay in the track limits, but also just maybe more penalising if you go off the track limits – gravel, grass – we'd have less of these issues in the first place. I think most of it's been said. It's great for the sport. It expands the sport. And I'll be like Nico watching the races if we can.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,Aston Martin
Valtteri Bottas,"I also had lap one damage in the first corner already, which, of course, compromised the race quite a bit. So, yeah, I mean, the pit stop would have been nice to be a bit faster, but we've definitely learned from that. And, yeah, we’ll try to avoid those kind of situations in the future. But looking at the pace, calculating damage, everything, I think in the race we looked in a much stronger place than what we did on a single lap against the competition. So, yeah, some progress made there. Inside the team, in the end, yeah, it's a bit of a different feeling. Everything looks different, but also the mindset is getting to where it should be. So there's lots of hope with this current package. Still lots to unlock. And I think that's why people are excited and motivated. I think we just can't have the mindset that we can be satisfied with certain results. For example, the result last weekend. We can't accept that that is where we are. We always need to try for more. I think that's the thing that always needs to push for – something further and something beyond what we're at the moment achieving. Yeah, same for me. In the end, we are here to do our job, which is what we love, which is to race. And there's always talk in this sport, sometimes more, sometimes less. I feel like this year, off track, maybe a bit much. But I mean, if people read those things, then it's a good thing for the media, right? Definitely more optimistic than after the qualifying. Obviously, for my race, it's difficult to say with all the things happening. But my team-mate managed to deliver a solid race from where he started. So yeah, more optimistic than after qualifying. Yeah, good. Optimism level is good. 7-8, I would say. What I've seen looks pretty cool, like it's a massive roller coaster. I think it's the track actually with the most elevation by far on the calendar. So, yeah, looks exciting. Obviously, we still have to wait for quite a few years, but and yeah, there's been definitely good people behind the project in terms of the track design and all that. And looks almost like a video game, you know, but for real life. So looking forward. Along the same lines. I mean, I think it's awesome. It's really great to see and a great platform. So we'll be watching.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,Sauber
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, we talked about it after the race with the whole team and we're still unified and, you know, we're on the same page now. We understand each other. So, yeah, I think that's it really. At that moment, yes. But in the end I understand what they're saying. And yeah, I think that's it. It obviously wasn't an easy race in the end. So, I think that's it, yeah. Pace was good. Pretty happy with the pace. I think I was fighting in the top 10. So, yeah, definitely there's a pace and we saw it in qualifying as well. We ended up quite close to the P10 as well. So that was good. So I enjoyed the first half. And yeah, obviously, lots of things to take from there as a positive and obviously for the future as well. Yeah. 100%. Yeah, I think we were on a different strategy to Daniel. And he had new tyres. Well, he had Soft tyres. And I was fighting with Kevin. So obviously, he had more free air and he had more pace. And I think probably the team thought Daniel had more pace and there's more chance to overtake Kevin. So they asked me to swap the position. Yeah, I think that's it. Yeah, in the moment, I was a bit heated. I was quite getting heating moments in my brain. But yeah, I still, in the end, let him through, probably a lap later or half a lap later. So probably that was the thing. So in the end, the team thought they had more chance, and I respect that, yeah. For us, it was, I think, better than we thought, actually, after we changed a lot of things in our teams. And we were expecting slightly low, being realistic. But actually, pace was really, really good. I think better than we thought and I think we're more confident towards the end of the season in terms of development because of a lot of new people. So you're just now focusing to all the people to blend in to our new team and hopefully from three, four races onwards those people can actually push flat out then maximise their performance. Yeah, definitely. It's the thing I have to improve for sure. And yeah, I mean, if I do those things again, for sure, it will be more issues. And I know these are things I have to improve mainly. So yeah, I'm working on it. And yes, I'll show improve. Need more than two steps, you know, not just like one step, for example. And I have confidence that I can prove that. And it's up to them if they want me or not, I think, for the rest of the things. But yeah, mainly focusing on those self-controllers. Other than that, I have pretty good confidence. I'm achieving most of it, and I just keep improving. Yeah, very same as others. But, yeah, great. Can't wait to see my livery, you know, our livery, you know, and see the racing. And, yeah, I think it will be a great, great series. It’s still a learning process and probably what I showed in the Sunday was opposite, or Saturday, sorry. But I just keep reminding myself just before I jump into the car, ‘not pressing radio’, but also like, just those things, I think also they love to pick myself, to be honest, in those radio [messages]. Yeah, I mean, I'm not that shouting, you know, like that looks in the radio, on the TV. I don't know, the more I say, it's getting worse. So I'm just going to say I’ll just try my best to improve. And you'll see it on the track from these races onwards. We have very good relationship and definitely already he is helping quite a lot with things to improve our team. Obviously there are a bit of similarity between Franz and Laurent, that those two, they really care about each person in the team and I think each person's comments count and he tries to blend in all of it and make the best answer as much as possible. So I think there are similarities. Actually, I didn't feel [it was] hard towards him, like, struggling to adapt to him or whatever. We just straight up had a good relationship and I think we’re the whole team in the right way and right mood. And yeah, it's definitely not easy job right now to, you know, blend all the people in, to make sure everyone's feeling comfortable, because there's lots of new people coming. But so far, what I saw in the team, everyone seems happy and very, very relaxing, comfortable to work together. Yeah, definitely he came straight into my room after the race. And we talked about it quite long. Mainly understanding each person's perspective, his side and my side. And yeah, he definitely makes me much calmer when I was in the race. And he definitely helped me to face the right direction. And I'm feeling reset now and yeah, just move on from there. So yeah, he’s kind of like that, it's a bit similar to Franz, you know, if the same thing happens, Franz will come straight to my room immediately. So, yeah, feeling good.",Saudi Arabia,wednesday,RB
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, unbelievable. I think today it went even better than expected. I think the car was really nice to drive on every compound and I think we had a lot of pace. And yeah, it was super enjoyable to drive today. We really stayed out of trouble. And yeah, great start to the year. I mean, it couldn't have been better. Yeah, it was a lot of fun. I felt really good in the car. And yeah, it's always very special to have these kinds of days because they don't happen that often, you know, that it just all goes perfect, then you're just at one with the car and everything just feels great. Yeah, I think the start was good. Of course, the first corner is a very tight hairpin. So naturally, you want to defend the inside just to be safe, so that's what we did. And basically, from there onwards, we just focused on our own race. Yeah but that's fine, you know. It's a long season. And it's a great place in the world to be anyway. So for me, yeah, a couple of days’ rest and we go again. I think today was probably better than expected. The thing that changed was the wind and the intensity of it. So yeah, it just felt a bit better. I just had a better feeling with the car and I could look after my tyres quite well at the same time. So that was very positive. Probably a bit more how it was in testing as well. I just felt very comfortable with the car. That really showed today, so I'm very happy to kickstart the season like this, but also as a team, to have a 1-2 is just fantastic. But I also think that in general other teams are closer. I just think that today everything just worked really, really well, and I of course don't expect that to happen every single Grand Prix in the near future but still, we’ll take it, we’ll look back at it, of course, we’ll analyse it and we'll try to improve further. Of course, I don't know how they approach their long runs, you know, with fuel loads and whatever. But from our side, it was definitely not expected to be a half a second ahead, for sure not. But yeah, it was probably a bit better than I thought today. Yeah, but also at the same time you could see in qualifying it was very tight and yeah, there are things that we can do better and that's what we'll focus on you know for the coming races. It's a completely different track layout, a lot more high-speed corners. The tarmac, of course, is completely different to what it is here, so less degradation. Naturally, probably that will help other teams as well compared to us. It seems like for us always it's better to have these kind of tracks, so I don't expect that to be easy. Yeah, I do think that we are just not that great on one lap performance for whatever reason with the car. But luckily it's very good in the race for most tracks. Naturally, of course, you focus a little bit more on the race, but yeah, it just seems like other teams can maybe extract a little bit more over one lap than us for whatever reason. So that's what we'll look at for the coming races. But yeah, I really think that also just... The circumstances today with the wind helped us out a bit more compared to the last two days. So probably it was not in our favor with how the car is responding at the moment. Well, I don't really think about that. I go race-by-race because there are so many different scenarios. And this is a very particular track as well. Probably one of our strongest anyway. So I don't want to think about these kind of things yet. I just want to now focus on what to improve from this race onwards. And then look at Jetta, how we prepare there. But I'm not looking ahead too much. From my side, it was quite clear after testing and also practice that we needed to do what we did with the Soft being a good tyre and the Hard being the Hard. So never big question marks, to be honest. Yeah, I mean, also from my side, knowing how much to push or not. I think the first lap, Charles, was in the DRS at least once. But yeah, you want to push and save your tyres, so it's making that decision. But for sure, on some tracks, it will be quite tricky because the DRS can be very powerful. So it might create some, let's say, interesting battles or situations. I think today everything just went really well. The balance, the feeling for myself in the car. And that is not always like that. I mean, sometimes you win races, but you're maybe not very happy with how you were feeling with the car or the balance of the car. But yeah, today that was all very good. Yeah, I mean, this weekend, of course, I think in the race, we're still very strong. But if you look at qualifying, I, of course, put it on pole. But the fastest lap was done in Q2 by Charles, you know. So over one lap, I don't think it's that straightforward. And every track is different. So maybe we rock up in Jeddah and you have a different feeling. And naturally, on tracks with lower degradation, teams will be closer. And yeah, luckily, we don't have too many Singapores on the calendar. Otherwise, it might be a bit of a struggle for us. But let's see this year if it's a bit better on street circuits as well. I think the feeling in the car is pretty similar, just a little bit better. I think that is what we really wanted. I mean, last year's car was already very good, with some tiny improvements here and there. I think especially also a bit more low speed, the car just feels a bit better. But overall, when I jumped in, it didn't feel like a completely different car to drive or whatever. So that was positive. And, yeah, for sure, it's always a little bit of, you know, maybe for me more than the team, a question mark. Like, if you look at the car, you're like, oh, is this going to work? But clearly, you know, they have done their homework. They trust all the simulations and also the wind tunnel. And it has shown the last few years, you know, that they have been very good at it.",Bahrain,post-race,Red Bull
Sergio Pérez,"I think it was the maximum we could have achieved. It was a quite a tricky race, you know, with the management of the tyres – I think there's plenty we will learn from tonight's race, which will be important for the championship. But overall, I think it's a great way to start the season. it was really compound to compound, the amount of sliding we were having, we would have some issues with the engine braking, the driveability, which is not easy around here, because there is plenty of low-speed. But like I say, you know, I'm sure we will analyse all of that tonight and make sure we learn for Jeddah. Yeah, definitely. I think it's a good team momentum and we’ve got to keep it up for the coming weekend. Yeah, I think starting from P5, it's always nice to make good progress. There were a lot of battles on track, which around this place, you just go into a very different strategy once that happens. You are sliding a lot more in traffic. And I think overall, it's a very good team result. Yeah, it was quite close with the Ferraris, with the Mercs early on. We were fighting with the DRS, obviously, being a lap earlier. It just changes a few things out there. Yeah, I knew that it was just about managing, you know, because he obviously pushed us to stop early and we just stopped quite early, actually. And it was going to be a very long stint, so we managed to progressively build a gap, keep that gap between us consistent and I think it worked well. We had a few other issues with the car towards the end of the race that meant that our degradation was getting quite a lot worse towards the end of the race. Yeah, I think today was a very nice surprise. We were expecting definitely the people around us to be a lot stronger. I think, like Max says, you know, this is probably the worst place for degradation. So I think the better it is, the closer you will get. So Jeddah will be a very different challenge, so it will be interesting to see where we are there. Yeah, a lot. You know, I think also I believe that the car will be strong there with the high-speed content. So I think there should be another strong weekend for us. Yeah, it was straightforward. I think the Hard is just not performing as well as with the other teams. And we seem to be better looking after the Soft. So it worked really well to be able to save a new Soft. Thanks. I think it definitely changes the way you race, you know, and especially with the cars around you when you are in a fight and straight away you get DRS. Like I saw Carlos, he lost DRS early on and he was just out of contention for a while. And the car ahead going straight into the clean air, it's basically going on his own, has to use more of his tyres, so it's a bit of a disadvantage if you are fighting, I think, in places like Baku or even Jeddah, you know, having that sort of... I think the racing is going to be different. It does create a difference to the car ahead in the first few laps. So, yeah, it's going to be interesting, I think. The whole first stint between Mercedes, Ferrari and myself was very racy throughout. So I think that the change in DRS is making a difference. Yeah, I think it was definitely a risk, you know, to change the concept, but everything has been working. The car, it's very similar balance-wise to what we had last year. It's just, like Max says, just better in all regards. But I think we... we're still learning of our new car like everyone is. so I think when we take it to very different circuits we we're going to be learning a lot. so hopefully we keep this progression going and we are able to develop the car stronger than our rivals.",Bahrain,post-race,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"I felt really good out there today. The start wasn't ideal but from then on I just managed my tyres well. And then from there, I could do my pace, overtook two or three cars on the way to the podium and then keeping up with a Red Bull there at the end, which was a pleasant surprise. Still not enough, not where we want to be, but a good step forward compared to last year and a solid start to the season. Yeah, we had a very clear plan, using Soft and then two Hards. With the Hard on our car we feel a bit more comfortable, because it overheats less, it degrades less. It is a bit of a trickier tyre with warm-up and with front  locking but then once we get it working in our guard, you can push on it. In the Red Bull you can see different traits, different strategy choices, but I think also that's the beauty of F1. And yeah, we could play around a bit with strategy today. Let's see. It’s the first different circuit that we go with these new 2024 cars, so it will be a bit of a surprise for everyone to see where we are. I expect the cars like the McLaren and the Red Bull that last year they were very good in high-speed circuits to be competitive there. But you know our car has also improved in the high speed so hopefully we can be also stronger. I think it's just important to start the season well, start the season with a strong race, not just for my future, just for myself, you know, because last year I spent a lot of the races, you know, looking in my mirror, saving tyres, defending my position. And I remember at the car launch saying, yeah, this year I wish we had a car to go racing, you know, and attack people and don't care too much about the tires and make some overtaking moves and look forward rather than look backwards. And it's exactly what we got. You know, I got an attacking race, a really good race pace and from there everything felt really good to finish P3. It wasn't a straightforward and an easy race, but yeah, I enjoyed it a lot. Yes, the first stint and the beginning of the second stint, whenever we were in traffic, we were having a lot of brake vibrations and the pedal at one point started to go long. So it was always a balancing act between, do I go for it and try to get rid of the dirty air and overtake people, or do I start saving my brakes because they're going to fail or something's going to happen? I started saving by moving a bit on the straight to cool the side that it was getting hotter and the vibration started to get better. And then I could start to make moves and move forward. But as I said, the start wasn't great. The brakes were still a bit of a limitation for a bit. And then once everything settled, I could do my pace, do my overtakes and go for the podium. It never felt close inside the car. Whenever I do an overtake on my team-mate I will always try and leave as much margin as possible, and I try and do it whenever I feel like I'm fully under control and I'm not putting any car at risk. And that's exactly what I did. I felt like a very good move. And yeah, always keeping an eye on Charles and not making him also lose time or anything like that. You guys need to consider that we've been testing here three days and I've been seeing that Red Bull degradation on Soft and it's exactly the same as ours on the Hard. So as soon as I knew Red Bull had a new Soft for the last stint, and Checo had it, it's not like I went, ‘OK, this is my chance’. I've seen the long runs they did on the C3 tyre, the Soft tyre in testing, and you could see that they basically have the same deg on the Soft than what everyone has on the Hard. So I wasn't getting too excited. Also, I was in a bit of an uncomfortable position, you know, because you're there in the two-, three-second margin, which is where you get all the dirty air, but you don't get the advantage of the DRS and the slipstream, so you're just sliding a bit more. If I would have been within a second or maybe five seconds behind, I think on the Hard tyre I could have maybe showed a bit more the true pace of the car and my pace today. But in that two, three seconds is the worst place to be and I could never mount any proper challenge on Checo today. Again, no. When I saw the long runs of Max and Checo on FP2 and then the long runs of testing, there's no secrets. We've been here three days. I knew they had a three-, four-tenth advantage, maybe not half a second like George was saying, depending on track conditions. But I knew it was going to be very difficult to beat the Red Bulls. They also kept a new Soft, which shows a bit what the intentions and their plans were. So I knew the Red Bulls today were going to be very, very difficult to beat. So to keep up with one of them and have the possibility to fight is already a good surprise. I think we were at one of their strongest tracks of the season with very high tyre deg at the rear. Hopefully when we go to a more front-limited track and maybe better tarmac, our car will come alive and we will be able to mount a better challenge on Max for the win. Yeah, it's actually a bit of a relief, you know, because I remember last year, the last race where I was attacking was Austria. And we're talking about 13, 14 races ago. And then the rest of the races last year, you just had to manage. You just had to look in the mirrors. You just had to control your pace. And there were very little opportunities to go and overtake people. And I love going racing, and I love going overtaking, being aggressive, attacking. And with last year's car, it was simply impossible to do that. As soon as we were in dirty air, as soon as we overheated the tires, as soon as we pushed a bit too much, it was game over. And this year to come to the most rear-limited track of the season, the highest degradation, and do an overtaking. attacking race for me is a relief and it gives me a feeling that we will be able to do this more often this year. It doesn't mean we will do it every race at all, because I still think one of our strongest parts of our car is qualifying, so I think we will still qualify maybe ahead of what maybe our true position is, but at least we're not degrading and defending like crazy like we were doing last year. I don't think it was an intended undercut. I think Charles degraded the tyres probably a bit earlier than me, and they decided to keep me out for three or four laps. Honestly, those three or four laps were very strong. I think I managed to go down to 37s, low 37s again. So it was worth it. And then, yeah, luckily it didn't compromise my race because I could pass Charles fairly quickly and go and attack George, which I passed also quite quickly. So I don't think I lost too much race time on that situation. I think a lot of strategy comes into play, especially with how sensitive the tyres are to pushing. So on one side, you want to push to get out of the DRS or to get into the DRS. And then on the other hand, you want to save tyres because we all know how sensitive the tyres are in the first few laps to pushing. So it's a very fine line. I elected to, as soon as I saw I didn't have pressure from behind. I decided to manage my tyres and it paid off instead of getting into the DRS battle. So and then I could overtake them. No problem. And yeah, it's going to be track dependent. It's going to be, I think, a very tricky season going 24 races like that. We had it on the Sprints last year. So yeah, it's going to be a challenge. But another interesting thing to think about. I think the advantage of Red Bull in Bahrain is what you saw today very, very clearly. I think it's interesting how they can keep the C3 Soft tyre alive for a bit longer than the rest, how they tend to overheat a bit less. Maybe that's what makes the car also not as competitive in quality and so good in the race in a track like Bahrain. now we need more samples. But I expect Red Bull always to be better in the race like they were last year. Look at the last eight races between Charles and me. We managed to do some pole positions a lot of front rows but then max in the race was pulling away massively and Checo was always able to overtake us. So Yeah, I hope that this year's trait is not as exaggerated and we've done a good step forward in that sense, which already I felt today. But they are still ahead. So now it's time to get our heads down and start developing this car to keep closing the gap in the race. I don't know the level of severity he had but for me it was at one point pretty bad too. It's something that you cannot discover in testing because in testing you never put yourself in 10 laps consecutive behind four cars getting all the hot air from the four cars in front and the brakes never cool down. I tried not to panic. I tried to put the side that was more heated, and I took a different line on the straights to cool them down. And yeah, at one point, the pedal started to go quite long and also a lot of brake vibrations, which changes your feeling on the braking quite a lot. But yeah, I kept it cool, managed them, and as soon as I got a bit of clean air, it cleared and it became a lot better. But it's something that we definitely maybe need to take a bit more margin going into the next few races. I hope we can be. I think we are a bit too far at the moment to mount a proper challenge for race wins if they put everything together and they make everything perfect. But the base that we have on the car this year and the aero platform and just the car that we've put on track feels and drives a lot more normal than last year. And from here, if we offset this level of downforce, you know, and we just keep adding downforce to this car, I think we can start getting closer to them. But we need to start doing it from now, because if not, they they're going to start pushing and getting far away.",Bahrain,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a lot of fun, actually. The track had a lot of grip, but with the wind, you know, the last two days, it's been quite tricky to get the whole lap together. And it was the same in qualifying. Q1, Q2, of course, you naturally go a bit faster with the track ramping up, but then to really get everything out of it in Q3 was a little more difficult. But, of course, very happy to be on pole. To be honest, it was a little bit unexpected. But luckily in qualifying, I think the car came to us and I felt a bit happier with the whole car. Yeah, I said already yesterday, you know, we just needed to fine-tune a few little things on the car to try and get that, let's say, perfect balance, even though with the wind that was not possible today. But luckily, I think we went in the right direction today and we could really push a bit more with the car. And luckily, another step in qualifying. I think the race is going to be close as well. We do look good in the race, and that's, of course, the most important thing. But, yeah, we'll see tomorrow. I'm confident that we can have a strong race. Testing was very good but then it was very windy so far, I think this weekend, and it was just a bit more difficult to get the balance of the car together and yeah it was just continuous work all the way to qualifying. and I do think that we made some good improvements on the car and I think that made us then do the lap in qualifying. I just had a bit more grip somehow. The first run, it just didn't really feel that great. The tyres never really switched on. And then on the final lap, yeah, it just felt better from Turn 1. I think it was just a very tight qualifying and I think it was just also very tricky conditions with the wind this whole weekend. So, yeah, if you can get the lap together immediately, you can find one, one-and-a half-tenths in a corner. And I think it was just good for us in Q2, Q3, especially Q3, I would say. It all just improved a little bit more. But yeah, I think throughout the whole of qualifying, you could see the gaps were super close and I think you never really knew who was going to be on pole heading into Q3. So I think that was very exciting to see. I mean, we have done quite a few long runs now, to the point where you almost get bored of it. Yeah, I'm confident that we have a good race car, but I think also what you saw already yesterday in the long runs, the gaps are small and it's about attention to detail and that will make the difference also tomorrow. It feels like it, because all the way until qualifying I didn't have a good feeling, where last year I think it was a bit better, we were a bit stronger throughout the whole weekend. So yeah, we'll see how that will evolve. I mean, that is something that has been around for quite a while, but you always try to optimize these things. But that was not really the balance problem of the car. It was just trying to get it in the right window with the front axle and the rear axle. You tried to tackle the front axle, then it shifted to the rear, other way around. It was all about just trying to find that middle way to feel a bit more comfortable. And also, around a track like this, which is quite hard on tyres, the tarmac is very aggressive and one little slide or a lock up can cost you quite a lot of lap time. So it's about small little things that can improve the car quite a bit. It's just trying to improve, you know, every run that you do, there are always things that can be done better. Of course, in qualifying, you're very limited what you can improve, but still little details can help you a bit. And yeah, just try to follow the track, which was not easy in qualifying to understand. But for sure, we improved the car from yesterday to today and then FP3 to quali again, a little step. And that made me just a bit more comfortable and you can then attack the corners a bit better. I think this is the safest way to go about it. I mean, it's probably not ideal, but I prefer that the cars are stopping in the pit lane than on the straight, you know, or in the last corner. So at the moment, this is, I think, the best solution. But we keep on trying to look at things to make it better. From my side, and I think what I can see also from the mechanics and the engineers, we are fully focused on the car and the performance here during the weekend. And that's how it should be, I think. And that's what we continue to do. Because it's not our business. We're not particularly involved in that. And we are here. We are paid to do our job. And that's what we are doing. And that's also what we love doing. So that's what we focus on. No, no, I think it's way too big. But if you say that now, then if it's better tomorrow, then you can say, ‘oh, it's unbelievable, the car is unbelievable’. Listen, when I look at how Christian operates within the team, he has been an incredible team boss. So absolutely, from the performance side of things, you can't even question that. So that's what I'm also dealing with. I speak to Christian a lot. And also, of course, throughout the weekend here, he's fully committed to the team. He's also here for the performance, of course. probably a little bit distracted. But like I said before, we just focus on the performance side of things. And that's how we all work together. It depends a bit on the weekend. But yeah, I mean, in general, you always look at competitors as well, if they are better in a certain corner or not. So there's always a discussion going on throughout, you know, the whole of qualifying. You have to find a bit more time or just by yourself as well. You know, maybe you have a feeling in a particular corner, you're still not finding the right balance and you try to correct that. Yeah, like Charles said, I do think that tomorrow is a little bit less windy. So maybe that's a bit nicer to drive. But yeah, it's always exciting here with the high deck and plenty of opportunities to pass and race in general. Second sector, maybe not so much. But the last sector, yeah, the whole weekend that has been about our weakness. So, yeah, I just couldn't really go faster. It was what the car was giving me.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I'm a bit disappointed, but yeah, we did a good qualifying. I mean, it's been a tricky weekend until now. We were trying quite a few things in FP1, FP2, FP3, and then I found the sweet spot in qualifying. Q1 was a bit tricky. Unfortunately, we put two new sets of softs, which compromised a little bit the Q3. But all in all, it's quite a good qualifying, a good start of the year. We are in a better place compared to a year ago, so that is good. Now we have to see the race pace tomorrow. Oh, yeah. I mean, in Q2, I think I did a 0.1, which was more or less the lap time that Max did in Q3. So it was there in the car. I think we lost a little bit the rhythm with the used set of C3 in Q3. Then you have to re-adapt to the new tyres, and I lost a little bit there, but all in all, it's been a positive qualifying. I'm confident we did a step forward, but we have to wait and see tomorrow how much of a step forward we did. We really think that Red Bull is still ahead by quite a bit in the race. I mean, so we'll see. But if there's an opportunity, as always, I'll go for it and we'll see what happens tomorrow. Thank you. Thank you very much. The car felt good. The last lap wasn't the best lap I've done. I think the best lap was in Q2, where I put everything I wanted in that lap. In Q3, I didn't really find the grip straight away out of the box, which was a bit strange, so we'll look at that. And yeah, having a scrubbed set also at the beginning of Q3, I think, put us a little bit on the back foot, because the track is evolving and it's a bit more difficult to read how much front flap you need to put for that last run. And there I think we lost a little bit the rhythm. I'm not really happy about it, but it's something we'll discuss with the team. I thought there was quite a lot of margin, but obviously being the first qualifying of the year, the team didn't want to risk it. So we had to run again with another new soft, which again, it puts us a little bit on the back foot for the rest of qualifying. I mean, if we could have done lots of things, but at the end we are P2 and three tenths off. I think it's closer than what it looks on the timesheet. But this is a good thing. We were expecting Red Bull to have a bit more margin than what there was today. So we are a bit closer than what we thought, but the biggest question mark is obviously tomorrow in the race. And I'm pretty sure they have a bit more margin than what we've seen today. But again, let's wait and see. Yeah, the feeling is much better compared to last year. Last year, whenever we had used tyres, the car would become very, very difficult to drive. The balance would be completely out of place compared to the short runs. This year, we are a bit more… I mean, we are in the right window now in the long runs. So it feels quite a lot better. It helps us to be more consistent. However, again, for the competitiveness, we'll see tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, I cannot speak for Max, but on my side as well, when you have a competitive car in Q1 and Q2, you are not pushing the car to its limits. In free practices, you are trying different things as well. And then it's all about putting everything in Q3. And once you do so, then you really understand what is the real competitiveness of everybody. So that probably plays a part as well.
GR: Yeah, as Charles said, I think when you've got that competitive car, you can afford to be a little bit more cautious in Q1 and Q2 – make sure you don't get any track limits. You're preserving your tyres for the following day. Here in Bahrain, you'll probably be seeing a lot of soft tyres being used in the race, so you don't want to damage them too much and then just pull it together for Q3. I completely agree. I think the FIA came up with a new system yesterday, which I think wasn't exactly what we wanted. So we all asked to come back to the system of last year. So it's an ongoing process where we try to find the best solution. But as Max said, I think you have to slow down at one point and it's much better to do it in the pit lane than on track. So I think it's the best solution we have at the moment. I think it's pretty in line with what we expected. If anything, it's a bit better than what we expected. Because again, today there's three tenths in Q3, but I think we could have, realistically in the car, I think we could have gone closer to Max. So a bit more, a bit better than what we expected. But yeah, let's see tomorrow. Yes, these cars are quite a lot wind sensitive, so whenever there's a slight change of direction or intensity, then it makes a big difference. But it's the same for everybody, so I don't think we should see anything very different tomorrow. Or at least if we see anything different, I don't think it's because of the wind. And yeah, it's a good track. It's normally an exciting race where it's quite easy to follow the cars and to overtake with the tyre difference, especially as it's a high degradation track. So I'm excited for the first race of the season tomorrow. It's actually the same answer for me, but for the first sector. We've been struggling all weekend and we cannot really find the answer to it. But hopefully it will be different for the race run tomorrow. Probably it's due to tyre preparation, as we've seen slight differences along the field and that might play a role into it. But yeah, we've tried and we are just struggling quite a bit in Turn 1, 2, 3.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Ferrari
George Russell,"Yeah, absolutely. Everybody at the factory have done an amazing job to give Lewis and I a car that we feel much happier with, a base that we can build upon. But ultimately, you know, Max is still out there in front. We've still got some catching up to do. But I think when we look at our qualifying performances of the last two years in Bahrain and our race pace, starting P3 for tomorrow is a great place. Yeah, huge amount of work. We've had some really great drivers back at base doing the work on the simulator. Lewis and I have been back on the simulator as well, you know, fine-tuning the set-up, making some improvements. Time will tell tomorrow if we've obviously made a big step forward in single lap in the qualifying pace. We hope we haven't compromised the race pace at all. I think it'll be a close fight between everybody other than Max. I think obviously Red Bull is so strong at the moment. Max is doing a really great job. He's got the new tyres as well. I think if there's an opportunity to take the lead, we'll go for it. But ultimately, I think the race is, for all of us, is for second. But as I said, nobody knows. It's the first race of the season. So excited to be back. And let's hope for some craziness. I think after testing last week, we wouldn't have expected to be qualifying third. And then yesterday, driving, we made a lot of set-up changes over the course of the weekend. And as I mentioned before, Lewis and I were back at the factory and the team have been doing a really great job to find these small improvements and we were really fast just in FP2, Lewis and I, P1 and P2, which caught us by surprise. But as we saw, it was so close out there. You know, if you take Max out of the equation, I think it was two tenths between P2 and P8 or something. And I don't think we've seen F1 like this for a long, long time. So, you know, we only dream and wish that was fighting for pole position and victory. And I think we're going to have a great battle on our hands for the next spot. No, I'd probably say the opposite, to be honest. We historically have always struggled when the temperatures have been a little bit cooler and that was always the case last year. But we know that with this W15 car, it's a totally different beast, a car that we're much happier with and probably the lessons we've learned over the last two years we need to put aside and go in with a totally open mind. Time will tell when we go to the future races, but I'm feeling really happy in the car. I think the race is going to be really close with Charles, the Ferraris, with Checo tomorrow, and we can see what we can do about Max, but right now he's doing an incredible job. I think what we saw in testing was our qualifying pace being a little bit offset and our race pace probably being next best to Max. Now we've improved the qualifying pace, we hope it hasn't hindered our race pace. It's uncharacteristically cold here in Bahrain at the moment. I think tomorrow it's going to be about 16 degrees by the time we go to the race and we're normally talking 30s or mid-30s here in Bahrain. There's a lot of unexpected things to come. The Soft tyre is performing well around this circuit, in the race maybe people will do two sets of the Softs, two sets of the Hards, a Medium. But it's the first race of the season and I think we're all just excited to get going. Yeah, I agree with the other two. Yeah, I agree with Charles. I think it was better than expected. I think we all knew it was going to be very, very close between ourselves, Ferrari, Aston, McLaren and Checo. And I think, you know, the gap in qualifying today was probably slightly closer to Max than we all expected. I think race pace is the important one. We're expecting probably a half second deficit. That's what we thought after testing. We'll see tomorrow, I think. You don't agree?
MV: Half a second! Is that too small? Exactly. Under-promise, over-deliver! I think history has definitely shown that even the regulation stable for a number of years always closes the field. I think the aero regs, that the team who finishes last gets more time in the wind tunnel, the team who's first gets the least amount, is naturally going to close the field. So from a driver's perspective, we want to all compete on a level playing field. And I think that is going to bring us closer. Yeah. Yes, similar to what the guys said, and just on Bahrain, I think it's a really great place to start the season. It's always a good race here. Exciting, it's a beautiful part of the world, and we will enjoy coming here to do the testing at the start of the season. So, excited for what's to come tomorrow.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Mercedes
