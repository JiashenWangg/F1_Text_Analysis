Lando Norris,"The world champion. Oh, God. I've not cried in a while. I didn't think I would cry, but I did. It's a long journey. First of all, I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone in McLaren, my parents. I'm not crying. My mom, my dad, you know, they're the ones who supported me since the beginning. Oh, I look like a loser! I mean it feels amazing, you know. Yeah. I now know what Max feels like a little bit and I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It's been a pleasure to race against both of them. It's been an honour. I've learned a lot from both of them as well, so I've enjoyed it. It's been a long year. But we did it. We did it. And I'm so proud of everyone. It's a bit of both. I mean, you can't not think of it. But anyway, it's a long race to the very end. You know, we've seen many times anything in Formula 1 can happen, and I just kept pushing until the last two or three laps, [then] I could ease it off a bit, but I was still wanting to fight to the end and that's what we did. That's what we had to do this season, you know, with Max chasing us the whole way, with Oscar catching up again at the end. They certainly didn't make my life easy this year. But yeah, I don't know. I'm happy. I had no idea. I had no idea. I didn't care. I mean, I knew what I did was fine so I had nothing to worry about. Yeah. I was just trying to enjoy the moment. You know, there's not many people in the world, not many people in Formula 1 ever get to experience what I've experienced this season and this year. So, I'm happy for everyone. I'm happy for everyone more than me, but yeah, I'm just crazy happy. I mean, look, it's been a long journey with me and McLaren. I've been with them for like nine years and we've been through plenty of crazy difficult times and plenty of good times, you know. So, for me to feel like I can bring something back to them _ it's their first Drivers' in many, many years _ so I feel like I did my part for the team this year and I'm very proud of myself for that, but I'm even more proud for everyone that I've hopefully made cry. I just laugh. It's tough to describe. It's tough to put in words. I mean, I just want to go and spend some time with my team, my engineers, my mom and my dad. I don't know what I'm going to say. So much goes into achieving what we've achieved today. You know, from all those years ago when I saw Formula 1 on the TV, when I saw a go-kart for the first time _ my memories the last couple laps were really just that. They took me back to where it all started because I wouldn't be here without my parents and the sacrifice they've done. My brother and my sisters, the amount of times they text me and I don't get back to them. You know, just everything. Everything that leads into achieving what we all achieved today. And this is not my world championship. This is ours. This is one where I get to say, ""Thank you, mom,"" and ""Thank you, dad."" They're the ones who sacrificed so much to let me be the lucky boy that I am today _ to live my dream, to do what I have loved doing since I was a kid, driving that go-kart for the first time at home. The best memories ever, you know. And so much goes into it every year. And for the first time, I really get to say thank you to them, to my parents, to my family. And I get to really make them feel like everything they did was worth it. They might have felt like it was worth it after getting to Formula 1 or getting the first win in Miami. But, you know, the thing that makes me smile every day is making my parents proud, making my friends proud, the people who support me so much through the plenty of tough times I've had this year, celebrate the good times that I've had this year. But I feel like I finally get something to say thank you _ not just in words, but in terms of the volume of a championship _ that they are just as much a part of as I feel like I go out on track and perform. They're with me through every step of the way. And today, I just get to say thank you to all of them. I get to make them smile. And that__ all I really want in my life is all of them to be happy and to get to celebrate. And that__ what I managed to do for them all today. I've had a lot of tough moments in the beginning of the season. I had great moments _ winning the first race in Australia certainly gave me a big boost. But quite quickly, I had not the best run of results, and Oscar did an incredible job, was consistently ahead of me. It got tricky at times. I think at the end of the day, it shows that consistency over a year is what helps achieve what we've achieved today. But those tricky moments, like everyone says, you__e got to learn from them, acknowledge them, understand them. I've had to go above and beyond in terms of expanding my group, the people I work with on the track, and more so off the track. The amount of people that I have in my corner _ not from McLaren but externally: my friends, my family, my coaches, people that help me think in better ways and perform in better ways. So many people allowed me to go out and be more calm and almost try and not acknowledge the pressure or just perform under pressure and have the second half of the season that I had. If I look back on it, my first half of the season _ not the most impressive. Certainly, times I made some mistakes, made some bad judgments. I made my errors, as I'm sure every driver would admit to. But how I managed to turn all of that and have the second half of the season that I had is what makes me very proud _ that I've been able to prove myself wrong. That I'll find out. You know, I feel proud but not because I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and go, ""I beat everyone."" I'm not proud because I get to just say I'm a world champion. I'm proud because I feel like I made a lot of other people happy. I made my engineer Will, Jarv as well _ they don__ get to see their family much. They've seen me grow up more than they've seen their own kids grow up. I feel bad about that. But the fact that they put so much effort into making me perform and helping us... I'm shaking. Helping us all perform. The fact I get to make them feel like their time has been, hopefully, a little bit worth it__hat's what makes me so happy. I hope it doesn__ change anything I do, the way I think, the way I do things. I believe I won the championship this year my way _ by being a fair driver, by trying to be an honest driver. At times, could I have been more aggressive and got off the brakes and had a few people over? I certainly could have done, and maybe I would need to do more of that in the future. But did I need to do it this year? Is that the way I want to go racing? Is that me? It's not. And I'm sure if you compare me, if that__ what you wanna do, to all the champions: have I been as aggressive as them at times? No. Have I been as daring as them at times? No. But did I do just what I needed to do to win the world championship? Did I perform consistently? Did I perform when I needed to under the most pressure? Post-Zandvoort, did I come back in the way I had to? Did I have three, four weekends of great results? I did. And I performed when I needed to perform to win the World Championship this season. And in the end, that__ what I needed to do. That__ all I needed to do. Of course, I__l learn from everything. Like I said, moments I wish I could go back on and I feel bad for, like Montreal and things like that, I embarrassed myself. But I wish I could go back and change some things. Plenty of moments to learn from. I feel like I'm a better driver now, certainly, than I was at the beginning of the season. But everyone__ going to do it. And when I__ racing against Max, a four-time world champion, when I__ racing against Oscar, a guy who at some point in the future will probably beat me and be a world champion, I__ performing. And I__ having to perform against the best in the world. And I look forward to plenty more times like that. And I need to understand what I can do better, how can I do better, how can I perform more consistently against them and learn from them? And I feel like I did that this year, and I've got to do that even more next year if I want to retain what we've been able to achieve this year. I honestly would just want to say no. It didn__ allow me to relax. Like, when I see 34 points against a guy who's in the same car, who's doing an incredible job, who I know is incredibly quick, that didn__ fill me with confidence. And it wasn__ like, ""I got nothing to lose now, I can just go."" I felt like I was trying to do everything I could before, and I continued to try and do everything I could after. But I just had to step up what I was doing away from the track. Like I said before, the people I was working with, I added more people to that group. I had to work harder both on the simulator and here at track. I had to change my approaches. I had to change my... yeah, like a lot of people do. I had to dig deep and try and understand more things quicker and in a more advanced way than I ever have before. That__ what gave me the advantage I had _ not, ""Oh, the pressure__ off, I can go and do what I__ like to do."" It was really the opposite. I was like, ""Oh, shoot. I__ quite a long way behind against a pretty freaking fast driver, and I__e got to step it up."" And I got to be more myself because of external factors__orking with more professionals in different areas to unlock more of my ability. And I think when you saw that, I had that run of great results, which is ultimately what got me the championship in the end. Look. I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people. This is all for you guys to decide whether someone__ better than someone else or not. All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide he__ better than him, or he__ got a worse car and he__ doing better _ write what you like, decide what you like. I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match. But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No. But you also don__ know, do you? It__ hard to know. Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They__e had an incredible second half of the season. They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I__ very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him. Whether then you want to write whatever you want to write, against him, against me, or whatever it is, feel free. But I__ not here__onestly, like I said at the beginning__y motivation is not here to prove I__ better than someone else. That__ not what makes me happy. I__ not goping to wake up tomorrow and go, ""I__ so happy because I beat Max."" I honestly, deep down, don__ care about that. I don__ care if every article is, ""Do you think he__ better than me?"" or ""Oscar__ better,"" or whatever it is. Doesn__ matter. I have no interest in that. I__e just done what I__e needed to do to win the world championship. That__ it. And I made my people happy. That__ all I really care about at the end of the day. I__ not going to wake up happy tomorrow because I can just go and say to myself, ""I__ world champion."" It might make me smile, but it__ not gonna be the truth. It__ gonna be, ""My mom__ happy. My dad__ happy. My sisters are happy. My brother__ happy. My friends are happy."" And that__ all I need in my life. Honestly, I can__ remember the exact time things started. Certainly levelled up a lot more through the halfway point _ around Zandvoort time _ but it definitely started prior to that. Thank you. End of. Look, again, that__ one of the things that makes me most proud. I feel like I have just managed to win it the way I wanted to win it, which was not by being someone I__ not. Not trying to be as aggressive as Max or as forceful as other champions might have been in the past _ whatever it may be. I__ happy. I just won it my way. I__ happy I could go out and be myself and win it Lando__ way, as Andrea would tell me. That certainly makes me happy. Like I said at the beginning, could I have gone out and been more of that person you probably want me to be at times? I could have done. I would have been less proud about it in some ways. So, that__ why I__ very happy with myself. I kept my cool, I kept to myself, I kept the focus on myself, and I got the most out of how I am. And I know at times I say some stupid things, and I say some things about Max, or I might have said some things at times in the past that everyone talks about, about Lewis. Some things I regret and I wish I could take back and never have come out my mouth. But I honestly believe I give more respect to anyone else than anyone else. I give more respect to Oscar. I give more respect to Max. I try and give as much respect as I can to Lewis__e__ seven-time world champion. He__ the best driver__ou compare him to Schumacher__he best driver that__ ever been in Formula 1. I__ not even close to that. I might never be. I dream of those kind of things. I dreamed of today, and I__e managed to achieve one of seven, comparing to him. And do I regret some of the comments I might have said in cooldown rooms or whatever it is? Yes. But a lot of those are in the heat of the moment. And by the time I__e said it, I__e gone, ""Why the hell did I just say that?"" So, I try and be as genuine as I can. I try and always speak the truth. I never try and give you guys false understandings of things. If I think we__e going to win, I__ going say, ""I think we__e gonna win."" If I think Red Bull are going be fast or probably going to be fast, I__ going to say it. I__ trying to honestly always__ have no gain by trying to hide things from you guys. And, you know, deep down, do I really hate when you write crap about me? I do. It__ also life, and I__e learned to live with some of those things more. And I also value that everyone has their own opinions__hether they like me or not or think someone else is better or not__ike we just spoke about. What I__ happy is that I did things my way this season. I won it in my way, my style of just trying to be a good person and a good team member. And I__ proud about that. No matter what other people want to write about and say about it, no one really knows the truth apart from the people on the inside, in terms of what__ going on. Hell no! It__ way more! This might be my only time__ really hope it__ not, and I am confident it__ not going be my only time of sitting here alone. It__ quite lonely here. No one else sat by my side.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Well, honestly, we maximised everything that we could. We put it on pole, and we won the race. And I think also in the race, we had very strong pace. So, there__ really not much that I could have done different. I think what complicated it a bit was that Oscar was on a different strategy. So, you never know, of course, when he then pits, how much pace he has in hand to catch up again. That also complicates a bit trying to keep the pack together or whatever. But, yeah, overall, just very proud again of the weekend that we had. We put it all out there, and, yeah, the car was actually enjoyable to drive. Yeah. Massive rollercoaster for us. Of course, the first half had some nice moments, but mainly tough moments _ some really tough races and feelings. But I__ also very proud of how we never gave up. And, again, that__ also a lesson for the future, for everyone, that even when it looks like you__e out of it, you never give up. You keep working hard to try and understand your issues, and then you never know what can happen. Winning your first title is something that I think we all dreamt of when you get into the sport. You work for that since you're a little kid. It__ what you dream of. So, when you win your first title, this is very emotional. And, yeah, I hope for Lando as well. You know, I saw a lot of his family is here, so it__ important to enjoy this a lot as well tonight. Also, with his team. I think, again, that__ another story where it showed that even when you have tough years, when you keep working hard, you keep adding good people to the team, you can overcome all of those things, and you can become very successful again. And, yeah, they had an incredible season together, so it__ important that they enjoy it. I had a lot of scenarios in my head, but then, of course, I knew once the tyres Oscar had on the car, that would be quite difficult. I think we were probably a bit too quick up front. The others couldn__ really follow that well. I think Charles drove his heart out today to try and get onto that podium, so that was also impressive to see. But, of course, they went for a two-stop. I think even that made it more complicated because if you stay on a one-stop, backing the whole thing up is tough. And I think this new layout around here makes it even harder to do that compared to 2016 or whatever. It__ been an emotional year. Forget about the results this year. I also don__ want to go too much into detail, but it__ been tough. But I__ very happy to be able to work with someone that passionate. Of course, he is my race engineer, but I see him as my friend. We have lived through so many emotional things together and fantastic achievements. I__ sure he was a bit emotional after the flag. So, I__ really looking forward to leaving here and catching up with him because it__ not been easy at times for him. I__ just very proud to be able to work with someone that good. A proper example of someone that never gave up this season, even through the difficult times. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I have no regrets about my season. I think the performance has been strong. I've hated this car at times, but I've also loved it at times. And I always tried to extract the most from it, even in the difficult weekends that we__e had. But, yeah, it's been, like I said before, a proper rollercoaster with the car. Luckily, the last, I would say, eight, nine rounds in general have been a lot more enjoyable. And also, in the team, we have a great atmosphere at the moment. We__e really on a roll _ positive energy, belief, confidence _ and that__ exactly what you want heading into next year. I just kept looking on the screen to see if something would pop up. Yeah, I mean, the race itself went really well, and I was just enjoying sitting in the car and driving it. And every straight you keep looking if something happens, but at the same time, that's part of racing. So I was not really too fussed about it. I mean, at the end of the day, of course, it__ always nicer to win it. But, honestly, I__ sitting here now with probably a better feeling than what I had last year at this time because the second half of last year was pretty tricky at times as well. So, we have been struggling for, I would say, a year _ the second half of last year and the first half of this year. But I actually feel a lot better now. Of course, shame to miss out on the title, but at the same time, for a long period of time I was not even thinking about the title. I never felt like I was in it until a few rounds ago. That__ pretty crazy. But, yeah, you take your pride in different ways. I__ happy with myself and going into next year I__ not in a state of having to worry about my skills or whatever. So, yeah, I feel good. You forget all the other stuff that happened in my season. The only thing you mention is Barcelona. I knew that would come. You__e giving me a stupid grin now. I don__ know. Yeah, it__ part of racing at the end. You live and learn. The championship is one of 24 rounds. I__e also had a lot of early Christmas presents given to me in the second half, so you can also question that.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"I think, honestly, pretty good. There wasn__ anything left out there. Obviously, we tried a bit of a gamble on the strategy to give ourselves some different options and hope that the stars aligned to give ourselves the best chance. But ultimately, in the end, that didn__ happen. So, yeah, I think given as well I missed a practice session, it took a little bit to find my feet. I think that was the maximum we could have achieved today. We didn__ have an answer for Max__ pace. So pretty happy with the weekend. Not much more we could have done. Yeah. I mean, I think, obviously, I would have wished for a slightly different ending, but I think this year I__e learned a hell of a lot about myself as a race car driver, myself as a person. I think if you had presented this season at the start of the year with the pole positions and the wins and the podiums, I definitely would have been pretty happy with that. And I think even in the tough moments, I__e learned a lot about myself and how I can be stronger in the future. So, I think, ultimately, there__ a little bit of disappointment, obviously, but I think I can be very proud of the season I__e had and plenty of lessons to take to the future. I think a very deserving winner. I know that every weekend I go on track, it__ going to be tough. And I think we__e pushed each other through the last three years. I think especially this season has been tighter than ever. So, yeah, I think he__ had a great season. Probably all three of us, but obviously, myself and Lando in the same team, in the same car, have had our ups and downs at different moments. Ultimately, I think he__ had a good season and a deserving champion. Definitely. I mean, comparing different parts of different people__ careers is always difficult with different cars and stuff. But I think definitely I can be very proud of the season I__e had. When I look at this season compared to my first two years in F1, this year has been head and shoulders above the first two. Ultimately, whilst the end result is not quite what I wanted, there__ a lot of optimism and a lot of strength that I__e gained from proving to myself what I can achieve through this season. Those are the kinds of things that are not necessarily tied to results. So I think for me, I can definitely take that forward into the future. It__ only my third attempt at this in F1. Hopefully, I__e got plenty more to go, but there are definitely lessons from this year that will only make me stronger. Ultimately both, I think. There__e definitely been lessons directly to do with how I drive the car, how I can be better in different conditions, and just become a better all-round driver. There have also been lessons outside the car _ dealing with adversity, dealing with difficult moments. I__e learned a lot about myself in those kinds of things. So, there have been lessons both in and out of the car that will definitely help me for the future. Yeah, it__ nice having another summer break. I__ going back to Australia for a little bit, see my family and friends, give my annual hellos and goodbyes. I__ looking forward to some time away from racing, to be honest. It__ been a long, demanding season. As enjoyable as driving the fastest cars in the world is, a break now and again is always a nice thing. So, I__ just looking forward to not thinking about race cars and spending time with people around me. Then obviously, the new season is not far away, so it__ going to be important to enjoy that time off and then come back refreshed with the new challenges for next year. Oh yes, I am. Yeah, it was nice that the boys could wrap it up before the race started. Hopefully, I will get to some cricket _ ideally Boxing Day, given it__ in Melbourne. I mean, there__ part of me that kind of wants the series to still be alive by that point, and part of me that really doesn__. So I__l take whatever we can get. It__ been enjoyable to watch for the last couple of weeks. I think there are similarities, yes. The emotions you feel are more or less the same. I think what__ different in F1, when I compare it to the junior championships, is the length. The longest junior championship I had was ten rounds. This one has been two and a half times that. The duration you have to live through is much more. My F2 season, for example, was eight rounds., So I think that part is quite different. And I think just the stakes are a little bit different as well. In the junior categories, you obviously want to win the championship, but you__e trying to make your case for why you should be in F1. I think we__e seen through the years _ Max is probably the perfect example _ you don__ need to win championships to demonstrate your capabilities for F1. Whereas when you get to F1, there__ nothing more than becoming champion. So that aspect is a bit different, but, yeah, there are also some similarities. No, I don__ think so. I don__ think that will change anything. For me, he__ obviously had a great season this year and a deserving champion, but he__ still Lando Norris. It__ not like he__ become Superman. So, I don__ think things will change with that. I__ expecting full fairness from the team and equality going forward. I don__ have any concerns that that will change at all. Clearly, Lando__ had a very strong season this year, and ultimately did a better job. I think it is a testament to the way we go racing. Obviously, it__ not easy fighting for both the Constructors_ Championship and the Drivers_ Championship with two very evenly matched drivers. But ultimately, that__ a problem we knew we were going to have. At the end of the day, I think there__ a lot of good things that come from that. Yes, there__ difficult moments and tension at times, but I think both Lando and I have become better drivers from pushing each other to the limit. Sometimes that__ been uncomfortable for everyone, but ultimately, yeah, it__ been a good thing. We__e had a lot of discussions through the year, and I__ sure we__l have discussions in the off-season about anything we want to do slightly differently for next year. But I think at the end of the day, they gave us both as good a chance as the team could have to fairly fight for a world championship, and that__ all you can ask for.",Abu Dhabi,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Well, in Q2 I stayed on scrubbed tyres and I think those laps already felt quite decent. And then in Q3 around here, you know, the track temp is coming down. You know that you can push a bit more and that's exactly what we did. We found a bit more lap time and, of course, incredibly happy to be in first. That's the only thing that we can do, right? That's the only thing that we can control, try to just maximise everything we have and then do what we can with the car _ and we definitely did that in qualifying. Yeah. You have to try and guess a little bit how much the track is going to improve. Of course, it cools down a lot. But you're never like 100% sure if it's going to work. But I do think that what we changed definitely helped me a little bit more to feel better in qualifying. We'll find out tomorrow, won't we? Let's see what we can do. Of course, I'll try to win the race, but also in the back of my mind, we want to try and score a lot of points to still try and win that championship. So, we need a bit of luck from what is happening behind us. Yeah, I think in general, qualifying felt a little bit more together compared to the other sessions, where I always felt like we were still lacking a little bit. But then I think with the final changes that we made going into the night, that seemed to help us a bit. And then throughout qualifying, just improving nicely. In Q2, of course, I was on scrubbed tyres, and to be honest, I was a little bit surprised on the first run how much the new tyres actually gave me. But yeah, it was a good lap already, with a little bit of help also from Yuki with a tow. So, that was very nice of him to give up one of his runs. And then the second lap, I was not sure if I was going to improve just because of the tow that I got. But then again, just found a little bit more lap time in the corners, and that gave me a little bit more lap time. So happy with that, happy with the one-lap performance at the end in qualifying. Now, of course, the big question mark is can we keep that up in the race. I would hope so. I mean, I actually did a lot of laps in the long run, so we tried to prepare in the best way possible. It's probably the best I have felt, but of course, let's see if that's good enough. Of course, I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it. I'm going to try to win that race. But of course, with that, I still need a little bit of help or luck to win the championship. But we'll see how that goes tomorrow. To think about that tonight? No. We'll figure it out tomorrow, not tonight. I mean, it's like talking about strategy__ou can talk about it for one hour, two hours, and then normally after one lap, you throw it in the bin. So, yeah, a lot can go well for you, can go against you, and we'll find out tomorrow. Normally, it always improves a bit. It's quite natural throughout the weekend. But still, I think everyone in the long runs was graining their right front, and at the same time, the rears are also not on holiday. So yeah, I think we will all struggle with the same thing__ut some a bit more than others. Just being able to put it all together. Sometimes that__ oversteer, sometimes that__ understeer. Just depends a little bit on the corner layout. And every session you try different things__ome bits are positive, some bits are negative. And then over the practice sessions, you make a call on what you want for qualifying. That__ what we did, and finally most of the corners came together. Yeah. It was also a different layout. I feel like now you get towed around a lot more around the lap, so it__ probably not as easy to do something like that. Cars also are completely different to back then. I felt like it was a lot easier back then to back it up because the tyres would overheat a lot when you would get close. I remember even in 2016, in some qualifying laps, you couldn__ go flat out in Sector 1 to keep the tyres alive in the last sector__hich actually was here, for example. So yeah, very different times. I hope it__ not straightforward, the race__ut hopefully that__ not because of me! Yeah. It felt really good, and of course there was quite a bit of pressure trying to do the best we could. It felt probably similar to 2021 qualifying__ had a really good qualifying here as well. But I like that. When the pressure is the highest or when you really need to perform, normally I perform because I enjoy that kind of aspect. But yeah, it was nice. You always try to do the best possible quali lap. Sometimes it works out better than other times. I think this time it worked out pretty well. All out. I have nothing to lose. So for me, of course, I__ going to try to win the race. I__ going to defend. If I need to attack, I__l attack, because what can happen? You__e either second or third _ or you win. That would be fantastic.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"It's tough. I mean, Max did a good job, so congrats to him. We did everything we could. I think my lap was pretty good. I was pretty happy. So yeah, of course disappointed to not be on pole for the final weekend, but we were just not running fast enough today. So, we'll have to try do it tomorrow. I don't know. The time will come when I think of that. But for now, you know, disappointed to not be on pole, and I still want to try win tomorrow. So that's going to be the goal. Yeah. I think Q1, Q2, not the smoothest. My Q3 laps, I was pretty happy with, honestly. So yeah, I felt pretty good. I felt like I got a lot out of the car today, but it just wasn't enough. So, a bit disappointed because you just want to be on pole for the final race of the year. But we just didn__ have the pace today. So, I felt like I got the maximum out of the car, and I have to be happy with that. Of course, behind the one person I kind of want to be ahead of__hat__ the only reason for the disappointment. But otherwise, I was pretty happy with my laps, and yeah, it was the maximum we could do. No, it didn__. Bits. I think we weren__ in the best position on Friday. I think we've improved in quite a few areas since then. And race pace, you know, normally we're pretty strong. But like Oscar said, Max__ pace was also very strong. So yeah, I think today when you look at it, we weren__ quite quick enough. But of course, we'll hope we can turn some of that around tomorrow. I'll decide when I have to. Max summed it up pretty well. I think the track certainly improves always into qualifying. Probably not as much as we might have thought considering yesterday, with where the fuel loads we were at, things like that. It was already a 23.0, I think. So, we didn__ really go that much quicker today with a lot less fuel. So I maybe would have hoped for a bit more from us today in quali performance. But lately, our quali performances have been something that have been a bit more on the back foot rather than the races. So yeah, like Max says, I think everyone struggled with similar things. But generally, people try and work on those things as much as possible into FP3 and so forth. And normally, the grip coming up then also helps that into Sunday. No idea. I expect everything, so we__l wait and see. No. I mean, I'm always a bit nervous before quali. It's more excitement than anything else. But apart from Q1, I felt pretty good out there. So no, I felt pretty normal. I mean, it feels a bit different, just because it's the final race of the year, not because of anything else. I felt pretty normal into Sunday last week. I didn__ really have the expectation that I was going to get the championship because I started P3 and just didn__ really expect it. Or P2. So no, I felt good then, I feel good now. I feel comfortable and ready to go. I feel like we__e got a good plan for things. But as Max said, you can__ plan for everything. So no, I feel good. I feel excited to get the final race done and then go on holiday. Yeah. Oscar said it well. It__ not a conversation that needs to be had, and I think we both understand each other and are respectful enough of one another. I think we both understand that no one would do anything in a bad way to make the other feel worse. We both respect what we do every single weekend, every quali, every race. We go out and race together. But that__ the same off the track__e're two different guys that get along, and that__ all we need. I don't mind either. I__e been in both positions, I guess. I felt good in both. I performed in both. So yeah, I__ not too bothered to be the hunter or the hunted. I think normally to be hunted is fine because you__e normally the one with the advantage in the first place, so that__ good. And of course, I would sign for that now but life__ not that simple, sadly. So, I__ still going to go into tomorrow and we are still going to plan for how we can win the race, whether it__ on pace or strategy or whatever it may be. That__ all going to be our plan tomorrow, and that__ how I want to end the season__tanding on top. So, nothing changes from that side. I mean, it__ not something you decide now, honestly. It__ something that you'll see and decide before the start of the race and five metre s before you brake into Turn 1. Until then, I think everyone just wants to get the maximum out of it for themselves.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. I mean, I think it was pretty good. I think the lap I did in Q1, it was nice to finally get into a rhythm through the weekend. And honestly, I think the last lap in Q3 was pretty good as well. There wasn't a whole lot left in that. No, just not quite quick enough today. But yep, sets up a pretty exciting day tomorrow. We'll find out tomorrow. I think Max has looked very quick in the long runs this weekend and clearly very quick over one lap. But yeah, let's see how much pace is a factor tomorrow. I think overall, pretty happy. I feel like Q1, that was the first lap that was actually good for the weekend, which was nice to have it at the right time. And then I think the laps in Q3 were pretty good as well. You know, the tiny little margins that you always have on a qualifying lap were probably there, but I didn__ have an answer for Max__ pace today. So ultimately, pretty happy. Would have loved a bit more, but we didn__ have it. Difficult to know. I've not done that much long running, obviously only FP2, but it looked okay without being anything spectacular. So yeah, I would have loved the long runs to have gone a bit better, but we're here now, and we'll see how the conditions and the track evolve. Yes. Funny things can happen. That__ what I've learned. Turn 1, I don't know, but I'll have someone stand by. Yeah. I don't have much to add. I think it has gripped up quite a bit. I think for everyone, it was probably a bit worse than expected. So, we'll see what that looks like tomorrow. I don't know. Handshake would be good, probably. I don__ know. I haven't... I don't know what exactly is expected of me yet. But until either Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I__e still got a chance of winning the title. So yeah, we__l see how the race pans out. I__ sure we will talk about it. Yes. I think it makes a lot of sense to talk about that one before the race. I don__ think you need to have any discussions about things like that. One of us could win our first championship in F1__ou__e obviously going to celebrate that. I think we've got more than enough respect between each other to appreciate the work of the person that loses tomorrow, and there__ going to be nothing but respect either way. Also, whoever's on the losing side _ it would be unfair to expect the person who__ won to not celebrate. So, I don__ think you need any conversations. I think we__e adults and got enough respect between us to know what__ right. Yeah. I mean, from where I'm sat, I need things to happen in the race to win the championship. So, I__l wait and see if those things happen.",Abu Dhabi,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Well, we have ideas of what we could have tested. Whether these are the solutions is another story. So, we don't have the 100% solution to it, but we've got ideas of what we didn't try during that weekend. And, obviously, we're clearly doing something wrong during the weekend, as we weren't strong from FP1 to the race. So yeah, we have ideas. Whether we have the clear solution, I don't think so. No. Surely, it's been accentuated by the fact that Qatar was never going to be a track where we would be strong. But we didn__ perform at the level we should be anyway. So yeah, we should have done better even though the characteristics of the track were not good for us. But for this weekend, I expect us to be back to where we should be, which is probably third team or something like that. Personally, I'm quite satisfied. I think it's been a strong season on my side. You always try to improve from one season to the other, and that's what I've tried to do this year. And I'm satisfied with the work. Then, unfortunately, the performances are not where they should be, and I'm not as satisfied about the result side of things and the performance we've shown. Especially after last year that we ended up strong, the expectation was another one. But yeah, we've pushed. I think we reacted well as a team from the first race to the last race, trying to turn that situation around. It wasn't easy because we didn__ have that many upgrades, as we are focusing mostly on 2026. But yeah, I think we performed well as a team on track. Then what we are missing eventually is the performance on the car. And for that, I hope that next year will be better. I don't know. Again, I've changed my mind so many times this year. I thought it was Oscar, then I thought it was Max, then I don't know. I probably think it's going to be Lando. Twelve points is still significant. So, if nothing big happens to Lando, I think Lando will take it. Well, I don't know how competitive we'll be this weekend. I think, at least for us, we expect McLaren to be extremely strong this weekend, then probably Red Bull, and then Mercedes and ourselves. Whether there will be at one point some interaction between the McLarens or the Red Bull and ourselves, I'm pretty sure there will be at one point. But I'm not here to think about any of that. I'll just do absolutely everything in order to maximise my race and then it__ up to them to the do the best job and try and get the championship, whoever the world champion will be, but that won__ be part of my thought process in my race for sure. Well, I'd rather just win the race and have nothing to do with the way they fight for the championship. That's one way to look at it. But again, whether I'm fighting for second, third, fourth, or whichever position I find myself in, whoever is behind, I'll just fight him the same way just because I want to maximise that last race, and I'm fighting for my team. So again, there's nothing of that title battle that will cross my mind, because I just want to maximise my car potential. So yeah, I'll fight as hard for whoever is behind or in front and try to maximise our result. I agree. I think for us there's not only one reason. There are many reasons which, at different times, played a role. In the beginning of _22, we actually started off quite strongly, but we were struggling with porpoising, where Red Bull had a very stable platform. And they were actually quite a lot overweight, so as soon as they took off that weight, they were suddenly at the level where they've been since then. And then for last year, we focused very early on next year__ car, which I hope is a bet that will be a winning one. But for sure, it has some influence from the last two thirds of the season where we've been struggling more than others because we didn't bring that many upgrades. But in general, it's just been a generation of car that was very, very difficult to understand. And what worked back at the factory _ I think everybody has been surprised once or more times that when you bring it on track, it doesn't correlate exactly to what you were expecting from that part. And that was the challenge of it. And yeah, and other teams did better, especially McLaren and Red Bull. I think as a driver, obviously the first few years in F1, it was very clear what I had to work on because the weaknesses when you arrive in Formula 1 are much bigger. So it's very easy to target only one thing you want to improve, and that was race management and tyre management in my first few years. Then you improve those things, and then it's all about the details. And the experience you get in Formula 1 helps you to fine-tune the little things you want to get better at. So there's not one main lesson I will take from this year to next year _ just many more little lessons that you keep in mind and try to fine-tune and get better at. Yeah, I don't have much more to add apart from that. It's unacceptable. And obviously, those people face no consequence for their words and for their disrespect towards drivers. So yeah, it's not up to us to think about the consequences that they should endure, but it's a big shame because, as they said, we__e all here trying to do our absolute best. We've done racing since we were kids, dreaming of being in that position, and today we're doing absolutely everything in order to be at the limit. And sometimes mistakes happen. In that particular case, also, the hate was for absolutely nothing. So yeah, I mean, I didn__ speak with Kimi. The only thing that you can do in those kinds of moments is to ignore everything that is happening, but that__ obviously very hard _ especially when you are... I remember my first or second year in F1, you kind of look sometimes on social media at what's being said around you, or at least that was the case for me, and that makes it even more difficult. So yeah, then I think with experience you kind of get used to it, but we shouldn__ really have to get used to this kind of behaviour, and I hope that one day it will be tackled properly. Well, not so much because we were at a technical disadvantage from the first race. So, it's not like it changed massively our approach to the season. And we saw it relatively quickly that we wouldn't be fighting for the world title because McLaren was too strong, Red Bull was obviously starting to make big gains, it wasn't very much of a point to put all our resources into trying to take the third or second place _ if everything was going super well _ in the Constructors', at the cost of next year, whichever cost it may be. So yeah, it__ never something you want to do. I would have much preferred pushing the development the whole year to try and clinch that world title, 100%. But if you are in the position that we were in at the beginning of the year, I think it was kind of a no-brainer. So, I don__ regret it.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Ferrari
Isack Hadjar,"Yeah. It's a very good moment in my career, that's for sure. For all the hard work through the years being rewarded now. Obviously, it's just the beginning of a new journey, but yeah, I'm very excited and stepping into a new era of Formula 1 as well. I think it's a very good timing. Yeah, it was, again, like, there was no very cool phone call where I pick up the phone and it__ like __eah, you're a Red Bull Racing driver,_ you know? It's not really how it worked. Ha! It was just a talk with Helmut I had. He made me understand I was driving for Red Bull, and I had to deliver. That__ it. Yeah, I have no expectations at all because it's starting from scratch, everyone. So yeah, the work is going to be done. I'm just really looking forward to January, February, working with the team, getting to know all the people. Yeah. It's going to be crucial to try and be ahead a bit. Lando. I mean, I won't be racing any of these guys this weekend, to be honest. It's more like a traditional track. I think what Charles said about the ranking of the car performances makes sense. So we won't be there to disturb their fight, that's for sure. Well, it's not true. It__ not the same car at all next year. So that__ it. We're going to get the car we have. The team is going to build this car. I have to adapt to that car, and Max will have to do the same job. And if the car goes into one direction, at least I'll be there to feel the change. And ideally, I contribute to that change. So, you know, that would be the ideal scenario. And, you know, I've never repeated every year. I've always competed in different cars, so I don't know what it's like doing twice the same thing, the same job. So I think I'm pretty decent at adapting, so I'm actually confident. I can't tell you, but let's say I found out very late. Let's say, Qatar race week. And, I mean, if that__ the line-up for next year, then I think they chose it because it makes sense. And, of course, because it's a new regulation, so the timing is just very ideal for me. And then in terms of styles, I think obviously Max is very unique _ he has a very unique style _ and I would say myself as well. So I'm not obviously trying to copy what he's doing. But in terms of mindset, we have some things in common. But yeah, that's it. What I find very impressive with Max is that after four world championships, he's still very, very hungry and very mad when it doesn't go his way, because he always wants to win. And, you know, I don't think every champion can do that. Once you pass a certain level, you can maybe slow down a bit in your approach, but he seems to be starving, just like I am. So, it's very impressive. Wait, what was the first part of the question? Honestly, there's two things _ being in a world champion team. When I grew up watching Formula 1, I saw Vettel winning all these races, as a kid, with Red Bull. And being team-mates with Max, to see what it's like _ what facing the best level in the world feels like. You know, it's definitely super-exciting. And a race in Africa is going to happen at some time. That__ for sure. It's going to take a moment, but it's going to happen. Yeah, I think Abu Dhabi is probably the track I've driven the most in my career. I__e done, honestly, a lot of laps here. So, I think it's the only track probably on the calendar where I drove an F1 car before _ apart from Mexico. So yeah, for once, I definitely feel like there's not a lot to learn. Sometimes I know a track really well, but I've only done it in lower categories, and the step to F1 is obviously huge. So, everything feels very different. But now, yeah, for sure it's going to help. But at the end of the day, it's three free practice sessions. You're going to reach the limits quite early in the weekend, and then it's all fine-tuning. I haven't spoken to Kimi, but it's just unfair, especially when you're giving your absolute maximum during your race to bring it home _ I think it was fourth. You make a mistake, and then there are all these things said about you online. I think it's just very unfair because you give your absolute maximum, and then it seems like you did this mistake on purpose, which I think is very not nice. And yeah, people behind their keyboards, like George said, are just idiots. They all know nothing about racing _ never drove ever in their life _ so that's the only reason why they comment.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,RB
George Russell,"They sent a pigeon with a note. It's another race, to be honest. Obviously, we want to try and secure P2 in the Constructors_ Championship. It was a bit of a shame we couldn't achieve that in Qatar, but we have a very good shot this weekend and just go out and enjoy the last race of the season. I think, yeah, thanks to Isack, I had quite a long race in traffic. No, I think, unfortunately, we were very competitive. I think it was only really Oscar who was more competitive. I think, nine times out of ten when you are very competitive, the result is there. And I think, unfortunately, this was the one out of ten times when you do have the car, and unfortunately, it doesn't go the way you hope. And I think that lap seven Safety Car, starting on the inside _ I think every driver in the first four rows who started on the inside lost at least one position _ so that just compromised the whole weekend. No, I think both seasons were very strong. I'd say this season, without doubt, has been my most competitive. I think 2022 was really challenging, experiencing porpoising for the first time and the challenges we were going through as a team and also my first year against Lewis. But I think, yeah, this has been a strong year. Lando. I don't think it's acceptable or reasonable to ask a driver who's also in a shot of a championship in the very last race to move over for your team-mate. I think if it were, you know, in other seasons gone by _ let's just say, you know, Checo and Max or Barrichello and Schumacher _ when clearly one driver is the one going for the championship, and if in the last race, the guy who doesn't have a shot of winning the championship moves over, that is absolutely reasonable. And I think every single driver would do that. But for me, I don't think it would be fair at all. I think they both need to be given a shot. And if they lose out because of it, you just need to say the other guy did a better job, and that's racing. That's how it should be. Well, I think McLaren have been so strong here the last few years. I think they were on pole and won the last couple of years, and it hasn't been our strongest track. But if we are in the mix, again, it's not really our problem. We're going out there to have the best race possible. I'm not going to risk any more or any less than any other race. For me, it's one race of 24. It's the last race of the season, but I treat every single one the same. Well, I haven't seen the press release, so I can't comment on what was said there. I think it was agreed that nothing would change for the rest of this season, which I do think is correct. We've always asked for consistency, and it would be unfair to change that approach now. But I think the general consensus is always _ guidelines need to be taken as guidelines. And we want the best Stewards, the best racing knowledge to judge certain incidents based upon their own experience. And I think that was clear when you put 20 F1 drivers in a room reviewing _ I don't know how many we reviewed, six or seven incidents _ we all agreed upon what the penalty should have been or not, regardless of what the guidelines said. So yeah, I hope there's a follow-up and look forward to hearing what they're thinking ahead of 2026. Yeah. Exactly the same. I think it's been an extremely challenging set of regs, to be honest. And obviously, this second half of the year, Red Bull have been on a very high level. But if I were to answer that question at the summer break, I would have argued that we were at a similar level to Red Bull. And if you compare that to _23 _ Aston Martin were ahead of ourselves and Ferrari and dropped off, McLaren were nowhere and obviously just found something pretty spectacular. So, I can't really answer that question _ what it is we've missed. I think it's probably more where we started. I think we probably started in the wrong place and led ourselves down the wrong path and then had to revert. And clearly Red Bull, out of the blocks, had the least amount of porpoising in _22 and almost had a six- or eight-month head start on everybody while we were trying to work that out. So, I don't think this regulation is really going to have any impact on the next set of regs, because the issues are going to be totally different. Yeah, I think it's pretty unacceptable what happened and what was written and the abuse online. Obviously, it all started with a mistake from the Red Bull guys, and of course, they apologised, and that's okay. People make a mistake, especially when you don't have the full facts. But I think those thousands of people behind their keyboards have no excuse and really need to take a hard look at themselves in the mirror and think why that is acceptable _ not just for F1, but just society altogether. I just struggle to comprehend it, really. So that's all I can say.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Sure. Same as every weekend. Nothing changed. Of course, just some reviews of last weekend, like the same after every weekend really__eview what went on, what was clearly and obviously not good for us, some of the mistakes we__e made, and also the less obvious things that we could improve on. But that__ normal post-race understandings and therefore preparations for the next race. But otherwise, nothing does change. I mean, it gets treated the same from everyone inside the team. Just more excitement, I guess, for everyone at the same time. But apart from that, the work and how you approach it all remains the same I mean, there__ always little things along the way. Of course, there are probably some more obvious ones from my side. You know, if I go back to Canada, probably being the most like __ust put my hands up in the air__ messed up_. It cost me a good amount of points. Yeah. China, I__e been unlucky in qualifying. And then just some little things along the way. It's probably like that for everyone. There certainly is for everyone. Otherwise, there__ some other bits where, probably the same for all of us here, at times, you get a bit unlucky, whether it was the DNF in Zandvoort or the disqualification. That__ not unlucky. That__ just not doing a good enough job as a team. But the disqualification in Vegas as well cost me a good amount of points. So yeah, I wouldn__ say anything obvious. It was just a couple of parts from my side that I have to put my hands up and admit I didn__ do a very good job. And then a couple from us as a team where we have to admit we also didn__ do a good enough job, including last weekend. But that__ probably about it. A mix. I mean, it__ end of season. Every year I invite some of my friends because they__e just as important as the rest in terms of _ a lot of my friends support me every weekend, support me every week, cheer for me. I always lean on my friends for advice and help in different moments. So yeah, win or lose, end of the season, it__ always nice to share it with them. But I do that every year, so it__ nothing special from that point of view. And my parents come to many races, and they__e here again because it__ the final one _ not because of it being a good one or a bad one or whatever it may be. They come to the final race of the season every time. So, a little mix, but no, I want them to be there because it__ a moment again, win or lose, it__ a moment where I just want to share every bit that I can with my friends, with my family, because it__ also fun for them. Well, everyone__ going to say each other, so... Same. No. Not been discussed. And honestly, I mean, I would love it, but I don__ think I would ask it. Because_ I don__ know, it__ up to Oscar if he would allow it, you know? I don__ think it__ necessarily down to me. It__ the same if it__ the other way around. Would I be willing to or not? Personally, I think I would just because I feel like I__ always like that, and that__ just how I am. But yeah, it__ not really up to me. I__ not going to ask it. I don__ want to ask it because I don__ think it__ necessarily a fair question. And at the same time, if that__ how it ends and Max wins, then well, that__ it. Congrats to him and I look forward to next year. It doesn__ change anything. It doesn__ change my life. So, he will deserve it over us. Umm_. Yeah, there__ just so many to choose from. I think what I like about him is just his general attitude of how he approaches everything. Always, I mean, I said it a few weeks ago, but just always pretty calm, pretty relaxed in every situation, stays cool. That__ something I admire and I think is something that at times I wish I was a little bit more like. But, you know, everyone does their own thing. You always try and find what works best for you. But there__ still things from every driver, even when I was growing up, that you admire in them, don__ like in them, whatever it may be, you know? But I think also the most important thing is just how you get on personally. I__e always got on well with my team-mates. It__ easy not to. It takes one decision to make everything not be the way it is. And I think that__ something we__e done well. It obviously makes our life hard as a team because we have two drivers fighting for a championship instead of one, and that also has its complications at times and its difficulties. Allows for other parties to enter the chat more often. But we__e still happy that we__e both up there. And I think how we__e worked together, how we just treat each other, whether it__ on the track, off the track, whatever it may be, is just a good way of approaching everything, I think. Not everyone would agree with it, which is completely acceptable and understandable. But I think we both have a similar approach in terms of just wanting to go on track, prove who__ better, try and drive the quickest, but also come off and enjoy our life when the helmet__ off. When it__ just us as people, us as personalities. And I think that__ something that I have a lot of respect for, and I enjoy. I think I__l look back on it in ten years_ time and say the same thing. Similar. I mean, my mom does many things _ different shoes, odd-coloured shoes, whatever, she does a lot of different stuff. She doesn__, I think, do anything that I know of that__ like Max said. But yeah, she also tells me similar things: stay away from the others and be careful. I guess it__ just a different mentality. You know, like Max__ mom was a racing driver, so I think she understands probably more than our moms might do. So, I think they get maybe a bit more scared because they don__ understand everything that goes on quite as well. But yeah, I love my mom, so it__ good. Similar. I know I__e obviously not been in this situation before, so pretty different, I guess, for both of us. But at the minute, I feel good. Like, I really don__ think of it at all until you guys ask it all the time. So, it__ trying to avoid you guys as much as possible! But that__ also part of the job. So it__ nothing new. It__ nothing that shocks me. Whatever. I come into the weekend not thinking of it. For the last three days, just playing some golf and being with my mates and having a good time. And I look forward to doing that on Monday, whether I__ hungover or not. So, yeah, really it is the same, and I think it__l be the same on track as how I__e been the last few weeks. As much as there__ been pressure the last few weeks, I__e still felt comfortable and I still feel good in the car. So, just yeah. All good. Nothing more to add. I don__ think Zak or Andrea would let us even if we wanted to. So, no. It__ the same as every weekend. I guess in terms of position, of course, I have the most to lose because I am the one at the top. Yeah. And I__l do my best to stay there till the end of the year, a few more days. At the same time, if it doesn__ go my way, then I try again next year. It__l hurt probably for a little while, but then, yeah, that__ life. I__l crack on and try and do better next season. So, I also feel like I have the mentality of ""I have nothing to lose,"" because it__ just a race for a championship. But in 30 years_ time, I probably won__ think of it that much either way. So, I__ not too bothered. I__l do the best I can. If it happens, great. If it doesn__, then I__l try again next year. I don__ know. Ask me, hopefully, in a few days or a few weeks then. I think this has been my whole life. It's everything I've worked towards my whole life. So, it would mean the world to me. It would mean the world to everyone that__ supported me and pushed me for the last, what is it, like 16 years of my life in terms of trying to get to this point. So, it would mean everything. It would mean my life until now has been a success, and I__e accomplished that dream I had when I was a kid. Other than that, I don__ know what else to say. It__ a reward for a lot of hard work that goes into things, and I think it goes to whoever deserves it the most.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Spent some time with my daughter, figured some stuff out for GT3 for next year, figured out some stuff for my sim team as well, planning for next year. So, yeah, just pretty straightforward stuff before arriving here, to be honest. At the end of the day, of course, it__ one over 24 races. Some races go a bit better than others. A lot of the races we didn__ have a lot of pace or enough pace to challenge for a win, but here we are. So, in general, I__ just very proud of the season that we__e done, how we've come back as well in the second half. So yeah, we__l just try and keep it fun now __il the end. But yeah, to always pinpoint on one particular moment is a hard one. No. Parents are not here. My dad is rallying in Africa. And my mom_ Yeah, I guess it was not planned. I also didn__ really plan to be in the title fight till the end. So, yeah, here we are. Yeah, I think after Zandvoort everything was a bit cancelled, I would say. My mom is at home happy with the dogs. So yeah. You can see a lot on TV anyway. We are not like that. They know that when I sit in the car, I will give everything I have. I just speak to them about other stuff. So, they don__ need to motivate me. That doesn__ really work like that. But of course, they always support me, you know? My mom always lights a candle before every race weekend. But yeah, I guess they trust their son. Yeah. Just the timing. You want me a long answer or not? I just__hat you want from a teammate? Good in also developing the car with the team. Good understanding between the drivers. Friendly, funny, open-minded, not hiding things throughout the weekend between the two drivers. So, yeah, in general, just trying to push the team forward. I think that__ the most important. If you are good friends off track, that__ a nice bonus but not necessarily needed, as long as you are very professional on track and it benefits the team. I__ very relaxed. Nothing to lose, you know? So, I__ just enjoying being here. But for me, it__ not even about being here. I__e been enjoying the second half of the season, working with the team, how we__e been able to turn it around from difficult times and really having a debrief after the race, being very disappointed and frustrated with the performances to just enjoying, smiling. Having these wins again is fantastic. So, I just take it _ everything here is just a bonus, sitting here fighting for the title. So that__ also what makes it very straightforward for me. We will just try to have a good weekend. But then even then, it__ not really in my control, you know? So we just, yeah, like I said, try to enjoy it. I mean, trophy looks the same. You know, I have four of those at home, so it__ nice to add a fifth. Yeah. I mean, I know my signature, so it__ the same. But yeah, I mean, of course you always try to win it. But at the same time, I__e already achieved everything that I wanted to achieve in F1, and everything is just a bonus. And I just keep doing it because I love it and I enjoy it. And that__ also how I go into this weekend__ave a good time out there, try to maximise the result. And even with that, maximising the result? I don__ even know what that means in terms of where you are in the ranking, you know? Because realistically, I don__ think we are the quickest. But you never know. A lot of things can happen__ike it did also in Qatar. So we__l just see. Maybe use the fifth one_ or the fourth. They all run. So, we'll see. It doesn't matter. I mean, they all work. So that's the most important.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"I mean, I wasn__ organising GT3 teams, but I played some padel, and just treated it like normal. Obviously, there__ not that many days in between. Had a marketing day, so that was good fun, and that__ been about it. Yeah, I mean, there are a few moments to choose from, I__ say, unfortunately. But I think for everyone, there__ always moments, and no season is ever going to be perfect. So, I think it's not particularly useful picking out __ lost this amount of points here, this amount of points there,"" because everyone__ lost a certain amount of points at some point along the way. But yeah, definitely on my side of things, there__ been a few races or a few moments I__ like to have again. Same thing as the team, I__ sure. But yeah, picking one__ don__ think there__ one that__ hurt more than others. Yeah, my family is here. Kind of similar to Lando in some ways. It__ the last race. I__e done a lot of racing without any of my family and friends in my career, so it is always nice to have them there. But it doesn__ change the world, let__ say. It is nice, obviously, but I know some people actually prefer it when their parents aren__ there or they don__ have people around. But for me, it is a nice thing. To be honest with you, I don__ even know which engine I__e got in or when we changed it or whatever. So, no, I__ not concerned. Rachel asked it to Lando! It__ not something we__e discussed. So, yeah. I mean, until I know what__ kind of expected_ I don__ really have an answer until I know what__ expected of me. Don__ rush into it! Yeah. I mean, his car collection. I__ trying to catch up! But no, honestly, similar things. Like, I think it__ nice that we__e able to leave what happens on track, on the track, and be friendly off the track. I think, like Lando said, it__ very easy for it to not be that way, and that definitely takes cooperation from both parties. So, yeah, I think for me, that__ probably what I_. I mean, __dmire_ sounds a bit strong in teammates but I think that is a very good strength of Lando__. I don__ think my mom has any rituals, so to speak. Yes, she does tell me to be careful, and she normally likes it when there__ no other cars around me, which is understandable. I like that too. But apart from that, there__ nothing special. You know, obviously for my mom and, well, I mean, everyone that watches me race from Australia it__ pretty brutal at the best of times trying to stay up. So, there are a lot of sleepless nights for everyone, a lot of tough Monday mornings, regardless of what the result__ been. So, yeah, it__ always nice to have their support. Yeah, I__ relaxed. I__e been on the opposite side of the championship battle in the junior categories, and I know what that felt and it was pretty tough. So, coming into it from, you know, the least to lose out of us three is quite different for me. And I think off the back of Qatar, I__e got a lot of confidence that I can perform well. Obviously, I need a fair few things to happen this weekend to come out champion, but I__l just make sure I__ in the right place at the right time and see what happens. We__e set up a cardboard barrier between the two of us. No, it__ the same as usual. Obviously, we want to go out and make the car as quick as possible and win. We__e always wanted the same opportunities to go out and win races. So that__ exactly the same this weekend. I mean, it'd be pretty cool, to be honest. But I think it often takes a little while for those kinds of things to settle in. And at the same time, next season starts in a few weeks. So, I think regardless of whatever you've achieved in the past _ Max is probably the most qualified to say this _ but I think you move on pretty quick and try and win the next race that__ in front of you. So yeah, obviously it would be a very cool achievement. But I__ not getting my hopes up too high. We__l see what happens. And yeah, if I can achieve it, then I__l be a pretty happy guy. I did see it reach Parliament. Yeah, that__ quite impressive. Nice stat to have, given that I__ in that position. But just because history has gone that way once doesn__ mean it will again. So, I__ certainly not leaning on that, but maybe it gives me the tiniest amount of comfort that it is possible. No. I think for me, I'm trying to do it for myself. Ultimately, as racing drivers, we__e pretty selfish people most of the time. And ultimately, we__e the only ones in the car doing it for our own personal pride. Obviously, there are a lot of people along the journey _ your family, your friends, managers, whoever it might be, people that supported you. But ultimately, you start out in this sport because you want to do it for yourself. So yeah, that__ first and foremost. I__ sure Mark would love to see me win, obviously. But yeah, there' are no kind of thoughts about paying that back or anything like that.",Abu Dhabi,thursday,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. This was an incredible race for us. We made the right call there as a team to box under that Safety Car, and yeah, that was smart. And of course, super happy to win here. We stay, of course, in the fight __il the end. Yeah, I think of course it was a little bit offset because of it all, but for us I think it was a very strong race on a weekend where I think it was a little bit tough. But yeah, we still won the race and that was the most important. Yeah, I was like, __hat__ an interesting move_. I knew that then, of course, we had a bit of a gap but still you need to keep the tyres alive for 25 laps as well. The wear is very high around here, but luckily it all worked out. Well, it__ all possible now. We__l see. I don__ really worry about it too much. Exactly. Next weekend. Yeah. I mean, the start was decent. So, I got one spot, and then from there, I was, of course, just looking after the tyres a bit. But then, yeah, of course, the Safety Car came out basically at the right lap. So, we opted to box, and I guess a lot of people behind me had the same idea. So, yeah, the team did a very good job there. Stayed out of trouble also with the pit lane. You know, it was quite a busy pit lane. And from there onwards, I knew that we probably did the right thing. I think I also knew that the two McLarens needed a lot of pace to overcome basically that kind of pit stop. So I think when the Safety Car went away, of course, initially they pulled away quite a bit. But for me, it was just making sure that these two stint lengths were in the best possible pace from the first step until the end. And I think we managed that well. Just trying to do my own pace and look after the tyres, and it was enough until the flag. Well, I mean, first of all, when they called me in, I had to look and remember that it was lap__ike, we were going into lap seven. So I was like, okay, now we can go to the end. So then, yeah, I was a bit surprised once I did the whole pit stop because, I mean, when they call you in, you focus on the box and making sure you're not in trouble with releasing and whatever. So when I came out of the pit, I was like, okay, I think this is a very good opportunity now for us to win the race. I don't know. I didn__ hear anything. So maybe they were talking on the pit wall. But to me, it was very clear. I just got the call to box. I thought at that moment that there was a big chance of winning it, yeah. I don__ think about losing. That__ not in my head. I think about how to win. I mean, it was still the same as in qualifying. I'm struggling with the same things, but we won the race today by the strategy. And then, from there onwards, just trying to manage your issues in the best possible way, and I think we did that very well. I have no idea. I mean, again, I hope that we start the weekend well. Let__ say like that. That would help a lot. I think on pure pace, it will be tough, but a race like today also shows that it's not always straightforward, a Grand Prix, and a lot of things can happen. So I__ probably relying a little bit on that. I'm excited. I mean, I'm happy to go there and have a go at it. But like I said before, you need to also be realistic, that I think on pure pace, we__e not at the same level. But at the same time, when strategy maybe comes into play or making the right calls at the right time, we might have the opportunity. Yeah. I mean, honestly, it's been very strong, but that's also something that I demand of myself after basically 11 years in Formula 1. And, you know, every year, I think you become a bit more all-around. Even in the championship years, there are always things that you look back at and you're like, ""I could have learned a bit more,"" or, ""I could have done a bit more there."" And this can go from how you set up the car, what you did yourself in terms of execution in a race, or the way that you work together with the team. This year, we just had a really tough first half of the season, as everyone knows. But to still be in this fight__t the same time, I think we can be really proud of it because in the middle of the season, at some point, it was almost _ not like you lose motivation _ but you don__ really see a way forward of actually winning again in this season. It's almost like you have to hope that 2026 would be better. But we definitely made some really good steps with the car, and in some weekends, for sure, we were in a very competitive state, I would say, where we could win races. But at the same time, we__e also won races where maybe we shouldn__ have, like today, by making the right call as a team. And then, of course, it__ still up to me to execute it in the best way possible. But that__, at the end of the day, also a proper team effort. The way I work with my race engineer, with GP, and also the guys in the background__he whole team very close to me__ think we're really well integrated, and we know exactly what we need to ask of each other. That probably helps also when you're in a battle like this, when you__e not the quickest, but you still pretty much maximise everything you've got. It__ probably a bit what Carlos said as well. You try a lot of things, and a lot of things didn__ work. But then I would say since Zandvoort, we found a bit of a direction. And in some tracks, it has worked really well. Some other tracks, we still have limitations__ike here, as well. We know that in long medium-speed corners, that doesn__ suit our car, basically.
Plus, I think also the more medium-downforce tracks, that's normally probably the best for us__edium- to low-downforce, for whatever reason. So, yeah, that__ not this track, and it__ probably not really Abu Dhabi either. There are also some long corners there. But that__ something that we, of course, try to understand more also in the future. I know that the regulations are going to be completely different, but it__ still very important to figure out what you__e been doing. I don__ want to say __een doing wrong___t__ just something that you need to get better at, basically. And that__ what we are continuing to do. No. I__ a lot more relaxed now. I mean, I know that I__ 12 points down. I go in there with just positive energy. I try everything I can. But at the same time, if I don__ win it, I still know that I had an amazing season. So, it doesn__ really matter. It takes a lot of the pressure off. I__ just out there having a good time like I had today. I also started today with, __e__l see how it goes._ I know that when I sit in the car, I always try to maximise everything I can. And that__ what I__l try to do in Abu Dhabi, but at the same time, I also know that we need to rely on probably some external factors to have a go at it. But a race like today shows that when you think it's going to be boring and straightforward__t__ not. So, I__ hoping Abu Dhabi is going to be similar. He can call me Chucky. Is that short enough for you? I don__ know. I saw it as well. I thought it was quite funny. From my side, I just focus on myself. I know that when I go in the car, I just try to do the best _ like, I guess, everyone does. But, yeah, that__ the only thing I can control, right? And that__ the only thing I focus on.",Qatar,post-race,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. You know, clearly, we didn__ get it right tonight. I drove the best race that I could, as fast as I could, and yeah, there was nothing left out there. So tried my best, but it wasn__ to be tonight unfortunately. I think in hindsight it__ pretty obvious what we would have done, but I__ sure we__l discuss it as a team. Yep. Yeah, I mean it__ not all bad, obviously. It__ been a really good weekend. The pace has been very strong, but yeah, obviously a little bit tough to swallow at the moment. Pretty high _ and that__ saying quite a lot given the last few races I__e had. But, yeah, I mean, clearly, we didn__ get it right today, which is a shame because the whole weekend went very, very well. We had a lot of pace. I felt like I drove well. So, yeah, it__ pretty painful. I mean, I think on a personal level, I feel like I__e lost a win today. You know, in Vegas, I lost a P4. Obviously, for the team, it was a pretty painful weekend. But, yeah, I think for me personally, this probably hurts more. I asked, what are we doing? Because we were getting pretty close to the pit entry and I hadn__ had a call yet. So, you know, I think when you don__ get a call instantly when the Safety Car comes out, clearly there__ probably some discussions going on about what to do. And in that situation, you have to trust the team because they have a lot more information than the driver in the car on where gaps are and stuff like that. So, yeah, I mean, in that scenario I have to trust what the team decide. I think in the next few days, probably, yes, that will be quite an encouraging thing. I think this weekend is probably one of my best of the season. There are one or two others that I can think of being on the same level as this weekend. So, from that side of things, I'm very, very happy and very pleased to just be back in terms of pace. But unfortunately, it__ another weekend where something's just not gone our way. Yeah. When I got told that everyone has pitted except for me, Lando, and Ocon, and then Ocon pitted the next lap, I knew we were in some trouble. So, yeah, I think clearly some things to review. But, yeah, I don't have any answers at the moment. I don't think_ It's certainly not a catastrophe. I think we made a wrong decision today. I think that's clear, but it__ not like the world ended. So, obviously, it hurts at the moment, but with time, things will get better. There__ been lots of difficult moments__his year, previous seasons together__nd I feel like you always become stronger through some of these moments. But it all depends on how you deal with it. So I__ sure we__l get through it. But, yeah, obviously, at the moment, it does hurt. I don__ think there__ really been too many scenarios where it__ been detrimental to us, really.
Obviously, there was what happened in Monza, but that__ really the only one where maybe you can_ Well, a lot of people did argue about it! But I think the last few races have been nothing to do with how we__e approached things as a team going wrong. On my side, it__ been some things with the car and myself just not working. Clearly, Lando has been very quick the last few weeks. This weekend, I think we got it wrong just because that__ what we thought was the right thing to do _ not because we were concerned about what was fair or what was not. So I don__ think we need to change that approach. I think it yields a lot of positives. Yes, there are some tough moments, but there are also a lot of tough moments if you go in a different direction to that. So, yeah, I don__ think we need to change anything.",Qatar,post-race,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Thank you, thank you. Yeah, I__ so happy. So proud of the whole team for what we__e done today because we came into this weekend thinking it was going to be the most difficult weekend of the year and suddenly, we came out with a podium out of it. We nailed the race pace. I was super quick, much quicker than expected. We nailed the strategy. We nailed the tyre management, nailed the start, nailed all the defending and management, and that brought us an unexpected podium. So, I cannot be more proud. That__ why we got everything right today. You know, we had a tough first half of the season where things didn__ come together, but we improved in so many areas during the year. And today, there were a few opportunities out there to grab, and we grabbed all of them by executing a perfect race. And yeah, honestly, I__ over the moon with this podium because I absolutely didn__ expect it. Yeah, I don't know. I think it's obviously partly due to__r mainly due to__he hard work I think everyone's done trying to prepare this race after the very difficult weekend we had in Budapest, which is kind of, sort of, this long, medium-speed combined corners that we always seem to be very, very weak. We put together a plan with the team to try some different things in the simulator and in the factory to try and switch on the car for these kinds of track. And to be honest, right from the get-go in practice, the car was a lot better than expected, a lot more competitive.
And then we did another couple of changes going into the main quali and the main race after our learnings from the Sprint that really switched on the car, especially in the race pace. Yesterday, we struggled a lot with front deg. Today, the car felt a lot better, and we went from seeing Antonelli checking out in the Sprint and giving us ten seconds, to all of a sudden, today having a chance to keep him behind, race him, and even, obviously, with the strategy thing of the McLarens also keep Lando behind. Very different. Very, very different. I had a few ideas for the team to try and simulate, or the team came up with some other ideas and together we put together, I think, a car that honestly since the first lap was a lot better than what we thought. Already in the simulator it felt OK, but you never really trust the simulator fully. You say, no, it cannot be this good. And suddenly from the first lap of FP1, I think I was trading P1s, P2s, and P3s with these guys, and I was like, yeah, this might be working. And then we did some good progress through the weekend. Then we executed a really good race, with a good start from P7 to P5, great pit stops, great strategy, great management of the gaps, and the tyre management that we have to do with cars that are a bit quicker than us around us, you know, they__e forcing us to push on that front left tyre, which here is never easy. We managed that really well, and that brought us the P3. But it__ not possible because in order to make them, you need to know the car, and you need to try multiple things__rial and error. You need to get it wrong many weekends to know that this doesn't work, to then try the other direction that might work. And the other direction sometimes doesn't work either. And you need to try a completely different thing and you make another mistake. So, I always say the same thing: it takes time. When you switch teams, it really, really takes time _ and races. There is no testing. So, you need to try things on a race weekend and you need your first 10-15 races to understand these kinds of things__our simulator sessions to try things. And you need the team to be brave. You need also people to be bold and come up with ideas. And in the end, it always pays off. There are no secrets in this sport. I think hard work and good understanding, good conclusions always pay off. And to be honest, the second half of the year, we are performing at a very high level. It feels different. Baku was a bit of a relief because I__ had such a difficult 10 races. I was very quick in the first few races, but always things happening to me. No results coming my way. One of those seasons. I think in the career of an F1 driver, you always have years where, for some reason, things don__ come your way. Doesn__ matter if it__ luck, racing incidents, whatever. It just never comes together. But Baku was a relief__s soon as I got a chance to fight for a podium, I took it, and I gave the team the podium that I felt we needed and we deserved. And here, it's more a combination of hard work and understanding. I'm extremely proud of the team because we've also struggled a bit at the beginning of the year with race execution, team calls, quali execution. And this weekend, everyone's done a perfect job. Also, the pit stops were perfect. Everyone was perfect, and it's exactly what we all needed. I think it__ my proudest day in Williams. Happiest? Maybe Baku, because I was just so happy to get my first podium for the team. And together with that relief that I was talking about before. This is just_ I think I feel really proud of everyone. Just very proud of myself, but mainly the whole team for the weekend that we__e executed. And, yeah, more proud than happy. And obviously, also happy.",Qatar,post-race,Williams
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I mean, it's been a good weekend so far. I think everything went smoothly in the Sprint there, so yeah, happy with how it's been so far. Just need to keep it rolling. It's obviously a very different circuit to where we have been. Much higher speeds, much higher grip. I think the last couple of weekends it's just been things going wrong rather than a lack of pace, so to speak. So, I think here, everything__ going smoothly so far and the pace has been strong. So yeah, it's a track I've enjoyed in the past, so enjoying it again, clearly. Ideally, if we can find more pace. I think, you know, everyone slowly finds a little bit more through a Sprint weekend, so you__e got to try and get every bit out of the car that you can. But yeah, we__l try our best to do that. But I think our base performance seems very strong around here, so it__ more just tuning rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. Yeah, it was nice. It was nice to have some clean air again. It makes a pretty big difference. So yeah, just nice to get off to a smooth start to the weekend, really. So yeah, car's been good so far and I feel like I've been able to gel with it pretty good. So yeah, obviously, the short part of the weekend's over, and now the real stuff begins. Yeah, like five or six laps to the end. I think it was front left that was starting to vibrate a bit, and I hadn__ locked up or anything, so it__ never a great sign when you start getting vibrations out of nowhere. So I think it was a similar thing for other people as well. So yeah, we__l see if there__ any concerns with that, but that was pretty much the only concern. I mean, it__ definitely a different circuit. You know, incredibly high-speed, much higher grip surface as well. But I think, honestly, the last couple of weekends have been not bad in terms of pace. It__ just been mistakes or things out of our control going wrong. So, I think this weekend, the pace has been probably a little bit stronger, but everything__ just been smooth. So, I think that__ the biggest difference. I__l find out shortly, but the car__ been good so far. So, if it is, it__l be tweaks rather than anything major. I mean, I think whenever you__e got a vibration that sort of just comes from driving and not doing anything _ me, you know, no lockups or anything _ it__ never a great sign. I think in terms of safety, I think it__ the front tyres that are the main problem. So, I think the risk of having a catastrophic shunt from a rear puncture is probably pretty low. But yeah, whenever you__e got to put a limit in for things like this, obviously it__ a little bit of a concern, but everything was fine in the Sprint. There was a bit of a vibration. It__ not the first time we__e had a vibration from just driving, but I think it should be fine. I think they__e taken the measures. [Gives thumbs up] Yeah. I mean, I think it was very productive. I think it__ good to always give out direct feedback to the Stewards. I think [it was] tidying up a few things. I think generally things have been pretty good. Whenever you try and put any kind of guidelines or wording around going racing, there__ always going to be gaps somewhere. It__ impossible to cover everything. So, I think just some ideas and opinions on how we can close some of those gaps was good. So yeah, I thought it was productive. No, I don__ think so. I mean, I think here, normally, if you have a track limit, you__e touching the gravel or just running wide. Turn 10 entry? Ah. Maybe not then. Maybe there will be a problem! I don__ know. I think it should be fine.",Qatar,post-sprint,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean, it was a good race. Good to get P2. We obviously know these guys are really quick but those last two laps were a real struggle. This track's so quick. It's one of the most fun tracks to drive and it's obviously brutal on the tyres, on the car. So yeah, glad to bring it home. Yeah, I mean, I was trying to rest it as much as I could to be honest. It's pretty brutal. I mean, I don__ know what the G-force is _ it's like five G for what feels like forever around that triple right. But it's really cool. It's what it should be like everywhere really. And yeah, glad we got the chance to race around here. Yeah, it was a pretty lonely race, to be honest. It was fun, because it was flat out, but I didn__ really have any chance of attacking Oscar and had a pretty good gap ahead of Lando as well. So it was pretty uneventful until the last three laps _ similar to Oscar__ _ started getting a big vibration on the tyres. I could just see it opening up and I thought, __eah, this could be it,_ you know, bit of a puncture or something. So just brought it home in the last two laps. We weren__ too sure, to be honest. I think we all expected Red Bull to be the favourites this weekend based on their high-speed performance. Qualifying was strange yesterday. You know, every single lap was improving so much, and it was whoever put the lap together on the last lap of Q3 that defined the starting order. And ultimately, on a track like this with the lack of tyre degradation _ at least at the front _ where you finish lap one is where you__e going to finish the race.
So I was happy with qualifying. It doesn__ mean that this afternoon is going to be the same again because ultimately, it__ just so tight. Yeah. I mean, I felt really happy with my lap yesterday. It was one of my strongest of the season. I don__ think we__e really got the pace, to be honest. I think if we absolutely nail it, we can be there or thereabouts as we were yesterday. But I don__ think it will be as straightforward this evening. Yeah. Well, I mean, I didn__ even get DRS one single lap, so it doesn__ matter if it was three times the length or shorter. I didn__ get within DRS. Obviously, when you go around a corner almost flat out with three high-speed corners before the straight, it__ challenging to stay close. And then Turn 1, we__e braking, let__ say, around 40 metres before the corner, whereas at other tracks we__e braking at 100 or 110 metres. So yeah, as I said, it__ definitely one of the best tracks on the whole calendar to drive. Overtaking? It__ one of the toughest. Yeah. I guess when we see the tyre wear after the race, we__l get an indication. I think the vibration was probably coming from major tyre wear. And you see in those corners _ if you probably saw a slow-motion replay _ the front left is all going to be rolling over onto the outside edge of the tyre, and that__ the bit that__ going to give up first. So I think it__ required to put this limit in because, at the end of the day, if you make a tyre for a 24-race season that__ specifically designed for a track like Qatar, you__l then struggle everywhere else, if that makes sense. Or you__l have different issues everywhere else. So I don__ think we should be putting any heat on Pirelli _ they made the best tyre possible for 24 races _ but it__ just the nature of this track being so quick. They need to introduce something like that. Yeah, definitely productive. I think from the incidents that were shown, all of the drivers agreed what the penalty either should have been or lack of penalty. And yeah, like Oscar said, the general consensus in the room is: if you put these guidelines in place, they absolutely have to be guidelines. Every track is different. Every overtake is different. Every circumstance is different. Sometimes you__e got to use that racing knowledge that, as drivers, we__e all accumulated over 20, 30, 40 years of our life. And the Stewards _ the driving standards Stewards _ sometimes have to judge it based on the common sense of racing, as opposed to exactly what a guideline says. Otherwise, you may as well have a lawyer dishing out the penalties. So yeah, hopefully we can migrate more in this direction. Turn 10 entry.",Qatar,post-sprint,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"I never saw him, actually, I just saw George ahead. So yeah, I tried to go forwards. We got pretty close at the start, but it was good. No, I didn__ see what happened behind. So, long stint, it felt like a lot of pushing. So, like you said, it's going to be a tough race tomorrow. But yeah, just not easy to pass around here. Too difficult. So yeah, it's all about qualifying. Never saw him! Yeah, I mean, George was almost on pole, so he__ showing that the Mercedes is quick and he's doing a very, very good job. So, I think it__l be close. I don__ think it__ going to be an easy one. But, you know, the team have also given us a very good car once again, as they always do this year, and it__ been quick. It__ a hell of a lap around here in qualifying, so I__ looking forward to it. Pretty simple, really. You know, there__ not a lot going on. Nothing much throughout the whole race. Just impossible to follow around here, you know? As soon as you__e within three seconds or so, you start to struggle. So yeah, not a lot. I tried to save my tyres a bit for the end and the pace was certainly a little bit better. But yeah, after doing the whole race not too far behind George, then you pay the price in terms of tyre deg. So yeah, honestly, not too much. A bit of everything around here, to be honest. It__ understeer, oversteer. It__ a little bit more all over the place than in some of the last few tracks. So yeah, I mean, it__ just such a quick track. You really require every bit of downforce possible. And when you__e following so closely, you lose a lot of the downforce, so it just makes your life very, very difficult. Nothing out of the ordinary. No. I mean, the car is in a pretty good place. There__ certainly little things you might want to tweak as well, but it was more I just didn__ put things together at all yesterday, but the pace was there. So yeah, some things, some driving styles that have been working the last few weeks have just really not worked at all here, especially when it got quicker and quicker. The more I leaned on what__ been working, the more I just went slower and slower. So yeah, I tried to use the Sprint to try and learn some things. I feel like I got some things figured out and other things not. So yeah, maybe not in a perfect place, but probably a bit better than yesterday. No. Look, yeah. Of course, I saw him. But he was never too much of a threat at all. So no, my focus was more just on George and seeing how I could keep the tyres in a good place for later. But Max is very welcome to say everything he wants, to be honest. He__ kind of earned the right. You know, he__ won four World Championships. I have a lot of respect and I think that gives anyone a lot of credit. He__ achieved an incredible amount _ more than anyone generally dreams of achieving. So, you know, Max generally has a good clue about a lot of things, but there__ also a lot of things he doesn__ have much of a clue about. It__ also Red Bull__ way of going about things, this kind of aggressive nature and, yeah, just talking nonsense a lot of the time. So it depends if you want to listen to it and talk about it _ like you love to _ or you do what we do as a team, which is just kind of keep our heads down, keep focused. So maybe he would have done, but he hasn__ so far, and he keeps trying. Yeah, I mean, every corner is okay except that Turn 10 entry. So shouldn__ be an issue. But anyway, the only reference we have_ well, there is no reference. It__ a white line. And we usually judge a track limit based on a kerb or up to a gravel trap. So yeah, I think that was a bit of a surprise for a few people. Could be an easy solution just widening that white line. But yeah.",Qatar,post-sprint,McLaren
Kimi Antonelli,"I think it was, definitely, because we executed everything very well. Obviously, the strategy was pretty crazy, but we made it stick and it was good. You know, it changed the whole race and the fact that we were able to hold on to that one-stop, it allowed us to finish where we finished at the end. So definitely, it was really good execution-wise. I think also on my side, it was probably the best race of the season so far because in that stint, I was able to manage the tyres and also to put together everything I've learned during the season. It was nice because it just kept coming, and it was good fun. Well, there's many things that I've learned in the season, but I've definitely understood a lot better about my needs on the track and off track, and as well, on the mindset. I think having the right mindset before going to a session is crucial. Having the focus on the right things, on the important things, and not just focusing on the final result__ust focusing on how to get there and that means doing everything right. And then a lot of other bits, but I think I grew up a lot during the season. I became more mature, especially overcoming the difficult moments really made me grow. Now I can handle situations better. Of course, there's room for improvement, but we're on a good trajectory so far. In Baku or Qatar? It__ OK, I understand the jet lag can be_ I mean, you never know. I think last year actually Mercedes was quite strong, especially in qualifying. So hopefully we can be strong or even better. Of course, this year has been a bit of a funny trend__n the tracks where we were meant to be good, we were not so good, but in other tracks where we were __eh_, we were actually pretty good. So we'll see tomorrow. The important thing is to start on the right foot, good rhythm, and just have a nice progression during the whole weekend. But really looking forward to it, to be fair. Obviously, last two races of the season and really aiming to finish on a high. Well, definitely, no. I wouldn't have been able to do it at the start of the season. I think during the season, you learn a lot. Obviously, you go through different compounds__t__ not the same compounds every race. But to be fair, the C3 has been a compound that I quite liked as well, along with the C4 and C5. So, I think just during the season, you understand__bviously track to track it__ different__ut you understand the behaviour of the tyre. And you also try to explore a little bit, whether in practice or in the race, with different pushing levels and see how the tyre responds. Vegas was, I guess, the best execution of the season so far because I put all the learnings from previous races together. That allowed me to do a long stint and to react to the tyre getting older lap by lap. I was able _ with the support of the team _ to react and balance the car, especially in the last few laps and go until the end. But definitely, at the start of the season, I would have stopped instead of going until the end. I think, you know, the biggest surprise... well, definitely the commitments that you have during weekends, but also outside race weekends. I think this has been one of the biggest factors and one of the biggest learnings as well _ trying to manage the energy the best way possible, trying to move things around just to your own benefit. So definitely that has been the biggest challenge, I'm not going to lie. There were moments in the season where I felt pretty drained, but now obviously I know what to expect much better, and I think also next year is going to be a bit easier because going through this year and experiencing all this kind of stuff will help for next year to be also more in control of the situation. But on the other side, you get to drive these amazing cars. They're extremely quick and it's a lot of fun, especially in qualifying. The limit is so high that it__ fun to go out there and try to discover how much you can push the car. I'm not going to lie also, some tracks that were not so fun maybe in F2, with the F1 car were a lot more fun to drive. So, I think it's been very special to have the opportunity to drive such a car. Obviously next year is going to be a big difference, but we still get to drive the fastest cars in the world. I think most of them. I was very impressed with Monaco, by how quick you could go around with an F1 car _ that__ one of them. Also, Barcelona was pretty special with the F1. I mean, getting the last corner flat in qualifying is pretty incredible. You wouldn__ think to do that, and you wouldn__ want to do that in an F2 car because otherwise you end up in the grandstand _ with the spectators. In the city centre! But it__ incredible. That__ another track. And also Budapest _ I was very impressed with the F1. So all the tracks kind of become special with the F1, because it doesn__ matter how narrow they are or how short they are, with F1 you can still go really fast around, so it__ pretty special. Yeah, no, of course I__ following also. He__ a good friend of mine _ Leo. He__ been great, doing great. I mean, since last year in F3, he__ made a massive step and I__ really happy for him to see him on top of the standings so far. He__ been very consistent this year, and that__ what made the difference compared to the others. He was always there and always getting good points. So I think the goal is to try and continue this consistency and to stay at the top. Yeah, I really wish him the best because I__l be really happy for him in case he__ able to achieve this massive result. But I have no doubts. The speed has been incredible from him and consistency as well. So, yeah, really looking forward to the last rounds to see how he does. Oh yeah, for sure, many times. Since we went on the new suspension, I struggled quite a lot, especially to adapt. George, on the other hand, despite that we lost performance with the new suspension, was able to adapt _ and I struggled quite a lot more. And I just entered this negative spiral where it felt like it kept getting worse and worse, and frustration was just taking over. Yeah. I mean, that__ why today we__e having a meeting about driving guidelines, especially for next year. Definitely, we__e going to give our input based on our experiences, trying to help the FIA to set a new driver guideline standard that allows better racing. I didn__ think this year was too bad. The driver guidelines _ of course, you can use them in your way, in your favour _ but I don__ think it needs massive change. And then about the plank _ that kind of stuff _ I mean, that__ the rule. With these cars, the lower you run them, the more lap time you gain. So obviously, you need to set a limit, and if you go beyond that limit, of course you're gaining an advantage, and that__ why you get a penalty. I remember Mercedes in Austin 2023 _ they had the same issue with the plank and got disqualified. Of course, sometimes you have external circumstances, like McLaren might have said they had more porpoising than expected. That__ unlucky, of course, but the rule is the rule. It is what it is. I think next year we__e not going to have as much of an issue with the new regulation. Yeah. I think strategy is going to be much more straightforward for everyone with the 25-lap limit. Also, tyre pressure has increased so that might impact the balance a little bit and how the tyre behaves. But you don__ want to end up with a puncture or a tyre failing during the race because it__ very painful to do a lap on three wheels. I mean, some people have done_ Lewis even won a race on three wheels, but you just don__ want that to happen because it might screw your race. So, I can understand the concern _ it__ better to be safe than sorry. Obviously, it__ going to change the race and how the tyre allocation works, but other than that, I think the strategy will be more straightforward. So probably it__ going to be a more flat-out race, which is not a bad thing. Well, for sure. Definitely, being in a top team straight away means you're under the spotlight a lot more and every little action or mistake you do is a lot more seen. Especially in the difficult period, it__ been tough. But together with the team _ the team has never stopped supporting me. Eventually, we were able to overcome the difficult moment and start building momentum.",Qatar,thursday,Mercedes
Oliver Bearman,"Drive a bit quicker. It's given us the feeling that we've been chasing all year. Basically, it makes the car a bit more on edge on occasion, with specific wind conditions and traffic, for example, it can be a bit more challenging with this upgrade, but I think that's always the trade-off that you're playing with, especially this late into a cycle of regs. I think it's given us a few tenths__robably not even a few__ven a tenth, tenth and a half. But with the way that F1 is at the moment, that's enough to put you up the order. Of course, it was a risk taking that upgrade this late into the season with the new regs next year, but I think based on our position__nd every Constructors' position is incredibly valuable to a team like Haas__ think we've made the right call. I hope so. I mean, the team had a good race here last year, and with our car characteristics... I mean, when I was looking at the last five or six events, Vegas was the one that I was least looking forward to, and to come away from there with two cars in the points really tells me that we can fight on any track. So, it's less down to car performance and more down to execution and getting that right. We know that quali is incredibly tight, so it__ just about putting the car in the perfect window and executing. I think using my speed and taking the right, measured risk in the correct moments is something that I've improved on. Because, you know, coming from F2 where in free practice you put the car already on the limit in lap two or lap three because you have one set of tyres and the tyres are degrading a lot. So you need to find out what the car is capable of before you get into quali. But then, generally on an F1 weekend, you have so many sets of tyres and so many sessions that you have time to build up. That approach is something I haven't really taken since Formula 4, because when you're in F3 and F2, you have no time on track and no tyres. So, kind of resetting my driving, my approach, back to building up step-by-step and slowly finding out the limitations of the car__ecause at the end, Friday _ not this weekend, but a general Friday with FP1 and FP2 _ doesn't really matter that much. The main thing is that you correct the balance and get the car in the perfect window. Then on Saturday is when you start to go for it and push a bit more. So that and also structuring my weekends a bit better. It__ so much busier here in Formula 1 compared to what we've been used to. So, you know, managing even the energy levels across the full season. There__ a lot of things, but I__ also glad that it__ been going well the second half, and I want to finish now on a high. Biggest surprise or biggest difference, I would say, is probably how busy you are compared to F2. We do almost double the races in Formula 1, but also away from the track__ lot more activations with partners, a lot more media commitments. So, for example, next year we start already in week two or three, so there__ not really breaks like we had and were used to in Formula 2. So, your energy level__t__ one thing driving the car, but the other thing is arriving at the track always 100% ready to go. And the biggest benefit is that the car is really fun to drive. I really enjoy putting the F1 car at the limit, especially in qualifying. It's always a pleasure. And probably the travel's a bit easier now__e get to fly in business class and that__ a bit more comfortable. In the city centre. Luckily, we have a meeting with the FIA. I think our main concern as drivers is, first of all, that we don__ have permanent stewards, which is quite challenging because the guidelines are guidelines, and they__e interpreted differently by different stewards. For the level of our sport, if we compare ourselves to other elite sports, we__e one of the only ones with a judging panel that changes race to race, which is challenging for us. And I think just trying to give them a bit of perspective of what it__ like to be in the car. There are some penalties given out this year where, if you ask the drivers, the majority _ or all of them _ would agree that it should or shouldn__ be a penalty, and sometimes the result from the stewards is different. That__ why we want to create a bit of parity. So, yeah, I think it__l be a long night tonight with the meeting. Okay. Yeah. Best _ Brazil. Worst _ Australia. Pretty easy. Brazil, I think. Well, you know, I__ in F1 and you have to back yourself. So yes, I believe I__ ready, but I have to continue to prove that. It__ not that I had five or six good races that suddenly everything changes.",Qatar,thursday,Haas
Liam Lawson,"Yeah. I think with how many races we have, you just don't have time to really dwell. I think it's important that you obviously reflect on each weekend and try to take the positives and try to learn from each weekend. But, yeah, to go through this many weekends and trying not to get stuck on something or caught up in emotion is very tough. So, as an example, last weekend - to have a very smooth weekend all the way up to the race and be in a great position, and then a very small mistake throws that all away__t__ extremely frustrating. But obviously, we're racing again this weekend, and you just don't have time to dwell on it too much. I would say it's definitely been more of a struggle for me. I think the car has been very quick, and I think that's been what we've really worked on on our side a lot more this year__rying to extract one lap out of the car, and out of me. And I think it's got a lot better through the year. Obviously, Vegas was very specific. It was more like 12 laps than one lap with the way quali was. But I think it's been getting better through the year. And with how close it is, it__ just putting everything together. I mean, in a whole weekend, trying to execute everything is hard enough. That's been really the challenge in a season that__ this close. And it's also why when things don't go smoothly, you can lose quite a lot. It's kind of like what Kimi said. We've had a lot of races we expected to either be quick at not be quicker and either/or. We had a tough race last year _ for us Qatar last year was one of the hardest. So I'm hoping that means, for whatever reason, we're good this year. But it's very hard to know. It__ a very different track to Vegas, but I think we're in a much better place now with the car than we've been last year. We have a better understanding. But obviously, being a sprint, it's going to be a challenge for sure. But hopefully we can have a good weekend. Not much more to add, honestly. I think it__ just trying to create a way that, when these decisions are made, it__ taken into account what it__ actually like being behind the wheel and driving these cars. The current guidelines were made to try and understand what we were trying to say last year, but they__e ever-evolving. We__l try to make things even more clear this evening and try to create a better system for next year. Mexico? Really? Best, actually, maybe Brazil as well or Baku. And then Australia.",Qatar,thursday,RB
Nico H_lkenberg,"You tell me. Whenever you want! When do you want it to be? I think celebrating on a race weekend is tough. Maybe Sunday night__opefully Sunday night next weekend. But looks like it's next weekend. It's just, you know, a few races I did but didn__ start the race. So, it's three or four. Yes and no. I think it's something, you know, as a driver, you don't really think about so much. You just race, you live in the present, you do your best, you keep grinding, you keep showing up. And, you know, it was good fun. I would do it all over again. Obviously good days and bad days, but all in all, a great industry to be in. Worked with a lot of great people, made friends, and still enjoying myself. This one, of course. Yeah, it's been also, you know, with ups and downs obviously, as is usual for every kind of midfield team__ou have those swings. We started on the back foot, not in the best position, then recovered from Barcelona onwards, turned things around, got a grip on the season. Obviously put in a few nice highlights, few big results for us. All in all, I think good progress. You feel like something is growing and cooking in the background. As a team, I think we've really connected and improved on many areas, many things. Obviously always more to improve, more to work on, but it's been enjoyable and I look forward to the next 12 months. The vibe__ good. Obviously, when you have results, when you're racing for points, you're battling, it's a different feeling. Everyone is happy and engaged, and it brings a certain vibe and environment. I think you shouldn't forget where the team came from last year, which was obviously a very difficult season for them. And we kind of worked our way out of that a little bit, dug ourselves out, it rewarded us with many strong races this year and with a car that's competitive in the midfield for most of the season. So, yeah, we've come a long way and need to keep doing what we're doing. (no response) Absolutely. I mean, being a rookie doesn__ mean you can__ perform or you don__ know how to drive. I mean, we all were rookies at one point. You__e got to start at one point in F1. And for sure, Gabi__ been very impressive on the driving side__riving inputs, driving techniques as well__t__ something that he's really strong at. So to be honest, there have been many points this year where I learned from him. We bounce off each other, looking at each other__ data. Just, yeah, absolutely, yes. Gut feelings are not worth that much. Hopefully a bit stronger than what we are now, but we__l see. I think a bit more neutral for me. I don__ mind it. I think just the following, particularly this year, has really become very, very bad. But otherwise__ mean, bit heavy, yes__ut in quali, they__e pretty quick. So, I don__ mind it. Not really, because, you know, I__ not really the dreamer type. It would be different, but, you know, it didn__ happen. I had a few close misses, but at the end of the day, they don__ matter. They don__ count. I am where I am and what happened, happened. Well, not close enough, obviously. Well, it__ important for all of them__ith Aston and with Haas. We__e in that fight. Two to go, obviously sprint here. Everyone wants to do as well as they can. Same rules apply. Obviously, we__l all do our best and see who comes out where.",Qatar,thursday,Sauber
Carlos Sainz,"Why is there a doubt? No, not really. I think starting from P3 from a crazy qualifying, the moment you know the race is going to be dry, the normal thing is to go backwards__specially if the top cars are starting next to you, which was the case. I think in Baku I was starting P2, but the McLarens, the Mercedes and the Ferraris were not even in Q3, or they were towards the back end of Q3. Some crashed, some had their issues, and in Baku I could hold on to the podium. But in Vegas, they were starting too close to me. They had two to four tenths pace advantage, and over 50 laps that__ a lot of seconds of race time that they__e going to catch at some point. So, no, I was quite happy with the race. I think the second midfield car was quite far behind, so I think we did everything we could to get the maximum points for the team that race. Well, it__ just at the speed range where every track we go to, we__e the slowest on those sorts of corners. It__ 150 to 200 km/h, medium-speed, high-speed corners__ourth, fifth, sixth gear. Every track we go to, we see the GPS data, and we tend to be one of the slowest cars or one of the slowest teams. And in Qatar, you only have those corners. So, unless we come up with something magical in terms of setup that switches the car on for this kind of corners__hich we cannot switch on in other tracks____ afraid it__ going to be the most or one of the most difficult weekends of the season. Having said that, I think it__ a great opportunity for the team and for myself to learn why we are weak in this kind of corners, why our car doesn__ like this kind of corners, and still try to execute a good weekend in a difficult track. It__ a difficult question. I think expectations are always high but going into this year I tried to get them in check, knowing it was going to be a difficult year for me__oming obviously from a top team, getting back into the midfield and not knowing exactly what kind of car Williams was going to deliver for this year. But honestly speaking, I think if you would have told me when I signed my Williams contract back in the summer of 2024 that this year there would be a podium, fifth in the Constructors___hich we__e trying to seal soon__nly a couple of tenths off the top teams in a lot of tracks, another podium in a Sprint, plenty of points for both Alex and me_ I think I would have signed even quicker. So, I think it__ a good first year__ot perfect because we__e gone through, like every midfield team, a lot of ups and downs. I__e had to readapt myself back to racing a bit more in the midfield. And for sure, it hasn__ been a perfect year, but we__e had a lot of good highlights and good moments, better moments than I would have probably even dreamed or wished for. I__l go_. GPDA! I think first, we need to sit together, analyse quite a few of the incidents. I think there's been quite a lot of division in opinion between drivers, FIA, Stewards__ust different ways to judge different incidents. This year, there's been quite a bit of confusion regarding a few of them. We need to sit together and go through them and analyse them calmly, out of the heat of the moment, like we are now on a Thursday before a race and try to hopefully come up with a better solution for the future. My personal opinion _ and here I__ not talking from a GPDA perspective, just as Carlos Sainz _ is that there's potential to do better and that the guidelines themselves have created more problems than solutions in a lot of issues that have happened this year in the way we judge incidents. There's been barely any room for racing incidents this year. It__ always been either white or black because we've been supported by the guidelines, and the guidelines haven't allowed racing incidents to be judged as racing incidents because there was always a tyre in front or behind a mirror or a front or rear tyre__hatever the guidelines say, I don't know them by heart. It__ been, in that sense, not a successful implementation of those guidelines. But that__ what we need to discuss that__ why we need to sit together and see if there__ any other solution. I think it__ a temporary thing, this 25-lap limit here only for Qatar. I don__ think it would work in the future to put a forced two-stop limit. I__e seen some comments saying that. I think the races are the best when you have a variety of strategy and it__ between a one and a two, or between a two and a three. But it__ never good when it__ a forced two-stop like we saw in Monaco or here a few years ago, when it was almost like a three-stopper or a four-stopper mandated. Because if in the end, everyone has the same deg, same tyres, it__ not like you can do much with flexibility. And I think the future solution of F1 is having more of a variety of strategies that can work, rather than a mandated number of stops. But I think for here it__ just purely reliability, and we will see. No one knows. I have a good feeling. But no one knows. Again, I__ going to speak as Carlos Sainz, not as GPDA here. I__ going to give you as honest an answer as possible. I think recently after races I__e seen some analysis done of quite a lot of the incidents. Some of them by Karun Chandhok, some of them by Jolyon Palmer, some of them by Anthony Davidson. And every time I see this analysis that they do and the verdict that they give__rom racing drivers that have been recently racing__ think they do a very good analysis and they put the blame correctly most of the time on who actually has the blame or if it__ actually just a racing incident. My future ideal is no guidelines and people that are able to judge these sorts of incidents as well as these three people do after the races. Again, this is just my opinion, but I__ quite impressed at the job some of the broadcasters do after a race with this in-depth analysis of each of the incidents and how they apply blame or no blame into certain scenarios. I think that__ a level of analysis and a level of __tewardness_, if you want to call it that way, that I think is very high level. Probably doesn__ mean we__l agree 100% on the cases that these three ex-drivers give, but I think a lot of times, they are very close_90%, let__ say, correct. And if I had to go and see Formula 1 in the future on the stewarding level, this is more or less the level that I would appreciate. This is where I get lost. Like, I don__ know if we need guidelines or not. I just say that when I see these people taking the time to analyse this sort of incident as a driver__hen I see how they do it, the language they speak, how they explain it, and obviously the background they have to make this analysis__ really feel like they understood what happened in that incident, and the judgement they take. This doesn__ mean that the stewards don__ do a good job. It just means that what I see after the race from these people is actually a very high level that I think, without guidelines, they would be able to judge each decision correctly. And there wouldn__ be a bias or anything like that. Same. I had a struggle with them in 2022 adapting to this generation, and I__e had a bit more success later on adapting to it, but it__ not in my nature to drive these cars the way I have to drive them. I actually had to relearn a couple of different skills that I didn__ know I would need to drive a Formula 1 car. And I__ glad it__ over, and hopefully next year I can go back to a more natural driving style. Well, I think I need to be very careful with this. I do think there__ older generation people that do a very good job with the stewarding. I don__ want to name any names. I don__ want to be personal with anyone. But I do think there__ people out there doing a very decent job. The only thing I say__nd I insist that I don__ want to get into too much analysis here__s that when I hear these people, these young ex-racing drivers doing analysis, they speak a lot of sense. When I read and I say, __f we could have two or three of these judging our racing incidents or our penalties,_ I think most of the time these people wouldn__ need guidelines. They would be very honest and very accurate in taking some of the conclusions that we would need them to take. So, I put it out there as an idea. Obviously, nowadays, to come to 24 races, probably you also need a fixed salary. You need the job to be relatively important because it takes a lot of time out of your life. So, we need to look at how to organize that. But again, I don__ want to get into too much analysis here. I just want to say that when I take time to see those back__aybe two days after I go home and it comes up in social media, these people making the analysis____ like, I see it exactly the same way. And I think most of the drivers see it in a very similar way. So, it__ an idea.",Qatar,thursday,Williams
Lewis Hamilton,"I don__. Just look forwards. There__ not really much to say. The results have shown. There are some positives to take from it, and you just move forwards. Gelled with the team and there__ amazing passion within the team. And just going to focus on next year. Probably just rebounding. Just getting back up. I think probably I__ be surprised if the other drivers are excited about next year at the end of a season, because usually you don__ have a lot of energy at the end of a season. You__e looking forward to time with family and stuff. That__ really it. But, I mean, look__hat was just in the heat of frustration. Often, there__ a lot of frustration at the end of the races, particularly when they haven__ gone well. So, no, I__ excited to see what the team build next year and to continue to build on with them. No. I don__ know. I think the car should be pretty decent in the areas that Carlos was mentioning, in terms of speed profile. I think our car should be pretty good in those areas. Might be hard to keep up with the Red Bull, but I__ hoping for a better weekend. He answered it well. Kimi? I mean, I haven__ worked with Kimi, but I__ enjoying watching him grow as a man and as a driver. I think he__ done an amazing job this year. Particularly in the second half of the season, he__ really stepped it up. So, I__ really happy to see that, and we have a great relationship. I don__ have a gut feeling. I don__ know. No one knows. Well, firstly, that__ a hypothetical question, so I wouldn__ really go into that. But I would, absolutely. I don__ regret the decision I made joining the team. I know it takes time to build and grow within an organisation, and I expected that. So, yes. Yeah, I think we__e all excited to see the back end of these ones for sure. Yeah. The passion is the most special thing about the brand and the people that work for it. And then the Tifosi__s we travel around the world, the amazing support that we get. I think that probably makes it even harder when we have the more difficult weekends because you can see how passionate, how dedicated, and how hard every single person is working back at the factory, and the results are not reflecting or rewarding them. So, you feel it more. It__ a big emotional bubble that__ quite precious. I definitely think there's_ We have a lot of work to do, for sure, over winter. We'll analyse the season. There are lots of improvements we need to make collectively, but I think no one's under any illusion in the team that we all have to play our part. And I believe that we can. So, yeah, I__ hoping we implement and make those changes, along with hopefully a better package next year. I__ not concerned about it. No. Of course, I__e just been focusing on my side during this period. Obviously, Charles has done a great job. He__ been there for seven years. He__ got a team around him that he__ worked with for many years. So, it__ a well-oiled machine. On my side, it__ a new group of people. For me, it__ a new environment that I__ still getting used to working with. Then I had another new member halfway through the year. So, we__e all working as hard as we can, but getting that to work as well as someone that__ had it for several years is not__ou don__ just do it like that. It takes a bit of time.",Qatar,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was good. I mean, of course like in practice, not really knowing what the tyres were going to do. Even in the race, I think you could see everyone just trying to find a rhythm, seeing how much you could push, especially in the first stint because you're on the more fragile tyre. And yeah, it worked really well. I mean, normally the race is always a tough one for us. We are normally not that great on tyres. But today it seemed like we had that a bit more under control and I could push a little bit more. And that just unlocked a bit more pace. I could stay out a bit longer and split, basically, the race in half. And yeah, that definitely helped a lot. The car was working pretty well, much more to my liking. And yeah, then it was, at the end, quite a decent gap. But yeah, it was just every lap feeling comfortable and not taking too much out of the tyre. I mean, I__ either stay at 69 or I have to go to 169, because it's actually quite a cool number. Yeah, I think that's the better approach. I mean, it's still a big gap. But, you know, we always try to just maximise everything that we've got. And this weekend, that was first. And yeah, the upcoming weekends we'll again try to win the race. And at the end of Abu Dhabi, we'll see where we end up. But I'm very proud of everyone. You know, we've had a really up and down season and tough times, but also really beautiful moments. And we learned a lot throughout the whole season, and that's also very valuable for the upcoming years. So that's something that we just have to cling on to and [we__l] just try to improve even more to come back stronger for next year, to put up a fight from the start of the year in the championship. But we're enjoying it now, and then we'll see next week what we can do again. Yeah. Well, I mean, it helped, of course, to get into the lead in Turn 1. I do think in the first stint, we were all finding our feet a bit with how much to push or not, how much we had to manage, because I do think we were all quite close up until the pit stops. So we were just trying to get a good balance, because we didn't really get to have a good understanding on Thursday. But yeah, it felt better than expected, I would say, already on that compound. And then, when we got onto the hard compound, I think already because we did quite a decent first stint, it made the second stint a little bit easier. But even there, you have to also make sure that you don't overcook it with the tyre. But yeah, we did well. Good communication with the pit wall as well. So yeah, actually very enjoyable, very nice, relaxed. So it was great. Yeah. I mean, that's what you should do to cover off the inside. But I think it's very easy to get caught out with where you have to brake also, because normally in the start, you leave the grid and then you look in the mirror. But here, it's almost like you don't have a lot of time to look in the mirror because you immediately have to brake again. And it's quite slippery anyway. So yeah, I guess that's what happened. Well, we have been more consistent on the podium, let's say like that. Some races we've not been in contention for the win, but from, I would say, the middle of '24 until the middle of '25, we were more probably off the podium than on. And now, at least, we are always fighting for a second or a third place, but at least on the podium, and that's already, for us, I think a very good step forward. I think that should have been the case from the start, of course, if you want to really fight for a title. But yeah, unfortunately, we didn't get it right in the beginning, but at least now it's more consistent and sometimes, yeah, it's good enough then to win. Yeah. Just trying to enjoy, have a good time, and when you can win, you try to win. It's because they don't come as easy as '23. So in '23, it was more like ticking boxes. Now it's not like that, and we come from a very tough period, already last year. This year, it's been annoying at some stages as well. Everyone, of course, was not happy with the performances. And then, yeah, to still have this kind of end to the season for us is amazing. So you need to enjoy that because it's a big motivational boost for everyone. And that's why__t works the same for me. My three best races with Honda... I think our first podium together__hat was a very big milestone. Everyone was, I think, very emotional. First World Title, because that is always very special, and also for Honda after the initial struggles with the engine, to then basically deliver such a powerful engine, and so strong and reliable__ think that was very impressive. And honestly, it__ just been fantastic working with them. I really, really like everyone. They have their own way and own mentality of how they operate, and I really like it. And they've always been super respectful. So I will always remember the years that we have been working together. Yeah, I mean, to pick the third one is probably very hard, because we've had so many great wins together. So I just picked the ones that probably were more emotional and that was definitely those two. Yeah. Well, I mean, you have to, at the end of the day, also make up your own mind, right? Some people like more show added. Some people like different kinds of tracks as a fan also. And I also have my opinions about what I like. Some weekends I like more than others. I still like to be in Vegas, but I'm personally less of a showman. I'm not really into that probably. But I get it, you know, it's part of the calendar. If you're in Vegas, it needs to be like this. So I get it, and that's fine, you know. I'm considering a lot of options at the moment. No. I'll let you know when I make my decision.",Las Vegas,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"No, he didn't go for it. I went for it and no one else. Yeah. Actually, I let Max win. I let him go. Let him have a nice race! No, I just braked too late. It was my f-up. I don__ know__ wanted to put on a show, right? So that's why we're in Vegas, I guess. No, it was not my best performance out there. But when the guy wins by 20 seconds, it's because he's just done a better job and they're a bit quicker. So, fun race out there. Difficult as always, but we were fine. I said I ***** it up. Yeah. You know, I__e honestly had a good run. I think the pace was still good today. Max just drove a good race and he was quick. I made the mistake into Turn 1. You know, you__e  got to be punchy into Turn 1. I was just a bit too punchy, and that cost me. So that__ the way it is sometimes. Still a good result__econd__nd still good points. You know? So it's not like I'm too disappointed. I__e got to congratulate Max and Red Bull. They drove a good race. So onto the next one. I think there was just some issues with the car, the team were telling me on the radio. So, yeah. Just had to back off a bit. Not really. We just weren't quick enough today. We didn't have the pace. I messed up Turn 1__t was pretty poor from me. I just braked too late. So yeah, it was all on me, pretty poor from myself. But even if I came out in P1 out of Turn 1, we were not quick enough today. Same as Brazil. Max has done a very good job and the Red Bull is very quick. They deserve the win today. They were in another league compared to us. So a bit of a shame that we didn't have more pace, but we__e got to try and improve a bit more. Yeah. Of course. I think we still know that there are certain corners here and certain characteristics that are really not good for us. But we still finished second. It's not like it's the end of the world. We just have high standards and we want to win. We want to come away from here with a gold trophy, not a silver or bronze one. So, I guess we're disappointed it wasn't better, and we're disappointed we didn't come away with another win like we've had the last few weekends. But it just wasn't possible today. I think we still look at it in terms of: are we doing a good enough job as a team? And today we didn__. The car just wasn't performing well. We had a lot of issues, and Max has done a good job and Red Bull have done a good job. So, you know, we're just comparing ourselves to the level that we need to be at if we want to win races. We come to every race to try and win. So when we don't win, we're not very happy. Still two more weekends. So, two more opportunities to try and make up for it. No. I'm just pretty disappointed with today. So, no. I look forward to Qatar. I look forward to getting somewhere warm and, yeah, just go play some golf, go play some padel for a few days, enjoy a few days off, and do everything we can to try and win in Qatar. I'm pretty thankful George was also having issues. Otherwise, today would have been even worse. So I'm not sure how close it was. I don't know if the sensor was saying things it shouldn't have been or what, or we just used more than expected or what it was. I don't know the full extent. I need to go and see the team and understand more, to be honest. So it was more I was just annoyingly listening to what they were telling me to do, which was losing a lot of pace, and, yeah, certainly didn't help in the chance to try and attack Max a bit more. I was all out. We just weren't quick enough. They were just much quicker than us today. Not miles, but we certainly had our issues, and that made the gap probably bigger than it was. But otherwise they were just quicker. Even if I came out of Turn 1 ahead, I don't think we would have won the race today. So I still take P2 as a good result. I'm pretty happy because of it. But I'm not happy because it's P2. Like Max says, it's tough, it's close, and I gave myself a good opportunity yesterday to try and win the race. Of course, I messed it up and made my life tougher into Turn 1. But even after that, we just weren't quick enough. Even when I thought I kept the tyres in a better condition than the others, kind of brought them in nicer, I was pushing flat out, and Max was still pulling away. So it seems like lately we've been able to improve our quali pace, but our race pace has taken a bit of a hit. Even when you look at Brazil__ur quali pace was very strong, but Max was still a little faster in the race. Similar this weekend__e were very, very good yesterday, like incredibly strong yesterday, but just not good enough today. So we'll see what's maybe changed over the last few weeks and what we can improve on for Qatar. I don't know. I guess I've never been in that position before, so I probably can't really answer it. But nothing feels different now, even though that is the opportunity I'm entering into. And even when I felt like I had a bad day today, it was still relatively a good day, you know? So, no, I treat it the same. I treat it like I want to go and win. I'll do everything I can to try and win the race. It's certainly a lot more fun when you win than when you come second place. So yeah, my goal is to win both races to the end of the season, and the Sprint as well. So I'll try and win all three, I guess. But no, I don't know if anything changes. Nothing for the minute. I just focus on having a few days off and obviously shifting the time zone all the way back to wherever we have to get back to and then focusing on FP1. Yeah. I think it's certainly better than it was a few years ago. I think that was a bit too much for everyone. Might as well have been in Cirque du Soleil with what we were doing back then. So I think we're all much happier with what we're doing now. But it__ a nice event. I think it would be better if it was a little bit warmer or something, I think we would all appreciate if it was a bit more... I don't know if it__ a few months earlier or later, whatever it__ going to be, but yeah, if it was a bit warmer, I think everyone would enjoy it as a weekend a bit more. I think even the fans__t__ not pleasant for the fans sitting out there in the cold the whole day and in the rain. So if it could move around, I'm sure some things would please everyone.",Las Vegas,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"It was there throughout, but it was the tyres. When Max came out the pits, I thought I had a chance here with the cold tyres and I really, really pushed hard and I just damaged the tyres. From there on in, I was on the radio saying I'm not sure this tyre is going to make it to the end. And it was really difficult. So again, it wasn't a great race outside, but standing here on the podium is, yeah, probably the maximum we could have achieved. Well, I had the same steering issue as I had yesterday after about five laps. But after probably four laps after the issue, I was managing to drive around it. The pace was not bad in the first stint. Obviously made a good start. Probably only a tenth or so slower than Max in that first stint. Then after the pit stop, I saw that opportunity to attack and just pushed really hard for two laps, and I destroyed my tyres. I knew with about 16 laps to go__r probably 20__t was going to be very challenging to get to the end. So it wasn__ very enjoyable, to be honest, because I just couldn't get around left-hand corners. I don't know, to be honest. You can always have that debate. But honestly, if I was sat in Lando's position now, it doesn't change anything for me. I want to fight for victories. I saw that half an opportunity. I thought Max was going to struggle a bit more on his out lap, and I had to go for it. And if I nursed my tyres in those laps, I'd be sitting here still in P3, maybe wondering if only I could have attacked when I had the opportunity. So no regrets. It just wasn't an enjoyable race. I think we have a car this year that's just more consistent over 24 races. I think our car last year was either exceptionally strong or exceptionally weak. And that__ really why we had more highlight moments last year as a team. But over 24 races, we scored substantially less points. So, of course, you want to win races, but the goal ultimately is to score as many points as possible in a season. And we have a car this year that has given us a substantially better opportunity to achieve that than we had 12 months ago. Yeah. I think overall the weekend's very enjoyable, and they've done a great job. It's been evolving over these three years. Of course, it is a massive challenge__he time zone, not just for us, but for the thousands of people who travel to every single race. So I guess it'd probably be nicer if this was a standalone race rather than back-to-back. But either way, at this time__nd if you're going to do a night race in Vegas__hichever way you do it, it's going to be very challenging.",Las Vegas,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Boy, it was stressful. Stressful as hell. I mean, I didn't know no one else was going to get a lap after me, so I knew I felt like the first few sectors were good. It's so slippery out there. As soon as you hit the kerb a little bit wrong like I did, you snap one way, you lose the car the other way, close to hitting the wall. But good enough. Good enough for P1 today. So, yeah, not the nicest of conditions, but I'm happy it stopped raining and we could get a good qualifying on. I mean, you need a good car to do it, first of all. So, the team did a good job. To be honest, I was having a little nap before quali, and I was expecting it to be dry. And I woke up and I saw it was raining, and I thought, __h crap, this is not going to go well_. But, yeah, it's just _ no one's driven around here in the rain before. It's difficult to know what to expect. And after Q1, it was pretty _ like every corner, you felt like you could crash and it could easily be over. So, one step at a time. Q1, Q2, Q3 _ all tough. So, more rewarding a day like this because it was a tricky one? Shoot from the hip. Yeah. I've never said that before in my life, but _ I mean, the pace has been good all weekend. I think it was going to be good in the dry. I honestly didn't expect to be as good as I was then in the wet. So very happy with that. But there are a lot of unknowns tomorrow. No one's really done much high-fuel running. No one's really done more than, like, 10-lap stints. So I'm sure it's going to be an interesting race _ especially, you know, with Max up there, with Carlos as well. Nice to see him up in the top three. So hopefully we can have a good race tomorrow, and everyone can enjoy it. Pretty nasty. Probably some of the worst__ot like the worst conditions, you know, it's been wetter. It's just, it feels like you may as well have been out on slicks, to be honest. It was so slippery, difficult. The amount of wheelspin you have in places, how easy it was to lock tyres, the white lines, the yellow lines__ust everything was pretty tough. So, yeah, even more satisfied with the end result because of how tricky it was out there today. But some good laps just to keep it controlled, keep it in a good manner through Q1, through Q2, and obviously risk a little bit more into Q3, and it paid off. So, very happy. In 1, 2, 3_ I mean, the braking zones are all quite tricky. Obviously, it's a long lap, and then you get to quite a very difficult last corner__urn 14__ig stop, easy to lock the front tyre. It's easy to just want to brake five metres later, ten metres later. And then you've got the kerbs. A lot of people crashed there and made mistakes, spun. I was close to doing it on my final lap. There were just even bits around the track that were quite weird__ome bits felt actually OK, some bits felt just shockingly slippery and difficult to manage, to control the car, the wheelspin__verything. So just, yeah, random bits. But the big braking zone, especially the final corner on a quali lap, is the most daunting, I would say. It was tricky, especially because there's always a risk of yellow flags and also red flags here. I'm surprised there wasn't more, in a way, because of the difficulty today. But we weren__ out near the front, so I was pretty happy to wait a little bit longer down the end of the pit lane and just have some cleaner air, stay out of the way of everyone else behind, try and avoid as much as possible the yellow flags and take that risk element out of it and just let me put some laps in, build the confidence in the car. Of course, I was, I think, the only one who got one more lap at the end of the run, and that worked out perfectly. I think we were still pretty good before, and then to get the timing of__ think we did like push-push, push-cool-push or something at the end. So, yeah, just making sure the battery was ready, making sure the tyres were in good condition. And obviously, having that chance to go one more lap than everyone else worked out perfectly. Never easy on a day like today, but everything worked well. Just everywhere in Las Vegas. Every corner, every straight, every bump. I proved myself wrong in terms of, you know, the expectation was pretty low coming into this weekend, even on Wednesday in the press conference. I wasn't expecting too much. But they were definitely not high. So for us to show some good performance yesterday, this morning as well in practice before some of the issues we had__ already felt pretty good and quite confident that if it was going to be a dry quali, we would be challenging. It would be tight, but we could be challenging for pole. So when I woke up from my nap before quali, I wasn__ too happy seeing it was raining, because it's always just a bit more chaos. And, yeah, never the most confident over the course of this year__specially the beginning__ith these conditions, with the car. It can be quite tricky at times. But from the first lap I actually felt pretty good in the car, and that turned into a good result. Yeah, quite a bit. I don't think I've done more than four laps in a row. So I've got no idea on stints and things like that. Many questions, probably for everyone. I'm sure not many people have run the Hard tyre, that kind of thing. I don't really know. The pace has been strong__as been better than it was last year, that's for sure. So I expect to be fighting up there, but with Max, with Carlos__ou know, they could both be pushing as good opportunities for them. So yeah, it's going to be a long race. Many things can happen. Obviously, if it's dry, a bit more simple for everyone, I think. But I'm in the best position I can be, so happy for now. Yeah, not enough lights around here, to be honest. It wasn__ the most wet session. Some little bits of aquaplaning and stuff, but the hardest part was just trying to avoid white lines, the yellow lines, staying off the paint_ the stuff they can't really remove. I wish they could because it's quite a bit more dangerous and tricky, especially when it__ like Q1. It was wet enough that you can__ really see where the lines are__oad markings, zebra crossings, whatever__o you don't know where you're braking. It's easy to instantly lock if you brake on the lines, and pretty dangerous from that point of view. It's one of the challenges of street tracks. It's the same in Australia at the beginning of the year. That__ certainly one of the biggest challenges _ the kerbs, the lack of room for error around here is pretty tricky. The amount of people that made mistakes in 15-16, end of the lap over the kerbs, losing the rear. Then you__e got this massive yellow line you have to try and avoid. My thoughts were generally just keeping it in one piece for as long as possible. Even the last corner here__airly easy flat in the dry__ot so easy in the wet, and we had quite a bit of porpoising still. So it was difficult to get the confidence to go flat. For most of qualifying, my biggest loss was just the last kink to end the lap and to start the following lap. So, yeah, difficult. Especially because of the position I__ in__nowing that I just need a good qualifying, a simple one. When I woke up from my nap, I was like, __h God, not what I was looking forward to_. But nice to prove to myself that I could perform well in those conditions and do what I needed to do. The good feeling that I__e had from the past few weekends has continued__ven into the rain__nd that__ one of the most reassuring things I__e had for a while. Yeah, I think Carlos explained it pretty well. I think the tricky thing is always just when you__e on a quali lap, you always want to brake five metres later. And normally when you try to brake five metres later is when it can easily go wrong, you know? Yeah, the trickiest part is easily Q1. Just because you're just trying to keep it on the track. Not crash. Not take yourself out. One day, I just hope__part from having a two-seater F1 car__eople can get that sensation of just how nerve-wracking and scary it can be at times. How unpredictable. You know, like we said__e're surprised that no one really had a crash. If someone was to have a crash here, it could be a pretty huge crash. Especially like Turn 10_11, before you go onto the Strip. Even that, going flat, even the tiniest kinks, was pretty sketchy as well__ven on lap one. So, yeah, not the nicest of challenges for Formula 1, but it__ the way it is. Yeah. I mean, Gil was in some ways a little mentor to me__rom his experience of being a racing driver, a pretty damn successful racing driver. And then, when he joined McLaren, he was one of the key parts of the big turnaround that we had over the last three, four years. He was one of the guys that was just next to Zak and Andrea, so very high up, guiding, advising, giving his experience, trying to help out as much as possible. And I think one thing you always got from Gil was just honesty__hether he made you feel like crap or he made you feel good, he was always just pretty honest. And he was the kind of guy that you could always accept those kinds of comments from. If you had a bad day, he would say, ""That was pretty bad."" But then he would understand the experience of things, the mentality of you as a driver, and he__ be able to help out. And he helped me for sure in many different situations over the last few years. So yeah, it was sad when we lost him, because I__ sure he__ be very proud of where we are today. He was very much part of our family at McLaren. And I would have loved if he could experience the two Constructors_ Championships that we__e got now, and obviously, for us as drivers, fighting for the Drivers_ Championship. He was a very special guy that achieved a lot in his career and was very helpful over the last few years for me as well. And just one of the guys you could always have a good laugh with__ven when you didn__ have to talk about racing. You__ just talk about life, or parties, or whatever it was__ife away from Formula One and the track. He was always a great guy to hang out with and have a good chat with. So yeah, I miss him. And therefore, in his home in Brazil, it was nice to think of him again. Yeah, but I look forward to it. I'm excited for it. He__ been quick and if you expect anything less, then you don__ know what he__ capable of. So yeah, I expect a battle. I expect a battle through the whole race. But at the same time, I__ here to win. I__ not here to not take risks. I still want to go out and win tomorrow. So I__l be making sure I can do everything that I can. But it__ still one step at a time__et a good start, good opening lap, that kind of thing__nd just go from there.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"It was really, really slippery out there. It's already slippery in the dry but in the wet _ yeah, it's not fun, I can tell you that. I mean, I like to drive in the wet. This felt more like driving on ice, so it took a long time to get the tyres to work a little bit. I do feel that maybe we were a little bit more competitive on the extreme tyre, but the track is improving, so you have to move on to the inter. And I struggled a lot just to have any kind of grip. And for the final lap, you risk a little bit more, but it was still, of course, by far not enough to fight for first. But still, to be on the front row, I think is good for us. The lap felt alright. It's just super difficult out there to get all the braking zones right and be on the limit of the tyres as well. But we did it. So, excited for tomorrow. I hope the inside is okay in terms of grip. But, yeah, we'll see. Yeah, the visibility was also very tough. With these cars as well, with the ground effect, there's a lot of wake that gets kicked up from the floor. So when it rains, there's a lot of water and spray, and that's why you always want at least, like, eight seconds. And I know it's a lot but otherwise, you don't really see what's happening in front of you. Yeah, it was super slippery. You know, it felt like ice. To be honest, not a lot of fun to do. I mean, I love driving in the wet, but this for me is a little bit too much, I would say. You just have to be super careful. And honestly, I was surprised there were not too many incidents. So everyone was behaving, I think, quite well__r scared. Whatever. I think we were a little bit more competitive on the Extreme than the Inter. Just super hard to do a clean lap. You have people backing out, yellow flags, locking up yourself, 360__ll of that. So yeah. We just went through qualifying without too many dramas, I would say. And to be on the front row is good. A bit unlucky of course with not having another lap, but I think if you look at the whole of Q3, we never really were in contention for pole anyway, so it's fine like this. Well, yeah. But it doesn__ unfortunately work like that. Of course the track does dry up and normally, lap after lap, you should be able to go faster, but there was no time. I think if you look at the whole of Q3, we were never up there. We were never first, we were never quick enough, and to be second is fine. It's a bit difficult to say. We didn__ really do any proper long running. In FP1 I did a little bit, which was not entirely to my liking. So I hope with the changes we've made since then that it will be a little bit better. But I__ not expecting it to be amazing. I hope we have a chance to do well. Yeah, perfect explanation from both drivers.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"I mean, I'm always optimistic. You know, a dream is for free and I always try and think about myself doing well. This track maybe suited our car in the dry, and in the wet in FP3, we didn't look very promising, but we did a few changes to the car that I think helped in the wet, and that allowed me to _ from the first lap of Q1, every time I was finishing the lap, I was P1, P1, P1. On Ex-Wet, I was really, really quick. On Inters, I knew the others maybe would catch up a bit. But, yeah, happy with P3. Yeah, a bit like in Austin _ massive cheer from the US fans for me every time. I don't know how to thank them, because every time I come to the US, I feel massive support from everyone. So, yeah, thanks a lot, truly. I think the US fans love a bit of an underdog, no? An underdog fight, and I think they see myself with Williams as an underdog but also as a coming project. We're becoming stronger every race, every lap that we do together, and it's great to see people behind us supporting us. And, yeah, would have loved to give them pole today, because that would have been a massive cheer then. But we were just not quite there. Thank you. Yeah, it was a very good lap. I thought it was a pole-worthy lap. When I closed the lap, I saw myself in P1, and then I realised I was the first car across the flag. And yeah, maybe that was not going to last very long with these two guys coming behind, but it felt like a really good quali. If anything, I think we were more competitive on the Extreme Wet in Q1 and Q2. I wish it would have stayed Ex-Wet because that was the tyre that gave me the best feeling and the best confidence. Every time we were hitting the board, we were P1. But yeah, on Inters I was expecting to go slower given our FP3 performance wasn't great, and in the end it turned out to be just fine. But yeah, in the end, it couldn__ be. Yeah, I've had a good feeling. It's just been very disrupted and we__e never been able to show ourselves or show our pace in the top of the timings. Obviously in the dry, I don't think we would have been more than P6, P5, P7, P8 in that range. The wet allowed us today to shine a bit more and to lead through stages of Q1, Q2 and Q3. I don__ think in the dry that would have been possible, and I don__ expect if the race is dry tomorrow to be able to hold on to P3. But I think in the wet, we were definitely quick. I said that in Baku. But in Baku, the Mercedes, the McLarens were starting a bit far back. To be honest, I haven__ looked at the timesheets. It__ an easy place to overtake here. Let__ see what I can do. Yeah. I went straight in Turn 5. I did one of the 180s that people have to do around here. I knew I was generating a yellow flag at the time, and I was just trying to get the yellow flag to stop as soon as possible and get myself back onto the track. I guess Lance had a yellow flag with me, so I tried to rejoin as heavily as I could and tried to avoid giving more people a yellow flag. But I think we were all on build-ups, trying to get the tyre into temperature, all doing mistakes. It was the beginning of Q1 when I think some people were still on inters, struggling to keep it on track__nd that was me. Visibility also was extremely poor. Just trying to explain it to people, it's very difficult because I don__ think people know how tricky conditions actually were today. How little grip we had with the low-downforce wings, the low-grip tarmac, the cold tyres. I think in lap one of Q1 when we all went out on Inters, the tyres were just getting cold, and we should have been on extremes. We all boxed for extremes. Those were the two laps where I was expecting three red flags in a row. because I couldn__ even keep it flat out on the straight. I couldn__ see. I couldn__ see the white lines. I couldn__ see people in front. I couldn__ see people behind. It__ chaos. And no one enjoys those moments, because when you cannot see and you don__ feel the grip, it__ very, very difficult. But then when it comes to Q3, I think it__ more we__e doing incremental margins__rying to predict how much drier the track is and how much extra grip we__e going to get. But you__e not braking more than, maximum, five metres later, three metres later, which when you arrive at 350, it__ not like you can judge very well those three metres__ou__e just guessing. I think it will be more down to the pace rather than the risk that anyone can afford. I__ also starting up front, and it__ a pretty good result if we can bring it home. So I think we__e all more or less in similar positions. For me, it__ more about trying to hold on to that P3 if I can, given that there will be very fast cars coming behind with the Mercs, the other McLaren, Ferraris that were strong in the dry. So yeah, I__ gonna give it my best shot. I mean, you saw me in Baku or in Austin__hen I__ up there fighting for the podium, I just try not to make mistakes and see if I can make myself as wide as possible and see if we can bring home a stronger than expected result. And I__l be pushing to make it happen.",Las Vegas,post-qualifying,Williams
Lando Norris,"Yeah. It's crazy. It's a big number, matching DC [David Coulthard] for amount of races with McLaren as well. So it's not just races in Formula 1 _ it's 150 with McLaren. So Qatar will be 151. So the most... I don't know what the word would be... most ""racing-est"" driver for McLaren _ whatever it is. So that's cool. That__ something I__ pretty proud of. It's quite an achievement. But yeah, 150 in F1 _ like, this is my dream, you know? It's been my dream since I was a kid, so to get that far, to get one is pretty incredible, but 150_ Time certainly flies. But I still remember Australia 2019, I still remember being on the grid there and the lights coming on and everything. So it doesn__ feel that long ago. Lowlight is tough to say. There are always tough moments in everyone__ career. Don__ know what that would be, but certainly the last couple years for us as a team... Silverstone this year is probably my proudest achievement in terms of winning at home. It__ the one race in my career that I would want to win _ at home, in Silverstone. So I would pick Silverstone as the proudest moment. My parents down there, the team, my fans, the grandstand _ that was a moment that really brought me back to my childhood but also made me feel on top of the world for a few minutes. So that was certainly the best. I certainly am. Everyone knows my approach is still just one race at a time, and I'll treat it like that until the very end. I__ enjoying the places I__ going, I__ enjoying the people I__ doing it with. I__ certainly enjoying every session, going out and obviously always trying to win. It's always sweeter when you end up on the podium or you can win the race. It's always a better feeling because that's what we all want. So it's been a good few races recently. And it is hard at times when you're fighting and you're in the position that we're in at the moment as a team, between Oscar and myself, to sometimes step back and realise what you're doing. You're so just in the moment, in the headspace of, you know, ""What can I do next time out? What can I do in practice, quali, the race?"" Whatever. You don't often step back and go, ""Oh, I__ in Formula 1. I'm fighting for the championship. I'm traveling the world."" You forget those things sometimes because your mind is so buried in what you're trying to achieve. So yeah. But the moments when you're reminded of it or you do take a step back, it's pretty insane because I'm lucky to be here and even luckier to get to fight for the positions that we__e fighting for. Well, I have to be. Apparently, I'm not allowed to say we're not favourites anymore. So, from the last two years, it__ certainly been the hardest race of the year that we've had. So my expectations are not to the same level as Mexico, Brazil, where we've been performing very well for a good amount of years. But we've had an excellent year and we've improved in places that we__e struggled in the past. So I'm certainly coming in with more confidence than in previous years, but not the same amount of confidence as going into the past few races that we__e had. So you never know. Expectations are still high. I'm still coming here to win and to want to repeat the last few weekends that I've had. But I think it's going to be trickier for sure than the last couple. What did I do? I don't know if I should say or not. Alright. I mean, because we were so bad, I just ended up trying as much stuff as I could. And it was more just _ actually, I__ not going to say. I__ fighting for a lot, so I want to reveal the least amount possible. But I think we were so bad that you just get to a point where you try a lot. I mean, it__ probably not too difficult for people to figure out. But yeah, it__ a long race, a lot of laps, and we were struggling consistently with the same thing. So I was just experimenting with a lot _ experimenting with my driving, with driving styles, approaches to the car, which is not always easy, trying to figure out how the car likes to get driven because it changes every weekend, and with the toys and things like that. So it was more... Yeah, it took us to the end of the race, the final stint, to really try and figure out what was a bit better. We found pace. Like, even if you look at the race trace now, you can quite easily see the final stint from me was a lot more in line with Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes. I think Lewis_ last stint last year was pretty incredible. So we__e still quite a long way off what the Mercedes was, but we looked more raceable, let__ say. It was just too little, too late. I think we__e learned from that. Doesn__ mean this year__ going to be mega, but it__ certainly given us a direction to go in. So it__ more experimenting with different things. But I__ not going to tell you. So, yeah, you can try to figure it out. I don__ know. I think because of the weekend that I had last time out_ I don__ know what the points swing was prior to Brazil and then post-Brazil _ or even if you say prior to Mexico and then post-Brazil _ it was a lot of points. And I feel like I've very much been on top of a lot of things the last few weekends, but it's a very difficult level to perform at all the time. And I have incredible drivers that I'm up against. So, you know, my expectation for myself is to try and perform at the same level, but that's not always a guarantee. And I know that it can also just change very quickly _ whether it's because you get unlucky or whether you're not performing at the perfect level and the guys I'm up against can perform at that high level. Things can change very easily. So, of course, I feel maybe a little bit more in control, but at the same time, you're not in control of any of these situations. And I'm not thinking of it apart from just going out and taking one session at a time, maximizing FP1 and then FP2. And as long as I treat it like that, it doesn___ I don't feel like I'm in a different position to what I was in Brazil. From the exterior, it's clear that it looks that way. But inside, I think it's treated as completely normal and just keep going as I am. It's hard not to do a better job than what I was doing at the beginning of the season. I certainly struggled at the beginning of the year, and we've changed some little things on the car that we think _ not all of them are even guarantees. We've spoken about that in previous races and stuff. But the things with the front suspension and steering _ some of it, we think it's better, we think it's going to help us and help me, but it's not a guarantee. So that's helped at times. And even when we put it on, it wasn't like, ""Oh, this feels way better."" It was more like, we think it's better. If you don__ feel anything, we'll just leave it on because we think it__ better. But the rest of it is more up to me and just trying to figure it out myself and with the group of people that I have around me _ my engineers, my full team. So I certainly feel like I'm doing a much better job. I certainly feel like I'm executing laps better in qualifying and performing very well in the races _ good starts, good restarts, all of that, the smaller things, let's say. So I__ definitely doing a better job, but it's not come without the work behind it all. I mean, I would love to say yes, but it's not, you know? It's just a constant amount of work that I do with my team to always keep finding little things. It__ not like I__e gone out and said, ""This is how the car needs to be driven."" I still struggle now. One weekend to the next, it changes. Mexico, Austin _ completely different feelings. Brazil _ again, completely different feelings. So, it's not like you figure it out and then everything's easy. I still, every weekend, just have to adapt a lot to how the car wants to be driven. But there was never one thing. It's just a lot of things that I__e been doing on the simulator. I__e been spending time with my team trying to figure out and adapt to having better procedures of working through FP1, FP2, FP3 _ to try and understand more about the car and the way it needs to be driven. So I__e just had to step up more than ever in terms of my work ethic, my understanding of all of these things, get more out of the people around me, and then get more out of me at the same time _ and just work more than I ever have done before. So, no magic thing. Just work away from the track. No. I think the reason you see less videos is because we both asked to do less videos. We__e racing drivers. We want to come and drive, not make videos for social media. So yeah, that__ our request as drivers. But we still get made to do plenty. Otherwise, it's still the same. And I'm very happy _ I think we both are _ that that's how it is. It's not because that's just how it is, it's because we both have a lot of respect for one another and we both understand the position that we're in. You know, I think it's a challenge for everyone. One thing I__e learned is everyone complains about the car _ no matter if you're in the quickest one or the slowest one, you're at the front of the grid, back of the grid. We complain now, and we have consistently the best car. Yeah, like, everyone always complains whether you're first or last. That's just what we do _ we do that very well as drivers. That's our specialty probably more than anything. But yeah, I think a car can be very quick, and can always be very quick, it's just sometimes very difficult to kind of put it in the line that it needs to be. And we__e certainly opened up that window of workability and drivability this season, and that's what's allowed us to be a lot more consistent at a lot more places. But it__ still very difficult. And like I said, it changes a lot, track to track. One weekend I have to drive like this, the next weekend_ I mean, I win this race, maybe the next weekend I try and do the same thing because it worked, and I__ way off the pace and just clueless for a minute in terms of understanding how I__e got to do it. So now I'm able to judge things better and work these processes out faster. But I mean, Vegas again is just a whole different ballgame in terms of cold, low grip. I always struggle a lot with front graining. I feel like I'm probably worse on the grid with it. I'm definitely better now _ I think I probably used to be the worst on the grid. I hate it. I hate understeer. I hate the front not working _ those kinds of things. So, and that's something that can happen a lot here as well and has done in the past. So, you know, as long as I can combat those things _ I know those things very clearly, I know I have to work on them. And once you start the weekend like that, then you can be more confident. But, like, if I go out tomorrow and FP1, FP2 and I grain the fronts, I__ not going to be very happy when I come in. And you__e going to ask me in the pen tomorrow, and I__ going to probably say it__ been a crap day. So, you know, there's all these things that I have as the expectations of it, but this is a different track altogether. Low downforce, long straights, difficult braking zones, difficult to be consistent _ and that's never a nice thing in our car. But we changed a lot of stuff on the car this year, and it might be that we turn out to be the best. So we__l wait and see. No. I mean, what's done me so well the last few weekends is by going flat, staying out of trouble, staying out of the chaos behind. It__ almost a safer bet in terms of pushing. So I think it's not the right mindset to have. I come here this weekend to try and win. I__l go to Qatar to try and win. I still treat it as if I__ not in a championship _ I__ just here to try and win this weekend, and that__ the mentality I__l have. Of course, when you're on track, you make different decisions depending on risk levels and things like that. But I feel like my judgement of that generally is pretty good and pretty accurate. So I__ happy. Yeah, for me, it's another race weekend. Nothing changes because of whatever points I__e got. Yeah. This could easily be like a 10-minute answer, so I__l try and keep it short. Good group of people around me. It's probably as simple as I can keep it. I have a very strong _ and I__ very proud to have _ a very good group of people around me to support me, to direct me, help me in all of these different cases, whether it__ been a good weekend or a bad weekend. People who always have my best interest at heart and are there to especially keep me and give me the right mentality when I__ down and I__e not had a good weekend. So I feel like two reasons I__e done well are: one, I__e done a better job, so I__ performing better more often; and two, I__ not always more positive, but I__ more positive and less negative about when I have bad days and bad sessions. And I believe in myself a bit more that I can turn it around. There__e been a lot of races this year when I__ like _ I get post-qualifying even, and I__ a bit lost. Especially at the beginning of the year _ just off the pace, don__ have an answer, don__ have a clear, ""Okay, tomorrow I need to do this and I__l be fine."" I__ just_ timings of things are off, I__ not driving well. But then I turn it around _ and I turn it around either into qualifying from practice, or I turn it around onto Sunday. And I__e done that a good amount of times where I got to a point where even if I have a bad weekend now, I__ like, ""Well, I__e done it before against all the best drivers. I__e been off, and I turned it around come the time it matters."" And that__ a very reassuring feeling that I need. That is always very welcome, I think, as a driver to have when you__e inside the car _ is that ""I__e done it before, I can do it again"" kind of attitude. So there__, again, not been a key thing. There__ not been a ""this"" or ""that"". But like I said, a lot of work away from the track with different people. A lot of work at the track. But it all starts with my team around me. Yeah. I just _ I mean, it__ cold. I think that__ the biggest thing. It__ cold, same as previous years. So just like I said before _ graining and things on tyres is not going to be an easy thing to understand. No. I actually _ let__ say in terms of where I am now, a lot of the result of where I am now is from a mental side. A lot of it is _ I'm in this position because of the beginning of the season. Like, I__ almost happier that I had a pretty crappy beginning of the year _ bar obviously a couple of races in Australia and things like that. But those difficult times certainly allowed me to focus, and I started to do a lot more work on all of those things to improve them, which has led me to be in this much stronger position that I am now. So there's not been a moment. Actually, I think even if you go back to probably my post-race interviews in Zandvoort _ things like that _ I was pretty upbeat. Not upbeat or happy with what happened, but for the position I__ in, fighting for the world championship, going in whatever it was _ 35 points down or something _ I wasn__ too deflated about the situation. I was obviously gutted and not happy, but it wasn__ like I came in and I was just deflated about everything. Even on Saturday _ Oscar got on pole by one hundredth, I think, split us. Tiniest of margins. Again, it wasn__ like I was like, ""Game over."" I was still pretty upbeat about things. The race pace was still reasonably strong. So I think it was prior to that. Everyone says and refers to Zandvoort as being that moment that turned things around _ but already prior to Zandvoort, I think I started to be on the right track. Zandvoort, I would have finished second. Oscar was always going to win there, but that was just a big step back in terms of positioning. But the change had already started by that point. So I think by the time we got Zandvoort out the way, it gave me a bit more time to kind of refocus, and then it was more evident _ which I think is why you probably use Zandvoort as that turning point.",Las Vegas,wednesday,McLaren
Franco Colapinto,"Yeah. I think generally the car has been feeling a lot better. Brazil was a step in the right direction. I think Pierre did an excellent weekend and it was very positive for the team to see the car back in the points, to see the car back up there fighting for good positions _ having the pace to compete with other teams was very exciting to see. So I think here, it's a track that is very different, very specific compared to previous races. The tarmac is very tricky as well. So, you know, not really expecting anything amazing, but I think Pierre had a really good weekend here in _24. So it__ looking good. I think we improved a lot compared to Mexico, to Austin, and with some good steps in the right direction. So let__ see where we are at. But yeah, of course, looking forward to what we can do here. Yeah. I think you're seeing a heat of the moment after the race. So the incident with Guanyu _ I was just behind, and I just saw the moment. But of course, sorry if it affected him, of course. I was in the heat after the race, and yeah, hopefully it's all good between us. But we've been spending a lot of time together on track in the races. We've been very close to each other, and we had some close fights. So, yeah.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Alpine
Esteban Ocon,"Yeah. I mean, since we've brought the upgrade, the car has been coming into much better form since Austin, and we've been able to get some good points as a team. So yeah, looking forward to seeing what we can achieve. Obviously, it is a weekend here that I really enjoy. I finished fourth here two years ago, so it was a good memory. And it is one that brings opportunities. A lot happens in Turn 1. It__ very difficult to get the tyres up to temperature, so you can make the difference with that quite a bit. We don't know if it's going to be raining also at times, so that could be a first. I mean, there__ a lot of things that will come into play, but I really look forward to seeing what this car can do here and if we can get the same performance as in recent races.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Haas
George Russell,"Yeah. Obviously, last year was a great race for us. The car definitely performed very well in these cooler conditions, but we've also got to be realistic that success a year ago doesn't mean you're going to have success a year later. We won in Singapore this year and had a terrible race there last year, in 2024. So it doesn__ mean it's going to be the same case this weekend. I think, you know, the likes of Red Bull have made big improvements on their low downforce setting as well. They won in Monza, won in Baku. So I expect them to be strong too. Yeah, definitely. I mean, everybody's objective is to make a car that's strong over the course of a 24-race season. Last year, we had a car that was exceptionally good in those cooler conditions, and I think that's why as a team, we had more victories, but we were further away in the championship. We finished fourth in the championship last year. We're fighting for second this year. So we do have a car that is stronger across a range of circuits, but it does potentially mean we won't be as competitive. It swings so quickly, to be honest. You have a good result as a team and get a one-two, for example, and that can swing so quickly. We came away from Austin, Mexico on the back foot, not performing well. But then in Brazil, we picked up a load of points as a team. So again, not being complacent, just taking it race by race. And, of course, our goal is to finish second, but we also want to win again this season. I think these next two races are the best chance. Yeah. I mean, it's flying by. I've obviously got some more races to do to catch up with the guy on my right. But yeah, I think highlights _ probably just the first race, you know, reaching this dream for all of us. There are so many races now. The season's relentless. And it's only when you achieve these sorts of small milestones that you recognise that we are living our dream. We all dreamt of being Formula 1 drivers when we were younger. And as I said, when you're in this competitive spiral week after week, you sometimes forget the position you're in. So moments like this give you that small time of reflection. Yeah. I think every time it rains, it offers an opportunity. And I think, ordinarily speaking, you're ready for that opportunity. Of course, for us, if we were to pinpoint one race on the calendar where we thought we could fight for victory, this would be the race. So out of all of the races, I would choose for this one not to be wet. But nevertheless, I still feel good, and I think _ yeah. As Fernando said, it's going to be very cold. The tyres will be difficult to switch on. Street track, white lines, a bit bumpy in sections. So it'll catch people out, and you__e just got to make sure you're not one of them. London, I guess. I don__ think anybody could imagine a street race in London, but nobody probably could imagine a street race here in Vegas. So yeah, I__ like to see that. Fernando Alonso's go-kart track. Honestly, no. I don__ think so. If I took Mercedes out of the equation and I were to try and guess who would win this weekend, I think this would be a circuit where McLaren would struggle more than usual. When you look at their performance in Canada, it was the only time they weren't on the podium, and their performance in Baku _ the only [other] time they weren't on the podium. This circuit has some similar characteristics to those tracks: the coldness, type of tarmac, the C5 tyre. And obviously low downforce _ Baku is the same as Las Vegas. But, you know, there are always these surprises. I think it's so close in Q3 now between so many teams. If you can do a magic lap and you can start on pole position, your whole weekend changes. So they'll be there or thereabouts, but I think Red Bull probably have a better chance. I think it__ very difficult. The guidelines have to be guidelines. There__ a bit of a wording or a view that if a car is locking up, it__ deemed to be out of control. This corner in Brazil is totally cambered into the corner. The inside of the car is always going to be unloaded, and that tyre is not even on the ground. So that tyre is locking, but you__e totally in control. That__ why it has to be guidelines, and you have to treat every single corner, every circuit, every incident totally different. And it goes back to the same point _ if we have the same stewards race after race, we can have these conversations and explain to them some of the uniqueness in driving a Formula 1 car at a circuit like Brazil in a corner like Turn 1, where the tyre is going to be locking up. But it doesn__ mean you__e out of control. So, look, it's very difficult for the stewards. They do their absolute best. And, you know, the majority of the time they get it right. There__ always going to be the audience that say they get it wrong. But, yeah _ not easy.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Mercedes
Fernando Alonso,"I don't know really. I think, yeah, it depends a little bit on the weekend. Lately, I think Haas is scoring a lot of points, and probably we need to focus on that as well _ not only the guys that we have just in front of us. Also, the people behind are pushing. So yeah, it's going to be, I think, tight until Abu Dhabi, and we will do our best starting from this weekend. Let's see. Following George's comments that last year in Singapore they were bad and this year they won _ in Vegas, definitely we were struggling last year. So maybe we fight for something! But yeah, I think it's going to be tight always. Qualifying will be stressful _ Q1, Q2, hopefully Q3. And then in the race, yeah, we have to see. Last year, I remember that  graining was an issue on the tyres, so we have to try to mitigate that in the setup tomorrow in free practice. Weather as well _ rain yesterday, a little bit more rain today than expected. So yeah, we should be open for anything. Not fun. Not fun at all. Yeah. It's fast. Visibility is going to be a challenge, I think, under the lights. And also, the grip level is very low already on dry tyres. Temperature is low. So it could be fun to watch, but not to drive. Yeah, my hometown. And my go-kart track, making it a bit bigger. It__ unthinkable, so maybe
this place was unthinkable as well. Difficult to say. I think we saw this year that a couple of circuits where we had high hopes, we underperformed a little bit. And some others, we were surprisingly fast. So difficult to say which one of the three will be better for us, but we will try in all three of them. Obviously, it has been a very different season compared to the past, as the 2026 regulations are a big change for everybody. And 2025 was, yeah, a season in the middle of nowhere. And, you know, we couldn't probably put the job into the 2025 car we wanted. And the base car of 2024 was not maybe the best. The second part of 2024 was not really competitive, and that was unfortunately the base for 2025. And then, as I said, with 2026 being a lot of focus for everybody, we were struggling to find the path this season. So, yeah, it has been challenging for Aston for sure, and we are not happy with the season. But, yeah, it was a complicated scenario, I think. I don__ know. I mean, I think, coming from countries that are not really into F1 so much _ especially Spain, I would say, because Jos was already a master. In fact, I raced with Jos a couple of years and with Max eight. And, yeah, I mean, it is a tough environment. And when you come here and you are _ well, you have some success at the beginning of your career _ maybe you are not the good guy, if I can say. Maybe you are not politically correct. You are not in the system. You are more yourself than what you should be. And I think it__ what I saw in Max as well. And obviously, apart from that strong personality _ the results and the talent, not only in F1, also in the junior categories and from karting already _ we all knew that he was this kid coming. So, you know, in my case, I had always a lot of respect. Difficult to know your own performance _ if it has changed somehow, if you are better or worse _ as long as you don't have a competitive car and environment that, you know, probably wakes up your feelings and your competitive spirit. That is a little bit not ready now, you know, when you are not fighting for big things. But 2023 was a good example of that _ when the car was up there in the podiums. So yeah, I have self-confidence. I have a lot of trust in the team that next year we can put things right and fight for something more important. And, yeah, as long as I feel competitive and I feel fast, motivated and physically at the level, I will keep racing. I will not miss this generation of cars, I think. But I think next year, probably, we will go slower, and we will miss them when we drive the next cars because we always want to be as fast as possible. But I think these cars are definitely too heavy. They are too big. And the ground effect and the ride heights _ we are racing in a way that is not really fun to drive and probably not even to follow cars. The expectations of this regulation, that it was to follow closely and to have better action on track, was not really a success. Maybe the first year a little bit, but not after that. So, yeah, I don__ think we will miss too much of this.
GR: Yeah, similar to Fernando, really. I think they haven__ been the most pleasant generation of cars to drive. Super stiff, really low to the ground, which has caused a lot of challenges. And of course, since 2017, the cars have been huge, and I think that has created some other challenges. So I think we__e all looking forward to a change and a fresh start _ that__ always exciting. I think it__ going in the right direction _ making the cars smaller, lighter. Maybe it hasn__ gone quite far enough. But as always, you__l miss _ you always remember the good stuff from something in the past. You never really remember the bad stuff. So I__ sure we__e going to miss that high-speed performance and we__l probably forget about the negatives, but that__ just how life goes.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Well, I mean, looking back at Brazil, yeah, I guess so, because the race pace was pretty decent. Of course, I would have liked to start more up front, but at the same time, it was fun. I had a good time out there, you know, racing through the pack and fighting basically until the final lap. Of course, it was for P2, but it was still _ yeah. I had good fun, and I hope that we can be competitive this weekend. Same as always. Doesn't really change. I mean, it's a lot of points, so I'm not really thinking about it too much, because there's also not much that I can do. We need a lot of luck now __il the end to even have an opportunity. So I, personally, don__ think about that. It's been good for sure. I think every season you want to try and be better, which is not always easy, but you try to be more consistent and try to really optimise everything that you can with the car. And I think most of the time, we really did that. So I'm pleased with that. But yeah, I mean, it's not where I wanted it to be for most of the season, right? Otherwise, you're fighting really for the title _ and we haven't really. So, yeah. I definitely enjoyed the highs and the wins that we did score, but at the same time, the lows were also not fantastic. But at one point _ after the summer break _ we were looking at a points gap of more than a hundred points, and it really looked like it was only going to get bigger. And at one point, we were really overturning that by quite a bit. Sure there a bit of luck in some places, but yeah, I think that's something we can be proud of _ to still score some good results at the end of the season. Yeah. I mean, if it rains, the tarmac is wet. So it's a bit slippery. I'm not looking forward to that potentially. I prefer to just have a dry race. It's already hard enough to get everything working here _ or understanding at least something. So yeah, I prefer a bit more straightforward. But, I mean, if the track floods, maybe less practice is also not a bad thing. I think, lately, yeah, the weekends seem to be really coming together very nicely. So, yeah, in that sense, definitely a bit different. But, I mean, every year you also grow and learn from past mistakes or weekends where you think you could have done a better job, and that goes for everyone. It's not only particularly Lando in this case. And what I said last year, I meant _ simple as that. There's nothing that I lied about, and it's quite clear, right, this season. Sometimes, yeah, you just need to be a bit patient and wait for your moment. I mean, with a lot of luck till the end _ but I'm not thinking about it. It's a lot of points, and I just want to have a good weekend, good weekends till the end. And then, yeah, after Abu Dhabi, we close the book, have a bit of time off, and we go again next year. North Pole. No, not at all. Just _ you deal with it. You try to be better next time out as a team. And that__ what we did. I think we really stuck together, tried to make the car faster and learn from the mistakes that we made on some weekends. And, yeah, try to be more competitive. Yeah. I prefer not to comment on that here. We're not going to solve it in here anyway. George also explained it well. No. I feel good. I mean, the food is great. Had a good dinner last night. The hotel is great. I also learned to not always speak too much _ because first of all, it__ better for myself, and less headlines. So that__ probably safer for everyone. But I have a good time. I__e been here many times even before F1, and I__e always enjoyed it. I find it a really weird question. I don__ know why that would be suddenly now _ that we closed 49 points like that? I don__ know. You can fill it in yourself. I think we__e done a very good job the last few races. What else can I say? We try everything that we can. The car has been good at some places, maybe not so good at others. But that__ it. No. I mean, they__e just great guys, and I think I__ quite open in general. For sure, it__ different _ it__ exactly the generation of go-kart drivers that I basically missed. Right? But we get on very well. They__e very keen, very fast drivers. And, yeah, when you just naturally get on well _ why not, right? I mean, honestly, I__ not really too stressed about it. If I knew everything in advance, I would have been a billionaire now. That__ just how life goes. If you would know things in advance or how to do things better, yeah, it makes your life a lot easier. But people always learn, make mistakes _ we__e not robots. That__ just part of life. That__ why I__ not too disappointed about it. I know that my team always gave it 100% from the start of the season until now. What else can you do? I mean, we really tried everything. We__e had some really great years, and this one is just not as good as the years before. But that happens. Formula 1 is a very competitive world. And in particular, one team this year has done a better job than us. Yeah. I mean, there__ not that much more to add. What I like is just Fernando__ mentality and just general personality. He__ just himself, which I think _ yeah _ is just very nice to deal with. You see what you get. And, of course, before I was in Formula 1 _ might sound a bit funny _ but, you know, when Fernando was fighting against Red Bull, I was cheering for him to do a good job. And being that underdog and still getting these results and dragging the car to wins when he shouldn__ _ yeah, it attracts you. I think as a driver, you like what you see. He__ a proper fighter, and he still is. I have a lot of respect for Fernando _ still doing it at his age. Sorry. But yeah, it__ very nice to see, you know, to have that much passion for the sport.",Las Vegas,wednesday,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Well, I did. I was pushing. An amazing race. Nice to win here in Brazil. It's an amazing track, amazing fans. And yeah, this one was for Gil [de Ferran], one of my mentors growing up a couple years ago. Yeah, so this one was for him. I'm sure he'd be very proud about it all, so I was thinking of that while we were driving. But yeah, a perfect, perfect weekend. Just ignore everyone that talks crap about you! Yeah, just focus on yourself and, you know, the team... McLaren are doing an amazing job, giving me a great car. We're pushing hard every single weekend and I'm pushing hard away from the track. So, rewarding. Rewarding _ it doesn't come easy, that's for sure. And to be honest, I don't think we were the quickest out there on track today, but glad to take home the win. No. Not at all. I mean, it's a great win, but to be honest, seeing how quick Max was today _ I__ pretty disappointed we weren__ quicker. So that__ where my mind is at the minute _ probably going to see the team, congratulate them and see where we weren__ quick enough. But that__ me. And we__l see what we can do. Obviously, not a long way to go, but it can change so quickly, like we've seen today already. So just focus on myself, keep my head down, ignore everyone and keep pushing. Well, I've been pretty satisfied the whole weekend, honestly. It's been a great day, a great weekend, all-in-all. I__ say challenging. It's not been completely straightforward. It's still been difficult out on track, but that makes it better. I think it was just a well-executed race: good start, good pit stops, good strategy, decent pace. I wouldn't say the pace was quite as good as what I would have liked today, so a few things to look into, but otherwise, every session that I needed to be on top, I was. And that's why I flew to Brazil. So yeah, very happy. I mean, I think everyone_ We're drivers, so we're always going to complain about something! The car balance was difficult. I'm sure the others will say the same. But it's a realistic thing to use. In terms of when I was a bit happier with the car balance last weekend, we won by 30 seconds. This weekend, we only won by 10 and, you know, Max was coming at us quite quickly. So yeah, the pace was not on another level and we set our standards high, as a team, as we rightly should. So to win by 10 seconds__'m going to sound like an idiot saying it__ut yeah, we just wanted a bit more. I still had to fight the car a lot to win by those 10 seconds. So, just a little bit trickier than what I would have liked. But I'm still very happy with how the weekend's gone, of course, and I'm very proud of the whole team and what they've been able to give me. Not as good. Even the last stint was not quite as strong. I thought the first stint was very, very good. But that was also the time I was on the most, let__ say, relative tyre to everyone. I think my used set of Mediums at the end was like seven, eight laps used, so not as nice as, say, a second set of new. But yeah, I think the pace on the Medium all weekend has been very good. The pace on the Softs__lright. Pace on the Hards__ don't really know because I never used them. So there's always little things. We're always looking, as a team, to see where we can do better, what can we improve on, especially when you're fighting for wins and for championships. You've got to look for everything. So that's what we're trying to do. I definitely had preferred feelings of the Medium, but we'll see what we can do next time out. No. It just feels like another weekend where I came here to try and win, to get the most points I could, and did that. I did that also last weekend. So yeah, I think neither are turning points. They're just strong results, which is exactly what I need, exactly what I'm fighting for every single weekend and every day. So just very pleased, but it's still a long way to go. So no point getting too happy or excited just yet. Hinder, for sure. I think it was our worst race last year. So I'm not really looking forward to it. We've been trying to work quite hard on improving those things. We know Mercedes were incredibly strong there last year, as well as Red Bull and Ferraris. I think we were the bottom of those four. So yeah, we'll wait and see. Obviously, we've improved a lot of things this year, so I'm not going to be too negative about it. I think there's plenty to look forward to. We know Abu Dhabi and Qatar are ones we are looking forward to. Las Vegas just a little bit less, because they've been probably some of our weakest races over the last two years. So let's wait and see. Yeah, honestly, nothing in particular. But there__ always people out there that try and bring you down a little bit. I guess it__ quite normal. But yeah, also, when you__e on a big stage, there__ a lot of people that talk and say things, try and influence other people to have effects. Even the cheers and the not-cheers__ou still hear it. It__ not the nicest thing. But I think it__ something I__e done well over the last few months. I care a lot about people__ perspectives and how I__ portrayed and things in the media. I probably cared too much__ven at the beginning of the year, I think I cared too much, and probably it was affecting me in not the best ways. I__e just learned to deal with those things better__ot by not caring, because I still always want to have a good impression. I never want to be rude or do those things. But I__l always try and make my point and say what I believe in. That__ one of the things I__e learned the most: just to be true to yourself, have confidence in yourself, believe in yourself, and speak your mind. So yeah, it__ more just keeping my head down and concentrating on myself. I mean, I__ sure he__ going to be a threat in terms of races, and you never know with the championship. So it__ pointless trying to guess and come up with these things. But with how quick he was today__eah, probably would have won if he started higher up. But that__ racing. Not everyone puts it together, and it__ easy to make mistakes in the world that we live in. Again, we maximised this weekend for ourselves, and that__ all we have to do. He__l be a threat__e always is. He__ always there, he__ always fighting, and I__ sure he__l fight to the end. So I look forward to it. No. Why do I need to think that? No, I can say what I want. I can think what I want. I'd say what I always am is__ always try and be as honest as I can be. If I don't think we're going to be quick, I don't think we're going to be quick. And I'm not saying I'm going to be 10th. I'm just saying I think it's going to be difficult to win. We were a long way off__ust go and look at the data from last year. Look at the race traces__e were miles off. There have been plenty of races where we__e not been quick enough this year. It__ not like we've won every single race and you're expecting me to say those things. I__ just giving my opinion on whether I think it__ going to be easy. I won last weekend by 30 seconds__ike, very, very easy. I won today by pushing a lot more, only 10 seconds, and Max was probably the quickest out on track today. Do I think that at a track that we've never been good at__e were very good here two years ago, we almost challenged Max for the win__e've never been good in Vegas. So why am I going to think, ""Yeah, it's going to be fine""? I'm giving my honest opinion on how I think we__e going to be. We__e never been good there, so I'm not the most confident about going into that race. Maybe I'll win__hen we__l see. But I__ not going to lie and say, ""Yeah, I__ very confident, and I think it's going to be an easy weekend,"" because I don__ think that__ how it__ going to be. So no__ mean, you're very right to have your own opinion on what you think I should say and what I should not say and whatever, but I__l do what I like.",Brazil,post-race,McLaren
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, I mean I don't know where this guy came from, to be honest. I didn't see it coming. But yeah, to be fair, I was lucky to come away with the restart, with the contact. Need to check with the car, it felt a bit weird afterwards. But, you know, still a good race and the last laps were very stressful with Max coming on fresher tyres. But luckily with free air, we were able to maintain a decent pace and to finish P2. Yeah, I mean, I found my rhythm. Obviously, when he was closing in, I raised the pace, I started to push a bit more. And yeah, I found my rhythm. And obviously, you know, with this car, with dirty air it's a bit difficult to follow, so I tried to use that to my advantage and yeah, it paid off. Way too stressful. I mean, obviously, when Max did the last pit stop and Bono told me the gap, I was like__h well, I cannot say because they're going to fine me now__ut I was like, ""I might be in trouble,"" you know, because he was just nine seconds behind. And obviously, he was on new Softs, so he had... I think this race he had very strong pace. He did an amazing job coming back and he just put me under a lot of pressure at the end. I had to really push the tyre to the limit, and it wasn't easy. But I think we did our best and I'm really happy with that. Well, first of all, the restart__ accelerated a little bit on the wet patch, so I got wheelspin and lost momentum going into Turn 1. But to be fair, I found myself in a very difficult position because I had one car on the outside and one car on the inside. I tried to brake late, not too late. The problem is I didn't see the car next to me anymore. I still tried to do a decent line for the position I was in. And yeah, ended up getting hit. I was lucky to come away like that, because obviously I hit quite hard Charles. Unfortunately, I ended his race, but on my side, I was lucky to come away with not such a big damage. I had a minor damage on the car. I think the steering wheel was not fully straight, but I was very lucky to come away with it and to be able to continue my race. Definitely. I've had a good run so far, a couple of strong races, and this weekend was the weekend where we put things more together__hich is what I need to do, especially for the team. So yeah, I've been enjoying a lot this weekend and looking forward to the next ones. Very hopeful. I mean, as a team, we said we're going to try to do everything that we did last year with the car. Even though it's a different car compared to last year__any things have changed__o it doesn't mean that if we were quick last year, we're going to be quick this year. I think as a team we'll try to put the car in the best spot possible, and as a driver I'll try to deliver the best performance possible. Do you understand your question? My question was? Oh yeah, about the track. I mean, the track is good fun. A lot of elevation change__ot easy, especially with the banking. Some corners also have positive camber, so you just need to really understand the line you have to take in order to maximise every corner. I think it__ been really good fun driving around here__hallenging, especially to be up to the pace with only one session. But I think on that side, we did the best. On my side, I tried to learn as much as possible every session in order to improve for the next one. And yeah, it__ been a lot of good fun. The support here has been incredible, and it__ been one of the most special weekends so far.",Brazil,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think the race was quite full on _ a lot of action. I had to overtake some cars, of course, coming from the pit lane. And I think our pace was quite strong over all the stints, of course sometimes it__ a bit difficult to know fully with traffic and stuff. But yeah, I mean, to be on the podium from the pit lane, I didn__ expect that at all _ even with a puncture as well in the beginning of the race, that__ why we had to box again. So yeah, incredible result for us. Very happy with that and just very proud of everyone within the team as well. I mean, yesterday was very tough for us, but, you know, we never give up. We always try to improve and try to find more lap time. And luckily, we found that again today. Yeah, I mean, you__e just trying to pass as fast as possible as well, because you don__ want to lose too much time. But then some cars are also in a DRS train, so it was not always very straightforward. But I mean, with all that, to finish only like 10 seconds from the lead, I think for us is incredible. Yeah, I mean, miles better than our qualifying, that__ for sure. Just a very strong race. I think we had much better pace. I think it was a bit colder today, which maybe helped us. The car just felt a bit more responsive. Even with the puncture that I picked up on the Hard, to then drop back to last and come through the field again on the Mediums__ think we did the right strategy at the end. Even on the Soft, it seemed like it was OK. Just when you start getting close and I passed George, you already wear your tyres a bit. And then when I was getting close to Kimi, the tyres just started to overheat and you lose a lot of grip. The Soft is a bit more difficult than the Medium for that. But overall, a super strong race. Coming from the pit lane to the podium, 10, 11 seconds off the lead__ think for us it's a very strong result and definitely didn__ expect that waking up this morning. I think everything together__et-up as well. I just felt a bit happier. And then I think also the temperatures today, a bit cooler, just felt like everything was working a bit better. Definitely better than P16, that__ for sure. Impossible to know. I mean, the Hard tyre__ don__ know if it was going to be a really good tyre. I felt fine on the Medium, felt fine on the Soft. On the Hard tyre__nitially maybe the Medium had a bit more grip from what I could see around me. But at the same time, you're all in dirty air, you're just sliding around, so it's impossible to know. But for sure, it's not ideal. To pit again, be on the Medium back in the pack fully, and then have to go all the way through the field__ think that compromised a bit that first stint on the Medium. I had to pass quite a few cars, you__e overheating tyres constantly, so that was a bit more of a difficult stint towards the end__ would say the last eight, 10 laps. But still, a very strong race for us. No idea. I don__ know. I mean, look at this weekend. Look at Mexico. Then look at the races before. So it's really impossible to know. I think so. Keep believing in yourself. In a rookie season, you go through quite an emotional roller coaster at times. Some weekends go better than others. Sometimes you have high hopes, sometimes that doesn__ work out. You make mistakes. You have good weekends. But at the end of the day, that__ all part of the learning curve. You have to make mistakes also to become a better driver, even in Formula 1. And I think so far this year for Kimi has been a big learning curve, but at the same time he__ very fast. I always saw that from every category that he was racing in. And for him to have a weekend like he had here__t was just super strong. He fully, of course, deserved to be on this podium today, and it also gives you a good confidence boost. The team, of course, is also helping him a lot to really exploit all the potential out of him. So he__ in a very good place, and that__ why it__ also good to celebrate that. Very different tracks, so it__ difficult to know to be honest. I think we__e still struggling a bit on tyres, so it will depend on track layout, temperatures. We can get it into a good window, but not always. That__ what we have to focus on. That__ what we will focus on in the coming races. And yeah, I mean, what are we_49 points behind now? So it__ also_ I mean, we didn__ lose the championship here or whatever. We lost the championship from race one __il Zandvoort. We had a lot of weekends where we simply were not quick enough. Then, of course, you have a big gap. Then we had good moments where you get some points back, but not enough. That__ how the season goes. Well, I mean, I jumped into the car, I was only just hoping that the car would be more competitive. But in the laps to the grid, it already felt better than the whole weekend, I would say. But then still__fter the start, picking up that puncture, then being last again__ was like, __y God, nothing is really going my way this weekend._ But then you just settle in. You try to do the best you can: pass the cars in front of you, try to run the optimum strategy. And it all worked out. With the team, we did the right thing. And then at one point, you're fighting for that podium__ou see it with 10, 12 laps to go. That__ nice. But at the same time, in the race, I__ not projecting something. I__ just focusing on the moment, trying to hit every lap as consistently as I can. So, yeah, besides that, of course, the message is that we found a much better feeling in the car again by changing a few bits. But at the same time, it was also quite a bit colder today, and that might also have an effect. Not in terms of trying to go faster, but more about just trying to understand what we were doing wrong and how we could do better for today. So yeah, you start to analyse everything you__e done over the weekend as well and what we have done in previous weekends. We went into a direction that we thought, __kay, that should be the way to go,_ and luckily, that was the right thing to do. And then I woke up and I was like, __ell, let__ just try to do the best we can today and try to enjoy it._",Brazil,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Thank you. Again, tough out there with the conditions. Just slippery, inconsistent, but good fun. It's always a pleasure around this track, you know. I felt good. I was under a bit of pressure because I locked up on my first lap, so a little bit more stressful than what I would have liked but I stayed calm and put it all together when it mattered. So, very happy. Yeah, thanks. Yes, I mean, we've been on very good form. The team are good at giving me a great car, of course. So, I've always got to thank the team, but I didn't make it easy for them or for myself then. I'm still having to push, Q3, run one, just locking up in Turn 1, it puts unnecessary pressure on myself, and the others are doing a good job. But I think when I'm in a good rhythm, when I can stay calm, when I can just put it all together, then I'll be on top. I learned that they're pretty quick. And I learned that Kimi pushes all the way to the very end. So, in some ways looking forward to it, some ways I'm not. I think it's going to be a big challenge tomorrow. We have to see what the weather's going to do again, but so far this weekend's been clean. So, I'm hoping they don't ruin it. Yeah, thanks. It was for sure more stressful than I would have liked, especially because we've been very quick all weekend. Just didn__ need that. I don't really know how it happened. I looked at the data after, quickly, between the two runs, and I braked earlier with less pressure, and still somehow locked up. So yeah, a bit weird. Maybe a bit of wind or something. But yeah, that certainly put a little bit more pressure on my final lap, and I saw the others improving _ but not a lot. It was just difficult again, just with the track conditions, the wind, everything _ hard to get a nice feeling out there. So again, I didn__ know if I was up or down on my delta, so I was a bit stressed. But when I went over the line and saw the lap, I was pretty happy. And when I saw no one running quicker, even happier. You never know around here. My Turn 1 wasn__ amazing. I think Kimi was purple in Sector 1 by a thousandth, so maybe a thousandth more there. There were little bits, but it's so difficult with the wind. Every lap, it changes _ three kilometres per hour, four kilometres per hour, you don__ really notice it probably when you're standing there, but it can easily make you go a tenth quicker in a corner or half a tenth here and there, and that can be a lot at the end of the day. That can be positions, it can be pole and not pole, those kinds of things. So, difficult. And sometimes you do the same thing _ you repeat, like my Turn 1 _ but you just make a mistake for no apparent reason, no obvious reason why, in the car. So yeah, difficult as it was for everyone today, but definitely not a perfect lap _ but good enough. It depends. I mean, confident in what? I think in our race pace tomorrow _ not the most I__e had. I was certainly more confident in Mexico. I think after this morning, with the Mercedes pace and Kimi's pace, it certainly lowered my confidence level altogether. But we__e still quick. We__e still got that little advantage in qualifying, and I really hope that we can continue that into the race tomorrow. But the weather is going to change again _ I think it__ meant to be even colder, which might suit them even more. And the wind is meant to change also. So it's difficult. Every track is so different. The feeling I have on one track is different to the next and those kinds of things. But I just feel like I__ doing a good job. I'm driving well. Before, earlier in the season, I would just have weaknesses, and I feel like I__e, let__ say, I__e maybe still got some here and there, but I__e lessened them, they__e not like one tenth now _ it__ two hundredths. So when I can put together the good parts and have those not-so-bad parts, things go very well. We__l have to wait and see. That__ what tonight__ for, honestly. I don__ look too much into strategy until Saturday night. So, we__l see. I think everyone has the same in common. The Soft certainly doesn__ feel like, you know, a Medium-to-Soft step. The Soft certainly doesn__ handle like what the Medium did last year. So it__ interesting. There are still some differences, and again, conditions can change everything. So we__l just do, as always, our work tonight and prepare the best way possible. None. Yeah, sometimes it's good to not take risks, and sometimes it__ just good to play it safe, bank some good points, and defend to everyone else behind you. Yeah. I__e always got told you have to be nice to people older than you, so Kimi _ be nice. And what else? I don't know. I guess everyone is unique in the way they think, but you've got to find your own way. It__ the same as me for the last few years. A lot of people tell you: you__e got to be like this, you have to do that, you need to think like this, that__ wrong, this is right. No one's right when it comes to those things. It's always good to listen to people, to take advice, but at the end of the day you__e only got to listen really to the people around you that you trust and who trust you. And yeah, find your own way of doing things and not think, __his guy did it three years ago or 20 years ago, that__ how I__e got to do it,_ because it's not how it works.",Brazil,post-qualifying,McLaren
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, to be fair, I'm a bit annoyed I'm again behind him. I mean, we're so close this morning in the Sprint as well but it was a very tricky session with the wind. Very tricky to put a lap together but still managed in the last run to put a decent lap, and yeah, happy with that. Starting P2 tomorrow. Of course, they're very fast, so it's going to be important to get a good start and try to set a good pace. Yeah, it was a very tricky session. To be honest the wind was not the best today _ it was a bit more of a pain in the ass around the lap, to be fair. But still, the last lap in Q3 was quite decent. I locked up a little bit the rear in the last corner, but despite that little mistake, I don__ think it would have been _ Lando would have still been fastest. So yeah, just not the perfect lap, but still good for P2 and we have a good opportunity tomorrow. Yeah, definitely. The pace this morning was really strong. It was also quite cold and tomorrow should be kind of the same. So maybe that can help us a little bit more. But, you know, running in dirty air is never easy. Hopefully, we can have a strong pace and put pressure on them and hopefully we can fight for the win. Well, we__e seen many races so far this season that the start and track position can play a massive role for the rest of the race. Of course, Lando has been starting very strong recently, so we need something exceptional. But on my side, I just try to do a normal start, not try to do too much, and then at least hold position. Then we__l see from there. So much. We went also to Monza _ no, I__ joking. To be honest, we didn__ change it, if I have to be fair, because tomorrow the way the wind is going to change again _ it's going to go back to what it was on Friday. So, yeah, to be fair, we didn__ change anything.
LN: They didn__ need to, because they were quicker. We changed a good amount, I would say. I don't know what is a lot and what is not nowadays, you know, but like, we never change that much _ you__e talking a little bit of ride height, a little bit of roll bars or something. So you__e talking always quite small, but let__ say probably more than I think we've changed in the past between a Friday-Saturday Sprint weekend. To stay behind, probably! Yeah, I mean, racing in Brazil has been incredible so far. The support has been incredible from the Brazilian fans and definitely that gave me a little bit of extra energy every time I go on track. It's been amazing. Also this track, to be honest, it's really special, really fun to drive, and yeah, I__ happy with it. Now we__e looking forward to tomorrow__ race because it would be good to finish the weekend on a high and bring home good points. OK. No, we definitely thought about putting the Medium in qualifying because even yesterday, the Medium felt basically the same as the Soft. The jump from Medium to Soft was very little. Also today in the Sprint, the Medium felt better than the Soft _ even in the first few laps, the grip just felt better, the tyre felt more robust, especially throughout the whole lap. So definitely, we had a thought about it because we thought that there was not much of a gap. But I thought as well that because I felt good on the Soft, I thought it would be better to keep it for tomorrow. Obviously, we have the new tyres, so that__ good _ especially for the start. So I think that was the right choice in the end. Well, the funny thing is that in all the tracks where we were meant to be good this year, we were not so good. And in the tracks where we weren__ expected to be good, we were good. So it__ unexpected. You see, there__ some weekends where the VCARB or the Haas, they__e extremely quick, so you never know. But of course in Vegas, with the cold temperature, definitely it should help the car. We saw also this year that usually with cold temperature the car behaves better than with hot temperature. So hopefully, we can have the same pace in Vegas. Definitely as a team, we__l try to do everything that they did last year in order to have a better opportunity to achieve the same performance somehow. Tomorrow, yeah, definitely it__ a massive opportunity. I think it__ going to be important to try and finish ahead of the Ferrari, to outscore them, because obviously the fight is very tight. And also, on Red Bull we can score big, big points. So definitely that__ the goal. That__ why tomorrow is going to be important to set a good pace, to try and put pressure _ but at the same time, to try and achieve the best result possible that is possible in the moment. So definitely a massive opportunity, and that__ why as a team we__l try to do our best in order to do so",Brazil,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, very good laps in Q2 and in Q3. Everything is so close that it goes from being a disaster of a weekend to a really good weekend in a matter of a few hundredths. So, yeah, I'm happy I could put everything together in Q2 and Q3. That was crucial for us because it was very on the limit. And then P3, I'm satisfied with that. It's been a difficult weekend for us. I don__ want to over-exaggerate the turnaround that we've had, because we're only speaking about a tenth and a half maybe. But the thing is that this weekend, a tenth and a half means out of Q1 or inside Q3. I think where we did a really good job is by executing everything perfectly from Q1 to Q3, because we knew that we were_ I mean, it__ been a very difficult weekend since FP1, and we knew that we would struggle to get to Q2 and then Q3. But we did everything perfect. So I'm very happy about that. We changed the car a little bit from this morning, and that helped us to do a step forward as well. So yeah, altogether, to start P3 _ I think we should be really satisfied with that because I don__ think anybody of us expected that after such a difficult beginning of the weekend. I felt it in Austin and Mexico. Maybe this weekend a little bit less. This weekend has been a very, very challenging weekend, and I think that hides a little bit the struggles that we__e had this weekend. But in race pace, we seem to be pretty strong. We were stuck behind Fernando, but I think the pace was pretty good on the one lap I had in clear air. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow. I__e had years where the car felt a little bit better than this year. But we__e starting in a good position, so yeah, if we manage to stay P3 or P2 or P1 after the start, then that will help us. Yeah, I mean, nothing to add. I agree 100% with Lando. I think everybody has their weaknesses, their strengths, and you__e got to work around them. Be honest with yourself. But if anything today, I think it's Kimi who has to give me advice, because he will be starting in front of me tomorrow. So, not much to add.",Brazil,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah. I__ very, very happy, obviously. It was a special week, full of emotions. It__ obviously a very special moment for anyone to do that step. And, yeah, Alex and I are incredibly happy. Ha, ha! Easy. Yeah, Pierre. Yeah. I think Pierre. I need to put him under a bit of pressure. We grew up together, so you__e next. Let__ say we come here neutral, just like we have approached the last few races. I think it__ important for us to not get carried away by the positive results we__e had in Mexico and Austin. We know that it was thanks to perfect execution from the Friday to the Sunday, and that__ extremely difficult to do__robably even more so when conditions are so difficult to predict, like it__ always the case here in Brazil. So, yeah, we__l just focus on the job just like we__e done. It paid off in the last two weekends. I really hope it does this weekend, but we have no guarantee, and we know that we don__ have the pace of McLaren or Red Bull. Mercedes can be very strong in some weekends, some others less, but that doesn__ depend on us. So we just have to focus on what we do best, and then we__l see how it goes. I love it. Actually, it__ not been such a poor track for me in terms of performance, so I wouldn__ say the same thing I said in Budapest earlier this year. But for one reason or another, on the Sunday, it never really went our way. But, yeah, again, what happened in the past__ don__ really think about it. And I__ sure that if we do everything perfect, we can be on the podium for the first time. And seeing how crazy of a weekend it can be sometimes__hy not even better? So, yeah, we__l see. I think it__ going to be very close. I think where I expect Mercedes to be very, very strong is probably Las Vegas. They were very strong last year, and I__ sure they will be this year. For the other tracks, I think it__ going to be close. So, yeah. We are basically equal on points. There__ also Red Bull in the fight, with Max especially, that picked up quite a bit of pace since the upgrades__ think it was in Monza. So it__ going to be a tough last part of the season. But, again, we have momentum on our side, and I hope it can continue as long as possible. It__ not good enough, no. I think when you drive for such a team, the only thing that is good enough is to win. But it__ also true to say that we are against a very, very strong competition and also teams that have a lot of history in the sport and that are very special in their own way. So, it__ not easy. But I think as Ferrari, when you work for such an incredible brand, it__ not good enough and you__e got to target winning. Having said all that, considering where we started the season and where we are now, it__ a good season. It__ a very good improvement throughout the season, as it__ been very difficult at the beginning of the year to understand exactly what we had to tackle with this new car. But, yeah, to now be fighting still for second in the Constructors_ should be our target. And for next year, we__l target higher for sure. I don__ know. I mean, I__l take both. I think if you win, then it__ obviously more likely that you get second in the Constructors_. So, yeah, it__ a very difficult question to answer. I would love to win. I think it__ really important to at least be winning once in a season where everything has been so tough for everybody. The second place is not what__ going to_ we__l probably be happier as a team after a victory, but the second place needs to be our target. And we need to target both of the two things. So, yeah, I won__ choose between the two. Incredibly engaged. Not technically, of course, but as all of us, I think we are all human and I think we are all supported by the people that are closest to us. Alex is the closest person that I have, with my family obviously. And they live the career just like we do, basically__he ups and the downs__nd they support us in the best possible way. And Alex has done that since the very first day I met her. So, yeah, she__ definitely a very important part of my life, obviously, but also of my career and the way you manage the ups and downs. Yeah, he doesn__ really understand about the ups and downs, but he__ always happy and that__ good enough. I didn__ really enjoy the first year, especially. Obviously, there was quite a bit of bouncing, and that wasn__ the best thing I__e had in racing. So, the first year wasn__ enjoyable. After that, actually, it got a little bit better on our side. Sure, it__ still stiff. I mean, I__ love to have a lighter car, but, yeah, I actually kind of enjoyed the last three years. The car got better, faster, and it__ still extremely fast in high-speed corners. Probably not as enjoyable as the previous generation of cars, but still__ enjoyed it a lot. I cannot comment about the podium view, unfortunately, but I__ sure it__ great! Probably the coolest thing is the legacy that you can still feel from Ayrton, that has been left. And whenever you come here, you can really feel how much he meant for people all over the world, obviously, but in Brazil it__ to another level. He__ always been my idol, so it__ always very special to witness that here. And the whole track__he flow is amazing. Just the way the corners are designed. I particularly like the kerbs. The kerbs are just very specific to Interlagos and the way you take them. There__ just a feeling about this track and the fact that it__ also historic__t__ just a very, very good feeling driving here. Whoever__ got the most points after Abu Dhabi. I think it__ an open fight, and I usually lose my money betting, so I__ not going to say. But I don__ think you can discard Max. I would prefer to bet after S_o Paulo and see how this weekend goes. Then we__l know a bit more with three races to go. How many points are there between them? One? I__ not sure there__ a hunter or hunted in that case. It__ whoever finishes in front, basically ends up in front in the championship. I don__ think__n a way, I won the championships in the past in the junior categories. I don__ think I ended up being so close in the very last few races. So obviously the tension needs to be extremely high. And it__ all about trying to manage that pressure and perform under that pressure in the best possible way. Only time will tell who manages to do that better. But, again, I still believe that it__ in between the two McLaren drivers. Not anymore. I hope so. Again, the momentum is with us. We__e had good last two races, which is a good thing, but we cannot really rely on the past for future good results. It__ all about starting from zero again this weekend, focusing step by step on what we can control, and try and make our processes the most perfect possible. Then we__l see where we end up. But I have no idea. I don__ know how competitive we__l be compared to the guys in front. I don__ know if the others will struggle more than expected. There are obviously lots of things that I cannot control and that I don__ really want to waste my energy on, trying to think and anticipate. We__l just focus on what we have to do. We__e done our homework back at home in order to be as ready as possible for this weekend. And I hope that it__ finally the weekend where I get on the podium here in Brazil. For now, it__ been the same. But, of course, I expect that tomorrow, once the track action starts, to see many, many Brazilian flags in the grandstands__nd probably more Ferrari flags, even more Ferrari flags than in the past__ostly thanks to the arrival of Lewis in the team. He has a huge amount of following here in Brazil. So it__ going to be special to see. But the people that used to support me still support me, so it__ great to see. And that always motivates us__o see the amount of support we get everywhere. And, yeah, we__l try and do the best possible we can for the fans here in Brazil.",Brazil,thursday,Ferrari
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, Charles gave me his ring already. I already put enough pressure! Yeah, definitely. I think it__ been the most successful track for me since I started in F1. So, yeah, my first podium in 2019, which was very special. And obviously, that double podium last year with Esteban, which came as a very nice surprise. A very particular day__uite chaotic__ut we managed to get on top of it. The first podium in F1 is always unique because it__ the first time you actually experience this emotion. So, yeah, that was a pretty fun way to end the race__he drag race with Lewis to the line. That was very special. But definitely, last year__wo Alpines, two French drivers on the podium, and the way we did it__t was definitely unique and very emotional. I don__ think so. But we__e well aware of the situation we are in. Nonetheless, we still give it our best every single weekend. And as Charles touched on earlier, this is the type of track where the weather can come into play. We__e seen pretty wild races around here. We definitely seem to have taken a step back in terms of performance. We__e seen cars like Haas, for example, bringing upgrades, even in Austin, when we stopped developing the car months ago__ut it__ OK. We know we have another four race weekends where we__l try, and then after that we__l be onto a different project. I__ very excited. I__ kind of in between two chairs at the minute because obviously this year is extremely hard for everyone in the team, and we are not competitive at all__or reasons we know and decisions we__e taken tactically. But at the same time, we still have four races to go and hopefully all these decisions can be proven to be definitely worth it in 2026__nd that__ what I believe. I__ seeing a lot of good stuff for next year__ car__ lot of work, a lot of motivation. But, yeah, it__ definitely been a long season. That__ a very good question. The way I see it is, I think the most important thing, on my side, is to keep the motivation up inside the team for all the troops. Because at the end of the day, as much frustration as I can build from not being able to bring points back to the guys on a season like we have, they are as disappointed because everybody puts their heart out there__ork crazy hours, travel the world__o give us the possibility to race with the best possible equipment that we can have. And at the end of the day, I need to really see more globally__bout the 1,500 people that we are, working at the track but also back at the factory__nd especially knowing that we__e onto something much bigger for 2026. So it doesn__ take anything away from me trying to put my best in the car every single time I__ in. Do I enjoy it as much? No. But I__ also aware of the project that I__ working for and also what__ coming in the coming years. So I__ not losing sight of the big picture. And that__ why for me, it__ important to be the main factor in motivation for every single individual we have in the team. If it gives me better results next year, I literally do not care about this season__nd it will be all worth it. Because the reality is what we could have fought for this year is still not good enough for us. And these couple of weeks or months can potentially give us a head start on some other teams and bring much better success, which is what we are seeking, ultimately. So, yeah, fully backing the team in what we did. It__ a bit drastic, but sometimes to achieve greatness, you__e got to make tough choices. Yeah, very similar comments. I__l just touch on Lance__ comments. It__ definitely been rougher for us inside the car__specially with all that bouncing and porpoising. Our backs have taken much more of a toll than what people could imagine, and what it looks like from the outside. So I__ pretty happy that we__e kind of going away from that. Driving-wise, we beat a couple of track records on some tracks. So in terms of actual driving and speed we carry through the corner__t__ pretty incredible on some occasions. Pretty amazing feeling inside the cockpit. But I__ sure there are different ways of achieving it. And I__ sure we can do better__n the weight and the way we achieve the performance. The view from the podium is what I enjoy the most around here. Apart from that, I__ not going to lie__he energy on race day, when we do the parade, is pretty unique. Still hearing people  chanting Senna__ name and all this type of thing is very unique to Brazil. I appreciate it a lot. It makes us all drivers feel pretty special around here. Most enjoyable corner? I quite like this track__ mean, they__e all pretty cool. Turn 1 is unique, so I__l go with Turns 1_2. I think it__l be between the McLaren drivers. It__ going to be tough for Max to turn it around. But between Oscar and Lando__ don__ know. Not much more to add.",Brazil,thursday,Alpine
Lance Stroll,"Yeah. I mean, I think there__ just some tracks where the car comes alive. The last few events, it__ been more challenging for us__e just haven__ been as competitive. No one stands still in this sport. I think other teams have brought upgrades and improved throughout the course of the year. So I think it__ probably a combination of all that. I think there are just some seasons there are cars you have a better harmony, a better chemistry with and it just feels more natural to drive. Some years, there__ cars that don__ suit you quite as well, and it__ just more of a battle. Ultimately though, I think this year we just haven__ been as competitive as we want to be as a team. Like I said, there__ some events where the car__ come alive and we__e picked up points__6, P7__hen the opportunities have presented themselves. I think we__e managed to do a good job on some of the weekends where the car has been competitive, but there__ also been a lot of weekends where we just haven__ been as competitive as we want to be as a team. So, yeah, four more races to go, and then next year is a new opportunity for everyone. Yeah, we__l see. Like Pierre said, the weather here is always a factor. You never really know what__ going to happen. If it starts raining, anything is possible. But, yeah, we__l see. I love coming back here. It__ a great track. I__ not going to miss it. No. I mean, I think the cars__hey__e been very stiff these last few years. The idea behind this regulation change was to make racing better. I don__ know if we really achieved that. They__e gotten heavier. They__e just been too heavy and too stiff. Even just throughout the last few years, battling injuries and stuff has become more of a thing. So, yeah, I__ probably not the biggest fan of this set of regulations. But we__l see what next year brings. And, yeah, hopefully__ mean, whoever__ going to be competitive I__ sure is going to love the regulations. That__ how it works in this sport. Fake news. Like the guys said, the passion from the fans is amazing here. They just love the sport. They love Formula 1. The energy around the whole weekend every year we come__t__ amazing. Good memories coming here_2023, we had a good weekend here. Both cars were__ finished fifth. The car was feeling good all weekend. And just every year I come here, I love the track. I love the rhythm of the track. It__ just kind of one of those old-school tracks where, yeah, like Pierre said, there__ a nice flow to it. Each corner goes into the next one very nicely. And, yeah, it__ a lot of fun to drive. It__ nice coming back. I have no idea. I don__ know. I said two races ago, obviously Oscar had the points advantage, but now they are basically equal on points__r nearly. So, no idea. Are you mathematically still in it? I was going to say, definitely not me or Pierre__e__e not going to win it. No, finished for all three of us, so there you go. It__ not going to be any of us. Probably one of the McLaren drivers by the looks of it.",Brazil,thursday,Aston Martin
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Well, Interlagos itself _ there's a go-karting track just literally next door to here. So I started racing when I was six. So basically, when I was six years old was the first time I came to Interlagos. But at a Grand Prix, I actually didn__ come to any before my F3 season. So I think 2023 was my first year in Interlagos watching from the paddock. The other years, I was watching from the go-kart track because you can actually watch if you just stand on the wall there. You can see it. It's not super legal, but... That would be great. I mean, for the team, for me, for the Brazilian fans _ I imagine it would be very, very good. So hopefully, we can score points. I think so, yeah. It's a Sprint weekend _ it's not going to be easy _ but I think if we do a good job and put the car in a good window straight away from FP1, we can be competitive. My maturity! I don't know. I mean, I just feel like when you come from F2, you're used to work with a team of, I don't know, 25 people, 30 maximum _ I__ just putting a number like this _ and then you get to Formula 1, and you have more than a thousand people working on two cars to make it run. It's literally a huge difference. I think this year I've been able to adapt, just to get used to it, go to the factory, meet a lot of them, and try to put everyone together and make it as one. But it's not easy. For me, one of the biggest challenges is to work with such a big team. And as a rookie, sometimes it's not the easiest thing. It__ too hard to judge the rookies _ as you said _ because I think we all have different cars. Some guys have better, worse, and it will always be like this. The only way to judge your season is basically looking at your teammate and performances you had. So if I look at myself, I__ very proud of the season I__e been having. It__ been very positive. We came from a very tough start of the season with the car and everything, and then we brought some good upgrades, put us in the points. Q3 _ I think I was there four or five times, something like this. So I__ quite happy, to be honest, with my season. I think it has been pretty decent. And about the best rookie, I mean, I think each of us is going to say ourselves. So I would say me. Isack will say him, and life goes on. It__ not going to change anything, this little championship for us, because we__e not here to fight for a rookie championship. Well, I think Isack has been very strong this year. But recently, I need to be honest as well _ Ollie has done an amazing last three or four races. Mexico for him was unbelievable. So, yeah, if the last three races didn__ happen, I would put Isack. But Ollie as well. So those two. He__ an incredible leader, I would say. He__ a different guy. He doesn__ like so much attention, I feel. Sometimes we even joke about it. He likes to stay on his own and do his things. But he pushes people so much in the factory. He motivates them. Everyone feels really involved in the project when he__ talking and pushing people forward to develop the car for this season, for next season.
He took a lot of responsibilities. He__ the head of the Audi F1 project. So yeah. I really like him. We get along very well. We spend a lot of time together as well, and he__ a guy that teaches me a lot. I always love to hear stories. He__ had such a long career in Formula 1 and worked very closely with Michael Schumacher _ who for me is one of the greats. He tells me so many stories about him, and I learn so much from it. So yeah, definitely a great leader, and one of the reasons why I__ in the team I am right now. I think for me it was after four or five rounds where we were struggling a bit. And then I just started putting things together, understanding a bit more the car, how to put it on the limit. My quali started to pick up. Then obviously, the Barcelona upgrade in our car made a big difference, and we started fighting for points from there on. So I think that was the moment of the season. I would say, you know, keep following your dreams. I mean, I did it. Coming from there with not a lot of support from sponsors _ it was a lot of hard work from my family to make it able to afford the steps going from karting at the beginning and then growing up in the series. It__ a place I__ proud of being from. And yeah, just a lot of hard work in whatever you do _ not only Formula 1, you know, because there are so many good things you can become in Brazil. Just put a lot of hard work into things with passion, and you can achieve anything. Well, I think he has a wife that can teach him a lot _ so it's not exactly only me! There are a lot of people from Brazil around him. He helped me a lot. We do a lot of sim together, we play games together. He__ a guy I admire a lot. He__ been working together with me since F3, helping me out there and helping me on all my path to Formula One. He speaks Portuguese very well _ so if you__e speaking Portuguese around him, he can understand. He just doesn__ talk it. But yeah, many words _ and definitely a guy that I__ proud to be a friend of, and happy that he helped me so much. The churrascaria _ the meat places. You know, that _ they come to the table with the meat and everything. I__e had meat every single day since I arrived in Brazil _ from Monday. So yeah, I miss it a lot. And a_a_ _ but a_a_ I can have it all over the world. For example, Oakberry is all over the place now, so you can find it. You gave a perfect answer. It__ the truth, you know. The way I prepare is also looking at onboard, data and stuff. Nowadays we have very good tools _ you can check lap by lap of a race or anything. Tomorrow maybe it__ going to be dry, but then on Saturday it__ going to be wet. So it__ also good for us to experience both situations like this _ in case it rains in the race or it__ dry, you have tested both. I wouldn__ say more pressure because I take it as one more race of the season. We__e done so many already. But definitely I__ more anxious for it. I want to drive. I want to feel how it is _ Interlagos and everything. But I don__ see it pressure-wise. I don__ need to perform better or worse because I__ in Brazil. It__ the same thing. I__ going to do my job, I__ preparing the same way as I did for any other race _ and have fun and go for it. I__ happy that my family is going to be around _ a lot of Brazilian fans _ and that__ for sure bringing a lot of good energy for me when I__ on track.",Brazil,thursday,Sauber
Isack Hadjar,"Yeah, you know, growing up _ to be fair, I was more of a Senna fan. Watching his documentary, watching him race here _ I remember that race perfectly, where I was, I was eight when Seb won his third world title, in the rain, in a chaotic race. I was like eight. So this race brings back a lot of good memories of my childhood. It's a place I__e never been before, except from last year, but never driven here. So I'm just so excited to get my first taste around here. I don't know, actually. I have no idea. That first lap in FP always feels different to what you expect. From there, we build a good weekend together. Obviously, it__ a Sprint weekend. We need to get in action quite quickly, set the tone fast. And yeah, there__ some rain expected as well. From a performance point of view, I think we__e more confident compared to the last two weekends. We found a few interesting things and it__ a layout that should suit our car a bit better. We have a tricky kerb-riding situation, let__ say. In Austin and Mexico, we've been struggling a lot. Our car is better on flatter tracks and more medium-, high-speed corners. There__ no Turn 2 and 3 Mexico-type of corners here. It should be a bit easier. I don__ think it__ going to be our best track, but it should help. The momentum is definitely against us at the moment. But the good thing is we're still sixth. We believe we can turn things around, keep pushing and keep our sixth place. I don__ think we can. I just don__ think we can. Sixth is good. I mean, to be honest, it__ something I__ used to. I never signed a contract or had something announced before the end of the season in my whole career. So I always had to keep my head down and keep pushing until the very final lap. For me, it__ nothing new, and that__ how it works with Red Bull. I have nothing to add _ everything he said was correct. I mean, as long as we__e not in the same car, we can__ really tell. I think we__e all doing really good against our teammates. Of course, Ollie and Gabriel have very experienced teammates. If you look at the head-to-head in qualifying, they are doing more than okay. So, yeah, I think it__ a good generation, let__ say. I mean, obviously, going to 2026 with the same current cars we have would be an easier challenge _ that__ true. But at the same time, I__ well used to this F1 environment and working with a lot of people. So there would be a lot less to take into compared to twelve months ago. But still, it__ going to make it very hard for everyone _ even for experienced drivers. But yeah, rookie season is different. Okay. Yeah, it__ quite easy to pick for me. Obviously, the first race was a disaster. So it was good to show myself _ to get back up from a quite horrific Sunday to a good run of points and competitiveness after that. So I would say so. A_a_ is very, very good. Luckily there__ a lot of footage, lots of onboards you can study. You can spend a lot of time analysing every driver from every lap of every session nowadays _ it__ quite a nice tool to have.
At the same time, we__e surely going to have both dry and wet sessions this weekend. So, one session at a time. You focus on dry when you know it__ going to be dry and then switch the mindset.
It takes a bit of strategy management too _ you can commit to tyre compounds for some sessions because you believe it__ going to rain. So it also adds a technical aspect that__ very challenging for us.",Brazil,thursday,RB
Alex Albon,"Maybe a bit more optimistic than Isack. But generally, it__ okay. I think it__ kind of a different period of the year now. We've transitioned towards next year's car quite a lot. We still want to finish fifth, but there's a much bigger focus on next year. Kind of similar to what Isack is saying. There__ a couple of specific tracks _ Austin, Mexico _ where you can see some issues with the balance of the car. Long story short, we analysed everything. We took everything off the car. The team did a great job to see if there's anything we can find. I think there are a lot of little things we've pieced together. There__ a nice reset going into Brazil. We understand where the issues came from. Now it's about delivering a clean weekend. No. I think it's merely just been a couple of tough races. If you look at the whole season, we've had a really strong year. It's more about getting back into that rhythm. Setup of the car will be very similar to how it__ been all year. There's nothing we need to think out of the ordinary to get the performance back. It__ just about getting that rhythm. Yeah. It was going great until it wasn__, and I got caught out. It__ an interesting track here. There__ a lot of rivers. Last year was very bumpy. It__l be interesting to see with the track resurface how much that__ gone away. And the tarmac is a little bit strange. So yeah, I think realistically, I would have done the same, actually. Don__ want to go back a whole year, but we found some issues that contributed to that crash. But I like it. I actually prefer this track in the wet than in the dry. I think it__ got really nice kind of different lines you can do. I think Max has proved that many years here. It__ a nice one to race as well _ just the visibility can be a bit tough. But yeah. Yeah, there is. You can almost look at it both ways, which is kind of what Isack is saying. I think the experienced drivers will most probably understand the complexity of it a little bit easier _ it may become a little more natural to them. At the same time, it is a reset for everyone. So there is a more level playing field going into next year. But I still think experience is going to help. I think these guys will have learned a lot over this last year to get themselves in a better place for next year. I find experience helps you get out of difficult situations a bit easier. That__ generally how it works. Setup direction can be on electronics, and it can be on physical parts. So the physical parts stay the same _ the electronics change. So yeah. Weirdly good sushi in Brazil. And yeah, I think we took the team out to a steakhouse _ always a good choice. The food is always good. I always talk about cities by food _ and I think S_o Paulo is pretty high up there. I think, start off by expecting that kind of weather. So in terms of preparation for the weekend, you're not just looking at onboards and data from dry weather _ you're looking at onboards and data from wet weather. You're looking at previous races if you__e been here before in the wet _ what worked for you and what didn__. In terms of general philosophy, mindset into this weekend, it__ a very unpredictable weekend. We saw last year the Alpines finishing second and third, completely changing the midfield Constructors_ Championship. You could imagine if it rains at some point in the weekend, anyone can catch us up. So there__ a lot of unpredictability _ and you always just have to stay on track. You can normally score a good result if you do that _ which I didn__. So yeah.",Brazil,thursday,Williams
Lando Norris,"Just stayed relaxed, you know? Yeah, just got a good launch. That was the best thing. I think I got a much better launch than the guys around. But man, this is awesome here. This is unbelievable. So yeah, my first win here in Mexico, a beautiful one to win__specially here in the stadium. So yeah, a big thanks to all the fans. I mean, it__ one weekend at a time. It__ one weekend at a time. So, you know, I__ happy, I__ focused on myself. I keep my head down, I ignore all of this and yeah, I keep to myself and it__ working at the minute, so I__ happy. I think it's the one where I just performed the best. I don't know, dominant or not, but it's the one where I think I've just performed best throughout, from FP2 all the way to the end of the race. In a way, I think it's just my best performance through a whole weekend. You know, all my laps in qualifying, all my practice, all my race. So, yeah. It's a good question. I mean, the car is just quick, you know. It has been the whole season, but clearly, it's still difficult to drive at times. But I think when you just find that sweet spot, it can be down the road and make your life a bit easier. So, I don't know. It's hard to say, like, what's better about mine than the others, but I've just had a bit more grip, and that's normally always the easiest answer. I don't know. I've not seen the replay or anything. I didn't know we were four-wide. I just went in first and I came out third, I think. So that was the most I saw, but I don't know. I've not actually seen a replay, so I need to go and rewatch it. But, you know, Mexico, Turn 1 is always eventful every single season. I don't know if having such a good start helped me or didn__. It definitely gave me a good length of time, with some breathing space and being able to position the car a little bit more how I need and how I want. But I still had to attack into one. I knew the others around me were going to attack, so it wasn't an easy one. But, yeah, I kept to the head and was pretty straightforward from there. I just didn't need to. I was definitely tempted, but it wasn't needed. No point for a fastest lap or anything anymore, so didn__ have to. Yep. But it's still very clear in my head. So, yeah. I mean, you put that behind you. Right? You forget about that as much as you can, and you just focus on every race coming up. Yeah, you forget about every previous weekend. Of course, you try and learn from every situation, but every weekend's new and you have a fresh start to try new things and try and do better than before. And I feel like that's what I've done very well this weekend. So, you know, the last few have been decent. This has easily been my best performance. But still a long way to go, so I just have to keep doing what I'm doing, keep trying to be consistent against some very quick guys around me. And, yeah, I think that'll be good. But it doesn't mean because I'm ahead or behind or whatever that I have to drive or do anything differently. So, just keep doing what I'm doing. I mean, first of all, I think to win anywhere is pretty good. I mean, to win here is also very special. I mean, with the stadium and everything, it's one of the coolest podiums of the season. Yeah, probably along with Monaco, Monza, Silverstone, that kind of thing. So it's pretty special. And, of course, for the first time, you know, since Senna won here, it's nice to bring McLaren back to the winning ways here, obviously, for such a long time. And to have my name anywhere close to someone like that is pretty special. So, yeah, something that's always nice to look at and I'm sure to look back on in ten, twenty years is pretty cool too. So that's great. And for the championship, I mean, who knows? It's still pretty tight between us. Max has still caught me over the last, what, six, seven weekends. So, yeah, write what you want. It__ your decision. But, you know, I've been keeping my head down, keeping focus, doing my own thing, and that's all you can do. But every weekend's new, every weekend's different, and still a long way to go. Oh, sour. I like sour sweets. I don't know why, to be honest. People can do what they want, honestly. They have the right to do it if they want to do it. So I think that's sport sometimes. I don't know why I can't stop laughing when I get booed. I think it makes it more entertaining for me. So, yeah, they can keep doing it if they want. Of course, you don't want it. I prefer if people cheer for me. But I don't know. Who knows? Like I said, I just concentrate on doing my things. It was the same in, what, Monza and a few other places. So, yeah. I don't know why. I just can't stop laughing. So, if they want to continue they can. From where? Sure. If they want to think that, then they certainly have the right to__hey can think whatever they want. Yeah. I guess from us as a team, of course, we try and do things fairly. That was the comments we made back then. The same with, you know, two years ago in Budapest when I could have won the race and had to let Oscar back through and let him win a race he deserved to win. It was no different to that really. It was an incorrect decision that we made as a team to box him first__nd, or me first here. And, yeah, to be honest, if you want to have the three points, they can. But they have the right to think whatever they want. But, yeah, like Oscar deserved the win last year in Budapest, I deserve to be ahead at Monza. Simple as that.",Mexico City,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, very happy with this weekend. The United States was very positive for us, but we didn__ know what to expect from this weekend. And to end up again on the podium is a great surprise. So yeah, very happy to be on this amazing podium once again. I was quite happy about the Safety Car at the end. My tyres were completely gone and Max was coming back on the softer tyre, so it was tough. But I think the Safety Car saved me at the end. Quite a bit. I mean, it's been a very positive weekend. I think we did not expect to be replicating what we've done in Austin. We knew that in Austin we had done the perfect execution, but we also knew that on paper we maybe didn't have the pace that McLaren or Red Bull had. And to be on the podium at that race was a surprise, but we managed to do that again and one step higher on the podium as well. So it's been a really strong weekend. I think, as we know already, in terms of pure performance from the car, it's been quite long that we've been switching our minds to 2026, and so that helped us a little bit more into this last part of the season. But by doing perfect executed weekends, we managed to get two podiums in a row, which is a really nice feeling. Yeah. I was very happy to see the Safety Car coming out in the last two laps. I think without it, there was more chance of Max getting past than me staying in front. Especially with those Medium tyres, the feeling was just not there from the beginning to the end. I was definitely tempted by the two stops, but I don't know. At the end, I just stuck to what I was on, which was the Medium tyre, and tried to make it work__nd we did. It was close. We got a little bit lucky, but I'm proud we made it stick. Yeah. I didn't enjoy that at all. I normally quite like fighting, but in this case, being in the middle of Lewis and Max it__ one of those kinds of situations where, as a driver, you cannot do much. Just pray that Max and Lewis will give me enough space just to make the corner. And I touched a little bit with Lewis. And then there was very poor grip on the outside, so I had to cut the corner. But luckily for the three of us, it had no consequences. It's going to be very, very tough. If I look back at the last two weekends, yes. If I look before these two weekends, not really. We just need to focus race by race and do the perfect execution just like we've done in the last two races. That pays off, obviously, as always, but it's very difficult to be performing at this level all the time. But that is the standard that we need to target, and hopefully that will be enough to give us second in the Constructors.",Mexico City,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was very hectic, the beginning of the race for me. We had a very good start. And then, of course, such a long run to Turn 1, and we were on the outside__eah, three, four-wide. So I had to be out of that kerb. It kept bottoming out all the way, so I almost crashed into the grass. And then even after that, there was a lot going on. Everyone around me was on Soft tyres, I was on the medium, and it looked like that was a bit of a struggle. So surviving the first stint, trying to go as long as we could on the tyres. Yeah, once we bolted on the Softs, we were a little bit more competitive, a bit happier. I mean, it__ been a difficult weekend for us, but to be fighting for P2 with everything that happened in the first few laps, I think it__ still a very strong result. I mean, you win some, you lose some, right? Sometimes the Safety Car works for you, and sometimes it works against you. No, I think it was on the wrong button. It wasn__ meant for me. It__ depending on the deg, right? So I think at one point we were quite committed to a one-stop. Yeah. I mean, personally, I didn't expect to be on the podium. And I think even in the first stint, it was not really looking like it. I mean, at the time, I thought we were just slow and struggling on tyres. I do think then, of course, when we swapped to the Soft and the others were on Mediums, it all looked a bit more competitive. I think, I mean, still not to the level of Lando if you take the average of the race, but the Soft definitely was a better compound to race on, and it all felt a bit better. So, yeah, I think overall to be P3 has been really good on, yeah, for us a difficult weekend. I was surprised everyone else was on the Soft. Not at all. Okay. So that's why I was very surprised. I had a very good start. Then you just follow the slipstream__hree-wide, four-wide. I mean, just following, of course, what the car next to you is doing. So I had to move left, left, left. And then at one point, of course, you're on the kerb and then I started bottoming out on the kerb. So that was quite hectic. And then a bit of rallying in between Turns 1 and 2. Yeah, that was quite fun. And then, yeah, got back onto the track, found my position again, and then actually, yeah, the first few laps were a bit hectic. But at the same time, also very quickly I could see that the grip was just not there, and I was really struggling actually to just follow the cars ahead of me. I mean, I lost 10 to Lando, if you look at it like that. So, I said before the weekend, everything needs to go perfect to win. And this weekend didn't go perfect. So that's your answer. I think it's going to be tough, but let's see what we can do in other tracks. I hope, of course, we won't experience a weekend like this again, but it still shows that we're not quick in every scenario. And that's what we need to understand, I think, a bit better. No, not really. I mean, sometimes the safety car has been very nice to me as well in my career. So sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. It's how it goes in racing. Would have been fun, I think, to the end. Well, maybe a bit more fun for me than for Charles defending, but it would have been a fun ending, I think, for everyone to watch.",Mexico City,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah. Thank you. I mean, I'm happy to be back on pole. It's actually been quite a long time, so a good feeling. The lap__ don't know. It was one of those laps where you don't really know what happened. It felt decent, but then when I crossed the line and saw a 15.5, I was very pleasantly surprised. So I've been feeling good all weekend, especially from today. Like FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3. I got a little bit nervous with the Ferrari in Q3 at the end, but I pulled it out when I needed, and I'm happy because of that. Not a lot. I mean, I haven__ been sleeping well lately, so maybe that__ the key to it all.  But I won__. You know, I__e had some good races here in the past, so I__l just focus on what I can control, and that__ all I can do. No. I'm here to win. No, I'll be looking forward. I know I'm going to have some quick guys behind me, and it's a long run down to Turn 1 and so forth. And the race pace from the Ferraris is normally very strong. So I'm expecting a battle. I'm not expecting it to be easy. But, no__yes forward and I__l see how much I can win by. That's the confusing thing. I mean, obviously it was an incredible lap. I pushed the braking everywhere. I pushed the high speed a bit more and all those things. But I don't have a delta, so I didn__ know if I was up, if I was down, if it was good, bad, whatever. There were a couple of little places where I thought I messed up a touch and didn't get the best exits, like out of six, but the rest of it felt pretty decent. I was happy, but I thought I'd be more like a 15.9, 15.8. I thought if I'd get ahead of Charles, I'd be pretty happy. So when I saw 15.5 on my dash, it put a pretty big smile on my face because it was one of those laps which was _ everything just came together in terms of feeling. It was very natural and similar to my lap in Monaco. A good feeling because it's been a while. It's not that often this year I get that feeling in this car, even with how quick it is. But yeah, happy because of this. Honestly, I don't know. I have to go and see on the data. Like I said, I just pushed the braking in a few little places a bit more. Took a couple of bits more risk in the high speed. But yeah. Quite often, the laps I do best, I don't really know what's happened or how it's happened. Like I said on the radio to Will and Jarv, the less I know, the better I do normally on my quali laps. So it was one of them. But yeah, six tenths. I was surprised. I got a bit worried Q3 Run 1 when Charles did a 15.9. I was like, __amn, that__ a pretty impressive lap_. So, like I said, nice when I saw 15.5. I mean, maybe. It's tough because I do feel like I__ doing a very good job. I feel like I have been for a good amount of weekends now, especially when I get this feeling that I had today. Actually, the whole day today. It__ not just my Q3 lap that was good. FP3 was strong already and a good step better than it was yesterday. Q1, Q2, Q3 _ all of my laps were good. No mistakes. No lock-ups. None of these things. And I could just, in a good way, improve. The car is incredibly quick, but it's not easy to drive. I think we both complained of that as drivers, but when you just get in that little bit of a rhythm, it's flying, and that__ where I was today. Potentially. I mean, obviously with the Hard being a step harder, that can change a few things. But the race last year was very nice and we were very confident. Our race pace was very strong with the Medium-Hard last year. So yeah, I don__ think we__e too worried about anything. I think the pace has still been decent, even with missing FP1 and just kind of getting that high fuel stuff in FP2. But you never know. Many things can happen around here. It__ a long race. Easy to make mistakes. A lot of overtaking opportunities, that kind of thing _ but the pace is there. So as long as I get my head down and focus, then I__l be fine. That__ tonight. That__ with my engineers and my team around me to review things, see what__ best. Of course, you want a good start and go from there. But it__ a long run. I don__ know what our straight-line speed is like compared to the Ferrari. In general, I think we__e been a touch down, so we__l wait and see. I mean, ask these guys _ they__e pros at it. These guys, they do it every race. Yeah, I think you always have to do it a little bit, but never as much as these guys. No, I__e not had it since Monaco. I__e never used the delta since, in qualifying. So, yeah, I don__ know. Who knows if it would have helped me or made me worse? I think the thing when I don__ have it is, I push no matter what _ no matter how the start of the lap was, no matter how any corner was. I guess it__ because you have no reference of maybe the overall lap time, you just always try and maximize every corner to the maximum. And yeah, otherwise sometimes I just stare at it too much, and that__ never the best thing. So yeah, it's just nice because normally when it goes well, like today, it__ a pleasant surprise to see the lap time pop up when it__ as good as this one. I think, even when I look at my first lap in FP2 _ my first lap of the weekend _ it__ a track which is not easy because of the downforce and the grip and things like that. High end of straight speed, big braking zones. But my first lap, I was on it. I was, again, pleasantly surprised at how quick I was on the pace compared to everyone _ to the others who already did FP1. But certainly, it__ hard to quantify how much the work the team has done behind the scenes to give me a bit more of what I want and what I need in order to perform at the level that I can perform at, which is the level of today and certain other places where we__e been this season. But it was only a few weekends ago in Singapore where I almost felt like it was the beginning of the season again _ no feeling for the front, no confidence, no ability to go out and do what I did today. No confidence to do what I did today. So it__ a little bit up and down still. There__ certainly areas we have to improve. And if I want to be able to do what I did today more often _ which I do _ we have to improve the car more. And I__e got to try and make it more to my liking. But there__ certainly a lot of work that I__e also done personally, away from the track, with my team, with a lot of people to understand what my struggles were, reasoning, all those things, and then how I can combat it. Because the last thing I want is to make the excuse. Like, at the end of the day, it__ my job to drive whatever car I get given, whether it__ a great one or a terrible one. I don__ feel like I should ever have a reason to have an excuse. There__ reasoning for things _ why I struggle here, why I__e struggled there, and so forth _ but it__ not an excuse. If I__ slow, I__l say I__e just done a bad job, and I wasn__ a good enough driver on that day. And I think I__e always been open about those things. But yeah, there are clearly things which work for me and things that don__. I hate that because I hate to have a reason for why sometimes I struggle. I just want to be able to drive whatever car I get given. But certainly, progress has been made. And I__ very happy that the team has worked hard to improve on those things. But we still need to make more if I want to be even better. Well, I think you__e talking about two of _ along with these guys here _ two of the best drivers on the grid. So I don__ think you can ever put it past them to come back through. From my side, our race pace has always been very strong this season, so I__ still expecting Oscar to come back through and race well. He normally does. So, let__ see. That is my expectation. And same with Max _ when has he ever not been on the attack and come forward? Hopefully I can just stay ahead on lap one, and then these guys can hold everyone else up for me.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"It's very difficult. This qualifying is very, very difficult, because there's very little grip, so the car is sliding a lot. And in order to put everything together, it's very tricky. But I'm pretty happy with the job we've done. I don__ think there was much more in the car. There__ a bit here and there, as always in qualifying, but very happy with the performance. It would mean a lot. So we'll do everything in order to get the first place into the first corner and then we__l see what's possible. A little bit. But yeah, after the first lap in Q3, I thought this was a really good lap. So I knew there was a little bit more to come, but not so much. But considering the gaps that were behind, I was like, __K, let__ see how it goes. I will still go flat out on the second lap and see where we end up_. But I was very surprised, obviously, by the jump Lando did from the first to the second run in Q3. I just don__ think we had the pace today to match that. There was a little bit here and there, but I don__ think it would have been enough for pole position anyway. I think the car was actually really good today. The whole weekend has been pretty strong. But on a track like this, it__ very difficult because it__ such a low grip track, and it__ very easy to make a mistake. Whatever small mistake you do is exaggerated in terms of lap time lost. So it was very tough, but I was pretty happy with both of my laps in Q3. A little bit. I think the track got cooler in Q3, and that definitely helped. The grip was a little bit higher, and I felt in some corners I was a little bit under the limit, if anything. But yeah, the car reacted well, and again, I don__ have anything to complain about car-wise. He__ got the race pace too. We were speaking about it earlier. I think he will be very strong tomorrow for sure. But the start is definitely a chance for us _ it's an opportunity for us to try and make something special even though starting second here on the dirty side of the track. I'm not sure it__ great, but it's OK. I__l just focus on what I can control and hopefully it will be enough to be alongside him into Turn 1. Let__ say I think we__e ready for this. It__ always a track where lift and coast is a big part of the race, especially for the people from second onwards. That__ why I think the start is so important on a track like this, because when you have free air, everything comes a lot easier. So yeah, we__l be quite aggressive into Turn 1 if I have the possibility and then manage from where we are. But it's definitely going to be a big part of the race. I don__ think there__ a silver bullet or something that we__e changed significantly that makes us a lot better now than three, four, five races ago. I think it__ a little bit everywhere. Like Lewis was saying earlier, I think the processes and all the small differences make a big difference at the end, and we improved all that in the last few weekends. Yeah, on the bumps, I don__ think this was particularly a weakness at any point. I think we had to manage some other things at one point of the season, which now we are in a bit more of a comfortable place. But yeah, the pace in itself is more down to small details everywhere rather than something standing out. Well, I kept a new soft for the race. So yeah, in Q2, I had done my lap early on in Q2 compared to most of the others that had put a second set. I went on a scrubbed tyre then. So obviously there was a little bit of a gap there more than anything. But the lap time came quite nicely. I was quite confident with the car, so I knew where I had to push and where I had to improve. Everything came together very nicely on that first lap in Q3 _ just like, honestly, the second lap in Q3 as well. So yeah. But I think the biggest explanation is mostly that I only put one set in Q2 when most of the others went for two. Yeah. I mean, it__ probably going to be tough. I__ rather be in my position than theirs, but yeah, they__e got the pace. Especially if Oscar finds the pace that Lando had on the high fuel, I think he__l probably have the pace to come back. But it__ obviously a lot more difficult.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lewis Hamilton,"I have no clue what you just said.  but__ou know what, I__ really, really happy. Thank you so much, everyone. I'm honoured to be up here with Charles and with Lando. These guys have been so quick all year, and it__ an amazing feeling. This is the first time we've both been up in the top three in qualifying this year and the team truly deserves it. So, we're just working as hard as we can. Super grateful to everyone in the team for continuing to push and for not giving up. You know, we've not really moved the car forward necessarily in development, but we've extracted more from it. Our process is better this weekend, and that's what you're seeing. So, grazie a tutti. Well, it__ hard to beat these two guys today, but I mean P3 is kind of the perfect spot actually at this track. So I'm hoping I can make the most of that at the start. I think our race pace is not too bad. It__ difficult to know already, but I'm really hoping_ you know, with this crowd__ know there__ going to be an amazing crowd there tomorrow, so we'll try and give it a good race. I was just saying to these guys, it__ been a long time since I__e been up here, so it feels fresh. And yeah, really grateful to the team for the hard work and just the constant effort through the year. Of course, I wish we had this experience earlier on in the year, but the fact is we__e continuing to improve and continuing to stay positive, and so it__ just great to be up here with these two. Relatively happy. As Charles said, it is a really difficult circuit. We're all sliding around in general. The grip is quite low at this circuit because of the altitude. But even with that, clearly, everyone__ experiencing the same thing and our pace has been great all weekend. I think we__e made good steps with the car through the weekend. Obviously, I missed FP1 _ I wouldn__ say that hampered the weekend, but of course, you learn more with more laps on the track. I think I got the car to as good a place as I could. It__ definitely not easy to put a lap together. But yeah, I__ just happy to be here. We continue to improve on our process _ from the moment we arrive, to our debriefs, to the decisions we make as a team within engineering, within when we going out _ all these different things. So I think we__e just continuously tightening up on some of those areas. And I think just how Charles and I have worked together to move the car and develop it forward has been really positive over the race weekends. Our cars are pretty much identical now, and I__ finally figuring out how to drive this car that Charles has been fortunate to drive for the past seven years, in terms of the characteristics. But I__ finally feeling like I__ getting there. So it's good. I don__ know. Definitely want to be racy tomorrow. I don__ have anything to lose, but he does. So I__l be_ Yeah, we__l be quite aggressive, I__ pretty sure. Hopefully we__l be close enough to put up a good fight. Not much to say. Lift and coast is pretty much what Charles said. Yeah. I mean, I second what Charles has said. I think this is a peculiar circuit, obviously, with the altitude, so we perhaps are closer than we would normally be, I would say. It__ difficult to say where we__l be in the next races. I__ not sure we__l be as close as we are. But I do think through those small improvements that Charles was talking about, that we__e made _ they make big differences. And it feels great to finally get into Q3 and be able to deliver good laps and be competitive. That__ been a problem all year, particularly on my side. Yeah, it__ beautiful. It__ really been amazing. Every time I come to Mexico, honestly, I__e always felt very welcome. I really, really love the city. I mean, I grew up watching it in movies, and it__ even more beautiful in person, I would say. When you get into the city and see the restaurants, the lights that are hanging, it__ just got such a great feel to it. And then obviously we__e been coming to this race, it__ been growing year on year, and I would say I__ pleasantly surprised to see the positive response that I get from the fans every year here. It__ something I__ incredibly grateful for. So, muchos gracias. It__ tough with the altitude, with the overheating of the car, with the overheating of the brakes. I mean, I don__ know how it is for everybody, but I__ pretty sure most people have that experience here with the lack of cooling. So it won__ necessarily be easy. But you__e got some great drivers behind us. So we shall see.",Mexico City,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. It was an unbelievable weekend for us. I knew that the race was, of course, not going to be super straightforward. I think if you look at the whole race, the pace between myself and Lando was really close. I think just in that first stint, that__ where we made the difference. I could eke out a little bit of a gap and that__ basically what we kept till the end. It wasn__ easy to manage also the tyres on both of these stints, but we kept it in the lead and just incredibly proud of everyone to deliver a weekend like this. Yeah. For sure, the chance is there. We just need to try and deliver these kinds of weekends now till the end. So just try whatever we can, you know. I think it is exciting, and I__ really just very excited for the end. Yeah. A perfect weekend for us. Today, I think what was crucial was the first stint where I could build a bit of a gap, because I think after that, it basically stabilised pretty much after the pit stop until the end. I think tyre management was very important today, and it wasn't very straightforward because there were some laps where you had a very different feeling or balance, grip _ bit weirdly, better or worse. So, yeah, it's one of those days where you just need to try and make no mistakes, try to drive it as consistent as you can, drive around the bumps as much as possible. But, yeah, for us to win again today is incredible. I think it was a bit better today, even though I think it's still not where I wanted it to be, let's say it like that. But nevertheless, yeah, we won the race, which of course is the most important. I think then it would be a very close race. Yeah. Every time I think that Lando was in clean air, we were very evenly matched. Maybe at times, he was a bit faster as well. So, yeah, it wouldn't have been the gap that it was at the end. Yeah. I think we need to be perfect until the end, you know, to have a chance. Yeah. We caught up a lot. But at the same time, you know, the gaps are very small. I think every weekend you need to try and be perfect, and that's what we'll try to do until the end. I mean, I know that we need to be perfect __il the end to have a chance, so that__ what we just need to focus on. And, I don__ know. I mean, like I said before, it's super close, and just attention to detail will make the difference. Trying to get the best set-up on the car every weekend and then try not to make mistakes. So that's what we'll try to do. Well, the beauty of it is we'll find out next week. I don't really think about it. We'll find out next week. We could speculate, but I don't like that.
LN: Probably the same as here. I don__ think it__l change that much. It__ close between us and Red Bull _ one weekend they're a little bit quicker, the next we__e a little bit faster. You know, Mercedes was quickest in Singapore. So, yeah, you can have many different things here, but we__e gonna see. No. I would have told him he was an idiot. But, yeah, we found a good way with the car. It's simple as that. Of course, we put some upgrades on the car, but we just understood our car a bit better _ where we wanted it to perform better. And, yeah, every weekend we try to achieve it. Some weekends, you know, it's better than others, but in general, it's been way more straightforward the last few weekends compared to before those races. So that's what we need to try and extract out of it now every single weekend.",United States,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Finally. Finally. It took long enough. No, it was a good battle with Charles. He fought hard. It was tough. We did everything we could. I thought we kind of had it in an easy way after we got ahead, and then we did the overcut _ or we went much longer. I expected a slightly easier second attempt to get through, but it wasn__ the case. So, no, Charles drove a very good race. It was good fun, good battles. So we have to take second. Not a lot more we could__e done today. Yeah. I mean, like, you know, out the box, when the tyres are the freshest, then you want to push because you have the best chance. But it__ also when the tyres get the hottest. So when I had my first try, I just really started to struggle with the tyres, and Charles was probably already in that kind of consistent point. So I backed off quite a bit for a few laps, went again, and it worked. So, yeah, good strategy, some good driving, and, yeah, a fun race. Who knows? What was it that you [Berstappen] said once _ __f your mum had balls_ she__ be your dad_? Yeah. Who knows. But, you know, starting on the Soft, starting on the right side of the grid_ He had the advantage in Turn 1, on the outside. After yesterday, obviously a little bit wary _ didn__ want to go too wide in Turn 1 because I didn__ want to end up in the gravel again. So yeah, I kind of had to just stay on the inside and stick to the safer route. But Charles did a good job and I got passed. Who knows after that? You know, I think I found it difficult enough just to get close to Charles, and their pace wasn__ bad at all. Until, what, 10 laps to go he was like six seconds off Max. So it wasn't like we were that far away, or their pace was that bad. So, you know, I think it was a good race. The pace was pretty close. I think that__ why it was so difficult _ because we were quicker, for sure, but not by a lot. And therefore, there were some challenging lap-after-lap battles, trying to put him under pressure, trying to make him make some mistakes here and there. He didn__ make many, for sure. But I think especially the final stint, I managed to get the tyres into a good window, drop back a few seconds, re-attack, and I managed to kind of catch him a bit more off guard, let__ say, with a couple of laps. So, a good result in the end. For a minute, I was not expecting to finish second. I thought he was just a bit too quick for us. But to get back into second and get past was perfect. I mean, I regret not putting a perfect lap and not going purple, purple, purple yesterday in qualifying. So, you know, you can't ask these questions. I mean, you could do many different things. You never know what__ going to work out. I don__ think our strategy was wrong. I think we did a good job. Potentially, we should have _ we__l look back and see if we should have just boxed as soon as we got ahead of Charles or just tried an undercut and see if that worked out. But it was a long way to go on the Soft, and then you put yourself under Safety Car risk. So, you know, there's many different things that can go your way. Otherwise, I think we did a good job. I think we took the correct amount of risk in the position that we're in, and I__ happy and satisfied with the result _ as much as I would have loved to be further up. A little bit. I mean, the places which were easy to go off were Turn 9 over the crest of the hill, and then the last two corners. I think I was on three strikes by like lap 10. So I didn't put myself in the best position. But then one of my strikes was because I was racing. You know, I think that's one of the silliest rules that we have _ we__e invited to try and race, but if you race too much, you get a penalty for it. And I got a track limits [strike] for trying to go around the outside and losing time to Charles. So, doesn't really make much sense in terms of going racing. But it definitely made my life that little bit trickier, especially Turn 19, with the wind, like Max said, it was pretty inconsistent. It__ difficult to just be always on the limit and not make mistakes _ which I obviously made a couple too many of, too early on. But yeah, a little bit more cautious at the end because I knew I couldn__ afford a penalty. But I took the risks I needed to. I mean, doesn__ really matter. I can only score the most points I can every weekend. So the more points I score, the better it is for both situations. It doesn__ matter. Nothing changes. I don__ have to do anything different for either-or. It__ quite simple: just try and beat both drivers and life__ easy then!",United States,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah. I was a little bit worried when I saw that I was the only car on Softs at the beginning, but I kind of knew that it was a bit of a risky move. I mean, what I had in mind was to use the soft to try and get free air. It was quite optimistic because we had two cars in front, but that__ what we tried to do. We at least gained a position, and that helped us a lot for the rest of the race. So I__ very happy overall because it__ been a tough second part of the year, and to be back on the podium here after what was a difficult FP1 with the gearbox problem, we recovered well, so I__ happy. Yeah. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it. Unfortunately today, I lost out at the end, but I had fun in the car. I__ very happy. I'm very happy because obviously we had the gearbox problem in FP1, which cost us a little bit of laps, which then meant we were a little bit on the back foot, trying to recover in the Sprint Qualifying and Sprint Race. And then in qualifying we did some fine tuning, we found a lot more performance. And today was a really good race for us. So it__ a good thing, especially considering the whole situation. The second part of the season hasn__ been easy. There is completely unfounded noise and rumours around the team. And I think to demonstrate that in those kinds of situations we can stay focused on the job and be rewarded with a podium is a really nice feeling. I knew it was an aggressive strategy. My plan was to be first after the first corner. I didn__ quite make that, but at least I gained a position, which helped me a little bit with free air. And that definitely helped our race. Again, I knew it was aggressive but considering the feeling I had on the Hard in FP1, I was quite convinced I didn__ want to touch that tyre. So yeah, I was just a little bit worried when my engineer got on the radio on the grid and I was the only car on Softs, basically. So I thought, __K, maybe there's something I didn__ feel right._ But in the end, it ended up a good choice. I mean, Lando had four, five laps cooling down the tyres, and then I knew that when he would come back it would be very difficult to keep him behind. I tried because I managed to do so for quite a few laps, but then towards the end the tyres were starting to struggle a bit more. Yeah. But we are in a different situation now. I mean, I still want to believe we can win a race before the end of the season. But again, I think we need to be realistic in our situation and I don't think we quite have the car to do so. I think this weekend has been the perfect weekend for the team and I__l be surprised if we can achieve anything better until the end of the year. But we__l take it race by race and see what can be done. I didn__ really follow much today. But it__ a track that I think we really enjoy _ the way the track is made and how open up the entry of the corners are made it very entertaining and nice, because you__e got different lines. And yeah, this helps action and trying to make overtakes. So, yeah, I really, really enjoyed it. Then for the last few laps I did behind Lando, I was struggling quite a bit with tyres. So I didn__ follow for very long.
LN: I followed for quite long. And, I mean, it__ tricky. Honestly, it__ almost trickier to follow in the slow speed than it is the high-speed corners. Yeah. That__ why on the street circuits, you also never really get overtaken _ because it__ almost harder to follow on them than it is in quicker circuits at the minute. So_ and next year _ completely different. I have no idea. It__ a completely different car. The battery and all that stuff is _ yeah, I don__ even know how it__ going to work next year, to be honest. So, I__ sure it__l be a lot better just because there__ a lot less downforce and a lot less grip.
And the cars won__ look anywhere near as cool going through, like, Sector 1 here, for example, because it__ a lot slower in the corners. But they__l be quick in the straights for a few seconds. So I think the racing will probably be a bit better next year.",United States,post-race,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was good. I think every segment the car was very strong. Just trying to put the lap together around here sometimes can be quite tricky. Also, it's very hot, very strong winds as well. And then in that first sector, having a tailwind is challenging, let__ say it like that. Yeah, the first run in Q3 was good, just managed to improve a little bit from Q2 unfortunately, and I couldn't do my final run. It was a bit messy with the out laps. But luckily, like you said, we didn't need it. So, yeah, for us, again, a very strong result. Yeah, again, just tricky with the wind. The wind picked up today compared to yesterday, and it managed to turn as well, a little bit. So, like a full-on tailwind into all the __sses_, and with that you just lose downforce. So the car is moving around a lot more even compared to yesterday. That made it a bit harder. Of course, in some corners you gain a bit of lap time back, but you can't commit as much as you normally can in Sector 1. Yeah. It was, I think, a good qualifying. I think the conditions weren't easy, with stronger winds today compared to yesterday. So, Sector 1, yeah, it was a bit harder to be consistent because the car was moving around everywhere. But I guess everyone, of course, is in the same boat with that. And then, yeah, just Q1, Q2, just trying to progress every time with the lap time. I didn't feel like in Q3 the track was actually any better _ maybe slightly worse, actually, I think for a lot of people. But, yeah, just trying to find a little bit more pace. And luckily it was there in the car, so just seemed a little step forward compared to yesterday's qualifying. I think it just made you aware that it was quite tricky around there, which was the case throughout the whole qualifying. The car was quite loose in that area, so I can understand what happened there. And, yeah, you just had to deal with that for the rest of qualifying. Yeah. I hope it's better for tomorrow. It's difficult to say right now what will happen, of course, also tomorrow. But at least I felt a bit happier with the car compared to yesterday's qualifying, and I hope that's enough then for the race tomorrow. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I mean, we changed some things on the car and hopefully that will help tomorrow, and that's the most important. But, yeah, we'll find out. I mean, I don't really think about it too much. I'm confident that I think we improved the car and hopefully we can show that. Yeah. There were just some people in front that were just leaving like ten seconds, easily. So, yeah, then you just run out of time. Then I had two cars in front of me. They were racing as well. I think they set purple sectors on the out lap. Yeah. That__ not ideal. So, yeah, we just ran out of time.",United States,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Well, I improved like, I don't know, half a tenth or a tenth. It was a bit more of a struggle today for whatever reason. Yesterday, I was just quite comfortable. And I don't know if it's just everyone else has improved a bit or the wind today hurt us a bit more. But we were both struggling quite a bit more today just to put the laps in and to be as quick as this guy. So we were pushing, and I'm so happy with P2. It could have been worse, but there was no chance we could have gone pole today. Yeah. Yeah, just don't get hit _ that's my clue for tomorrow. But I look forward to hopefully having a good race with Max. You know, we've had some good ones in the past, so I'm looking forward to it again. Too difficult. I mean, comparing to yesterday_ Yesterday, I was pretty happy with everything and things came a bit easier. Today, not so much. And I think that was clear already in Q1, Q2, and Q3. So, yeah, I guess some stuff for us to look into why we probably struggled a bit more compared to yesterday, like Max said. And we know that the wind and temperature and stuff was a little bit different. So, yeah, some things for us to figure out. Not my best lap _ I said that on the radio after. So, yeah, just not a great session. So to be P2 I'm still pretty happy with. Yeah. The boys and girls did a good job to get everything back and prepared. Obviously, never the best preparation for everyone to be rushing to put the car back together, but that was all fine. I think quite a bit, honestly, because we've not done _ I don't think I've done more than three laps in a row and not more than, like, 40 kilos of fuel. So, I have no idea. We don't know if it's going to be amazing or terrible, certainly around here because it's so difficult with the bumps and the bottoming and the winds. It's unpredictable. So, we were hoping to learn a lot this morning in the Sprint, in terms of how the car set-up was going to be from quali to race and how it changes and the things that are good and bad. And then hopefully make tweaks for this quali for the race tomorrow. But obviously that didn__ go to plan. So, yeah, we're certainly on the back foot, but I guess we will try not to use that as an excuse tomorrow. I mean, like all things we do as a team, it'll be reviewed. I think it probably takes a bit more time to understand everything, and certainly just before qualifying and probably before the race tomorrow is not the best time. So, yeah, I think things will be reviewed to just understand a few more things. But apart from that, you know, it's nothing I can do. Like, I just have to crack on and do my own thing. I was pretty unlucky to not have a chance to race earlier. And, yeah, that__ not just hurt me yesterday or today, but also for the race tomorrow in terms of preparation. So, yeah, it was a difficult time. But I said what I said, and I won't add any more. Yeah. I mean, I think before the weekend, I was asked what's going to help me get further up. At the minute, it's just consistency. I think on a day like today, it's just clear we're not as quick as the Red Bull and therefore we have to be happy with the P2 because that's the best we could have done today, you know. So, yeah, similar to like the questions and stuff, it's just not getting distracted by the mess and the nonsense around that everyone creates and just focus on doing my laps, doing my own job, focusing on trying to get good results and a good performance. But certainly with my position tomorrow and knowing our form in race pace compared to quali, we know Saturdays have just never been as good this year. So I__ hoping we can turn it up a little bit tomorrow and be a bit quicker. I have to be optimistic. Silly not to be. But, you know, I think every single lap that we did today was between, what, five tenths to _ three to five tenths off of Max. So to turn that around completely tomorrow, I think it's going to be pretty difficult. I think normally when we have better Sundays, we're quite a bit closer than three to five tenths. And I'm sure if Max did his final lap, he probably would have gone a good step quicker again. So, yeah, not the most hopeful in terms of how our performance was today, but may as well be hopeful anyway. They've been quick in many races recently. You know, the last month, two months,  they've been doing a very good job _ both Max and Red Bull. They've just been doing a good job and have seemed to catch us up a little bit. And, you know, we're not talking a lot _ it's just enough that they're a bit more consistently ahead and on the front row. And when you're on the front row and can have nice races, it can get you a lot of points and give you a lot of opportunities. And then, of course, Max is the one who makes the most of them. So, yeah, I think most places we go now, we think Red Bull will be our biggest competitor, and that's how it's been for the last few months _ and I'd say the whole year. I mean, it's a challenging track. I think Turn 1 is a challenge in itself. You know, it's never easy, but I think there are quite common situations that cause crashes over the last few years, and one of them happened again today. So, yeah, I think you just have to be aware of what happens on different tracks, different Turn 1s. That__ part of our job as drivers. But, I mean, as team-mates and as a team, we don't want these things to happen. We've said that every single time, and it's the truth. So, yeah, like I said, we'll review it and keep going racing.",United States,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I mean, it was quite a big surprise, especially considering the weekend that has been very difficult for us since the beginning. We tried and put everything together in qualifying. We managed to do so, but I think there are still things we need to understand from this car because there's a bit too much of a swing of performance in the same weekend without fundamentally changing the car. So we'll look into it. But it's been an interesting Sprint race this morning. I think we've learned a lot. We applied that in qualifying and it seems to be working. So I hope that from now on we kind of catch back a little bit. Yeah. Our car is normally stronger in the race than it is in qualifying. So that__ a positive. I don't know if it's strong enough to go and fight with Max and McLaren, but we'll do everything. Hopefully a good start like this morning or last year and then focus to stay in front. Well, we've changed a few things, but it's not like there's been something that we've done a massive change with. It was all about fine tuning. There's something more specific that I've changed on my side, which I think went towards my driving style a little bit and maybe that helped. But a swing of performance like from yesterday to today is still to be understood, to be completely honest. There was more wind. We know that with our car, this is normally a strong point, which probably helped us today. But again, it's a big swing of performance, so we still need to understand. Not that different. It's just that the overall performance is very poor. So actually, it's pretty similar to last year in terms of qualifying pace to race pace. We seem to be pretty strong in race pace, but in qualifying pace, we don't quite find the grip that the others have. Especially in the first sector, we tend to struggle a lot with the grip there and that costs a lot of lap time for the rest of the lap. So, yeah, pretty similar, just slower. I don't know. A good start like last year probably will help with the free air, but I don't think that we quite have that pace in the car. But never say never. I think last year, we were very surprised once we got into free air to see the amount of pace there was in the car. I hope we can have the same surprise tomorrow, but for now, it seems unlikely.",United States,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. I mean, the start was good. Then, of course, there was a Safety Car because of the Turn 1 incident. Then it took a few laps after the Safety Car to have decent pace, so we need to figure out what was going on there. But nevertheless, we won the Sprint, which is, of course, the most important. But, of course, already looking ahead to tomorrow. I do think we need to be a bit better in race trim to be able to fight the McLarens, because we haven__ seen anything of them. Kind of, yes. Well, we__l have a look. Of course, we have some ideas what we can do, and then hopefully, we__l just stick a bit better tomorrow. It was OK. I mean, the start was good, but then I think the overall pace throughout the race, I expected it to be a little bit better. So that's something we need to work on, especially if the McLarens are not out on lap one tomorrow. I do think that if they would have raced today, it would have been very tough to keep them behind. So that is something that, yeah, for tomorrow, we need to work on. But nevertheless, I take it. We__l take the points. It's positive. And now we just need to look ahead, you know, how we can improve a little bit the pace. No. It's not about believing in it. I just take it race by race. I just try to do the best I can. Today, yeah, perfect for me to get those points, brings me a bit closer for sure, which I think is nice for everyone. Maybe not for them, but in general for everyone. But, yeah, I look into different things. I was not entirely happy with the pace in the race, and I know if we want to win tomorrow, we need to be better. And that's what I'll just focus on. Just a bit more grip, better feeling on the balance of the car. Over one lap it felt OK, but in the race I felt like we were probably degging a bit too much. Like I said, we didn't have a proper reference against the McLarens, but for sure, they would have been faster than I was now in the Sprint. So, yeah, just thinking ahead. We'll see, won't we? I don't know. We'll see race by race what happens. I can't look into the future, unfortunately. With some things that would be nice. Yeah, we'll first see what we can do in qualifying. I don't know. From my side, I was just not entirely happy with the pace, so that's what I need to work on. And then we'll automatically see tomorrow, of course, if that's going to be enough or not. We're not lost, but we just need to look into some details in the car to see if we can make it a bit better for the race especially. Yeah, the start was good. I looked in my mirror and I could see immediately that I didn__ really need to defend. So it was more about driving a bit in the middle because Turn 1 is very wide. I just tried to do my normal line, normal corner. Then, of course, I looked again in the mirror, and suddenly there were some cars turned around. It's that type of corner in the start__ou can gain a lot of positions if you do it well, but at the same time, it's a risky corner to try and get positions.
But it seems like the tarmac is a bit more consistent left to right. Singapore was very tough if you started on the inside. I think with that tarmac that has been laid two years ago, that helps a bit to make it a bit more fair between left and right.",United States,post-sprint,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah. I mean, I knew you don__ get many opportunities with Max. I saw half a chance and sent it. I was probably too far behind, but glad I gave it a go. P2 for sure was better than we could have expected. And, yeah, some decent points. I mean, I was on the outside, and I fully sent it. And then I realised everyone on the inside fully sent it as well. Carlos and I were like, I don__ think that__ going to end too nicely. I__e not seen it _ I only saw it from my perspective _ but it looked like it was sort of three cars into one, which doesn__ often go. Yeah, obviously I just stayed out of trouble at Turn 1 and, yeah, fought hard in those first laps after the Safety Car to try and get past Max. Obviously I had half a chance. I knew that would probably be my last chance, so yeah, sent it. Obviously I just couldn__ quite make the corner. But, yeah, P2. I think similar to what Max said, it was decent, it was okay. But if the McLarens were there, I think they'd have probably been ahead of us. I knew Max__ell, I saw Max was struggling a little bit, and I was just giving absolutely everything. And I knew that I would probably deg a little bit more, whereas when you're in the lead, you're probably trying to manage the tyres a bit better. He had a bit of a snap out of the previous corner, so I just thought, you know what, this is my only chance. There was a nice headwind in that corner, so I thought I could make it stick. But I was too far back. I'm glad I tried it as opposed to just sitting there and still finishing in the same place.",United States,post-sprint,Mercedes
Carlos Sainz,"Oh. We didn__ put one of the best of starts, but then we took the outside line into Turn 1, which was definitely_ Yeah, we definitely had a solid race. We had solid pace from there on. The Ferraris were quick behind, but I kept them under control and we brought home the P3, which tastes really good. Nothing. We__e just getting a little bit more lucky, and things stopped happening to us. But I__e had this pace all year. It__ just for the first half of the year I wasn__ able to show it and to prove it. But now that things are running a lot smoother, I__ just doing everything that I was doing in the first half. It__ just things are clicking. And, yeah, just happy to show what we can do as a team, what I can do. The car was great yesterday in quali and today in the race. We lack a bit compared to these guys _ obviously we cannot fight them _ but we__e still in the mix. So it__ good to see. Okay. Yep. Good race, honestly. Surprised that we could hold the Ferraris behind, especially because at some point, they were super quick, catching on me. But then once I got__ think Lewis was 1.2, 1.4 seconds__nd he stopped making the progress, and I could keep them at a comfortable margin. We need to improve a bit the race pace, especially low speed feels like we have a bit of margin to improve, hopefully for tomorrow. But the car has been giving me confidence all weekend, and hopefully we can keep building on it because it's been a very solid weekend, given the fact that we missed practice, and we still managed to put it P7 on the grid and podium today. Yeah. I had a pretty average, pretty poor start. I got distracted with one thing and I couldn't get off the line well, which forced me to take the outside line into Turn 1. A bit like George, I braked really late on the outside because you have all the clean air and the headwind to brake as late as you want. But then I realised, looking left, that the guys on the inside had braked as late as the guys that were almost already outbraking ourselves on the outside. So, yeah, I kind of thought there was going to be contact there because people braked really late on the inside, and there were a lot of cars on the inside. I just took basically evasive action going all the way around the outside. I thought at some point I was going to go in the gravel with how much I had to avoid the accident. And then suddenly, I found myself in P3.",United States,post-sprint,Williams
Oliver Bearman,"Yeah. I think it's been a bit up and down. But since the summer break, I've found a good level of consistency, and I've also changed the way I've been approaching things a little bit and found a bit more consistent performance in that. Also within the team, some things are changing as well, so I'm in a really good place at the moment. I'm really happy with how things are going. That's nice. What I was aiming for at the start of the season was to see a big improvement in myself and my level of driving and capabilities and I've seen that. So that's good. I needed a few more so I could overtake him as well. I don't know, but I think it will be fun to watch. But, yeah, I think it's cool what Max is doing at the moment _ getting back some points. I hope it goes down to the wire for all three of them and may the best win. Yeah. I don't think it's ideal. It__ that age-old thing: I think if a footballer or another sportsman had a mic on and was able to broadcast, the views would be very different. It's tough. We cannot open the microphone and say it in our head, but with the amount of adrenaline and pressure we're under in this sport, when you open the radio and want to share your frustration or feelings with your engineer, you're not thinking about the other people, the whole population of the world that could potentially hear it. So it's a shame that it's broadcasted, and for me, it should be cracked down a little bit. Yeah, that's my view.",United States,thursday,Haas
Fernando Alonso,"I don't know. I mean, it's difficult to always measure your performance, as we have ups and downs, as everybody does, depending on the circuit and the characteristics_ the weekend, the layout, the car performs a little bit better or worse. It seems that you are performing better or worse because of the car. But, yeah. I mean, it will not be a season to be remembered. Let's see. I think we had some challenges in the last two years here. Even in 2023, when the car was performing well, we struggled here. So yeah, we need to do something different than the last two events here to really score points. At the same time, we come from Singapore being on the fast pace there. So, it's a Sprint weekend, which I think normally is an advantage for us _ knowing the circuit and having the first qualifying already the second time we go in the car on Friday night. So, yeah, I'm ready to take an opportunity if it comes. Yes. I think the level of complexity of the set-up will not be understood. So, yeah, I don't think we need to explain it here. No. I mean, I was happy with the penalty. I gained the position. So even one second was enough. Not needed, the extra four. Difficult to guess. I mean, that will be the question that we all want to know in advance. I would say that the two McLarens have a little bit of an advantage, just because of the points advantage. So, yeah, I would say it's between the two of them. But, yeah, Max is an incredible driver, and if there is anyone that can overcome the deficit of the car, it's him. So, yeah, let's see. Yeah. It does a little bit. You approach the weekend taking care of every single detail. It's not that you don't do that at the beginning of the year, but you understand that it's a long championship and you can afford some ups and downs. Now there is no room for mistakes anymore if you are chasing the leaders. So, yeah, there is a little bit of pressure on that. On the same way, if you are leading the championship, even if you have a little bit of margin, you don't want to lose that point advantage. So there is a different atmosphere for sure on the weekends, but it's a lovely place to be. No. Yeah. I agree with both of them. Unnecessary sometimes, poorly broadcasted and chosen by the one choosing which radios to broadcast. Misunderstood 99.9% of the time because they are private conversations with your engineer or your team that maybe you went through on Sunday morning in the strategy meeting. You know? ""What happens if we come out of the pit stop in this scenario?"" or ""What happens if on lap one we overtake two cars or we miss two positions?"" So you have alternative plans on the strategy that, obviously, when you only broadcast one sentence, it's impossible to understand at home and the repercussion that it has. But, yeah, sometimes when the radio broadcast is the protagonist of the race, that also is very sad, that the race was so poor in terms of entertainment. So, yeah, that's something we need to improve all as a group in the sport. I think on the weekends we still need to perform at our best level. We need to keep the motivation high. We need to improve in some things that we need, operational-wise, to get better for next year. So we need to use these six races as a test in a way. And, yeah, obviously we need to have an eye on next year__ calendar and save a little bit of energy. Even if we are racing hard and we__e travelling for these next two months, we need to also think about having some rest as well now in the last part of the year, to start in January with the batteries fully charged. Well, I think he's a four-time world champion, first of all. That__ not a casual thing. He__ one of the best drivers in the history of the sport. I think he__ able to extract the maximum from the car. When the car is a dominant car, he can win the championship and break some records along the season. And when the car is not that good or not the fastest, he still provides the good lap in qualifying, or the good race, the good fight. He__ at a very good level, very high level. And, yeah, this year he's obviously fighting against a superior car, which is the McLaren. But, yeah, if it comes to the last race or whatever and they are tight on points, maybe in that moment he becomes the man to follow. As I said before, I think the two McLarens have enough advantage on the car to fight between them. But, yeah, with Max, that can happen, as we saw in 2021 when the car was a little bit less performing than the Mercedes. He still won the championship in Abu Dhabi. I prefer to be leading the championship. If I'm leading the championship with the best car, I will not lose it. No. I don__ think so. If you are not leading the championship by now, it__ because you didn__ have the best car. So you need to wait for something unexpected, or a small miracle, because you've been chasing the leader with not the best car by race 18 _ or whatever it is now. So in the remaining six races, there is hope, but you need to have some help from the leaders. Well, I think you need to perform at your best in the remaining races. You depend a little bit on yourself. If Lando wins the six races, he will be champion. And probably the DNF in Zandvoort was very costly. That can happen to either of the two in the remaining races. That__ something you also need to take into account _ in some of the starts, in some of the crucial moments of the race _ the battles that you need to choose, which ones to fight hard and so on. Because maybe Oscar can afford a DNF and still be in contention. Lando, a little bit less, because of the Zandvoort DNF. So it's a bit of a luck factor as well that__ on the table now for both of them. Hopefully we see a very exciting end of the season between Lando and Oscar.",United States,thursday,Aston Martin
Franco Colapinto,"Yeah. It's been better. I found just a bit more consistency in the car. It's been tricky to drive for me _ just really struggling to find the consistency of the car, I think, from track to track, session to session, it was starting to be really unpredictable. I think I'm just starting to find my feet in the last few races after the summer break. Just before, I could start to feel that the pace was improving. I think we are working really well with my engineers. We also know that the car _ we need to find more pace out of the package that we've got. It's not at the moment where want or where we expect to be at this point of the year. So we are trying to work hard, trying to understand our issues, trying to come to the races that we know are a bit more beneficial for our car _ trying to be spot on with the set-up and trying to be ready from P1, where we think is best. But, yeah, we are struggling to kind of bring that pace from track to track. On my side, of course, learning and understanding the car better session after session. But, yeah, it's been tough. Clearly an improvement though. That__ why the races have been positive on the personal side. But, of course, not happy with the results as a team at the moment. Nothing, just I think keep doing what I'm doing. I'm working very well with the team, so very happy about that. And I think especially looking at these last five rounds, we really struggled for pace and to see that we are not giving up. Everyone in the team is staying motivated _ the engineers, the mechanics _ they keep pushing us as if we were scoring points, but we are not at the moment. But it's good to see the motivation that they all have to keep pushing, keep finding more performance out of the car. And I think it's something that we are all doing, and something that, when the car is good next year, it will be very important to have. So I think it's a good preparation for when our moment comes. The moment is not there yet, but I trust that the car next year will be quick. I need more than a few. I don't know. I guess it's between the three of them. No. Not from me. Yeah. It's tricky. It's tricky to measure as well sometimes what we say. I think it's a sport that has very different things compared to other sports. Two minutes before we jump in the car, we are with fans, with people. We are not fully focused on what we have to do. Any other sportsmen _ tennis, football _ they are fully focused before, they don't see anyone, they are with their team, and they are just focused on what they have to do next. We have many external things we have to deal with. The radio is one of them, and to get the chance for it to be open for all the world and everyone being able to listen to what we say _ it's sometimes tough. We never think about it being broadcast to the whole world. It's tricky, but I think we have to measure some of what we say a bit too much. Should we also measure what the TV puts out or not? Sometimes it will sound a bit too wild, what we say. So, yeah. Yeah. I think all the America races _ starting from this one _ are very special. I've been waiting for these three races all year: Austin, Mexico, and Brazil. They are the races that I__ closer to home, and they feel very warm, you know, with the amount of people, all the fans coming from Argentina. Also, my family living very close _ some coming to these races. And especially last year, this race was also very good. Personally, I scored points, got into Q3 for the Sprint, so it was quite a good weekend. I love driving here as well. Austin is a track I really enjoy driving. It was one of my favorites last year. And, yeah, I think especially for the fans and for how close I am to home, these rounds in America are the ones I weigh the most in the season. No. IndyCar is a championship I love watching. I don't think I__l be racing here [in the US] in the close future, but yeah, it's a thing for in a few years, when I'm older, I would love to try IndyCar. I don't know. I haven__ been speaking to anyone.",United States,thursday,Alpine
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon, everyone. I was at the factory and then headed out here, had some work in LA, and then I came here. Yesterday, I rode a horse for the first time, so it was an unbelievable experience. When I was younger, there used to be a horse in a field nearby__ust a shire horse. It was this beautiful horse. It was always on its own every day, so I'd go and stop, and it would come over to me, and I'd spend time with it. But then I'd start walking home and notice my allergies start kicking off, and I'd struggle to breathe. I__ really struggle, and I didn__ know I had asthma. It wasn__ until I was around another horse another time and had an asthma attack__t was a really scary experience because I didn__ have an inhaler or anything. So, I stayed away from horses since that day, when I was probably 14 or something. I went through a desensitisation program because my allergies were crazy, particularly for hay fever in the UK, were crazy. I hadn__ thought about it much since. Then I did a shoot at the beginning of this year with a horse for the Time 100 magazine. I took medication, antihistamines, and I was able to be around the horse__o problems. So yesterday, I did the shoot with a horse for Plus 44, and I was like, __an I ride it?_ I got on, and it was just_ wow. It was an amazing experience. Then the horse started moving, started to gallop, and I was like __od!_  I didn__ know what to do. So I panicked a little bit, but it was beautiful. I__ really excited about this next kind of phase of my life, where I__ going to be around horses more and really get into riding. That__ my next thing. Expectations__aturally, I never have expectations except that we give it our all and we continue to improve. There are lots of positives to take from every weekend, and lots of areas we can improve on. We spent time after the last race going through areas we can improve on, and I really think this weekend we can take a step forward in extracting more from the car that we have. We've not moved the car forwards in terms of performance, but there is more performance in the car. If we execute a little better, I think we can extract more. So that__ the goal. I don__ know where the rumours have come from, so I can__ really shed much light on that. It__ a little distracting for us as a team. The team have made it clear where they stand in terms of re-signing Fred. Fred, I, and the whole team are working really hard on the future. These things aren__ helpful. Everyone back in the factory is working incredibly hard, focused, and these sorts of rumours can sometimes be distracting. So for me, it__ about keeping the focus on the goal in front of us and building on next year__ car__ontinuing to build a foundation so we can have better execution and better performance next year. As I said back in Spa__ust having lots of meetings, making sure we__e sailing in the right direction. Yeah. I__ really looking at the next six races as, ultimately, test weekends in terms of continuing to learn and improve on our processes. As I said in the last races, there__ been a couple of gems through the weekend that we didn__ capitalise on. So it__ about taking those good bits and continuing to take what works and change what doesn__. That__ what we__e trying to do moving forward__ontinuing to build on the relationships, continue to build on communication. Everyone back at the factory really deserves a good result, and that__ the sole focus__o get good results, try to maximise, squeeze absolutely every point we can out of our performances on the weekends. And I really believe we can do that. So we just stay focused. I don__, and I__ not going to entertain rumours. Yeah, the last few laps were definitely nerve-wracking. I__e finished races before with three tyres, and now I__e finished one with three brakes. Not something I want to experience again. I could stop the car, but in those scenarios, the pedal just went straight to the floor. So I had no choice but to go onto those exit roads__ wouldn__ have made the corner otherwise. The FIA penalty was fine. Doesn__ really make a big difference to me anyway. I don__ believe it! No, I haven__ seen Fernando__ haven__ seen him since then. But yeah, it was just a bit of fun. It reminded me of that show__ hadn__ seen it in 20-plus years. I thought it was funny, so I posted it. What is life if you can__ have a little fun? Yeah. For me, I think best memories would be sitting watching F1 together when I was like five. Along the journey would be, you know, the extra jobs that he had__utting __or sale_ signs up. I__ go around and help him put these ""for sale"" signs up when I was younger. Sitting, watching him work on my go-kart when he came home from work. And the moment that I would start the race in the early days in go-karts, we had a handshake. And knowing that I had him by my side, I knew that I would be safe when I came back from being on track. And then, along the way, seeing him at the bottom of the podium when I won my first race in F1__ust knowing all the background of all the hard work and real sacrifice and blood, sweat, and tears that our family put into it. I think that was the real highlight at the end. I think it__ been amazing to see the growth and the interest from people here in the States. And I think this track is, for me, the best track here in the States. It__ one of my favourite tracks on the whole calendar. But I love that we__e been able to tap into the sporting community here. I know you have a big college football team here, and they__e massively passionate about sports. So it__ great that we were able to kind of tap into that finally. I think the first time we came here, it was all kind of like, __1? What is F1?_ But the progress__he journey that we__e been on__rom Netflix being out, to then the biggest sports movie of all time, the F1 movie that we did this year, has been amazing. And not only that__ringing people from all ages to the race. There__ a huge turnout every time we come here, and this is one of my favourite weekends of the year because you get to head into town, get some great food, and it__ just a really great atmosphere. So I__ really thankful to the people of Austin and to Bobby for hosting us every time. The circuit__ improving every time we come. Still a little bit bumpy, but I think that__ because the underground is moving a little bit. They__e just added a theme park, so it__ becoming a really incredible event.",United States,thursday,Ferrari
Max Verstappen,"We'll try, yeah, for sure. The last three weekends have been very nice__ome better than others. I still think in Singapore we didn't maximise the potential of the car, but again, you analyse everything and try to do better. That__ what we__l try to do again here. It__ a great track to drive. Sprint weekend__lways a bit hectic__ut I__ curious to see what we can do. Fifty-fifty. You either win it or you don__. Not sure. This car is a bit different to the previous one, so it__ not a guarantee that it works everywhere. I prefer to just look at it race by race. We__l try to do our best here and then move on and see what we get. Wait__ would arrive in Tokyo? I said that, really? Okay. I like Tokyo. It__ a good place. I know I was joking. I don__ know__t__ impossible to know. I think it__ not really worth going into that too much. The car is just a bit more balanced now. It doesn__ oversteer dramatically or understeer dramatically. But every weekend, you__e fine-tuning things because it__ never perfect. Luckily, lately, the car, it__ been a bit more together. And then at the same time, it__ not about believing in the championship or not__ou just need to be realistic. We__e had some good results lately, and I know when the car is capable of being quick and fighting for top places, I can be there. It__ as simple as that. I don__ really think about it too much__imple as that. I come to the race weekend, try to do everything I can in the car. It doesn__ matter if I__ behind or in front. Naturally, of course, it__ nicer to be in front because it means you__e leading the championship. But I see every race weekend as an opportunity to try and win. If we don__, we don__. Life goes on__t__ not dramatic. It doesn__ put any pressure. I guess it helps that I__e already won. As a team, we__e still trying to understand the car a bit more, learn more for next year as well. It__ not like you completely start over next year. Yeah, but at the end of the day, it__ a whole team effort. I enjoy working with everyone__t__ a good atmosphere. We're on a good way, right? We__e had some nice results, and I think that helps everyone. Confidence is high, and that makes it really nice to come to a race weekend. It seems like we__e understanding much more what the car can do and how it needs to be driven. I think, in general, they are still quite strong in the medium-speed corners. That__ definitely a strength of their car. The rest depends a bit on the track layout and conditions__t__ a bit difficult to say. But medium-speed corners, probably still where they__e very good. For me, what is the most impressive is how he was as a racing driver. Naturally, I think with a bit more luck, he would have had a much better career in Formula 1. But the most impressive thing is just his knowledge of racing, tuning, setting up cars, go-karts. What he taught me from a very young age__hat kind of knowledge__ou can't really describe it. It definitely made me the person I am today, but also not only just driving fast in a car, it__ just, again, the knowledge of the car. He would be, I think, a really, really good team boss, even though I don__ think he wants to be, but he would definitely be a very good team boss or a leader in a team. His technical understanding of the car, the parts on the car, and how you can make things go faster. I still discuss so many things with him__bout these things for him in his rally car, for me in the F1 car as well, and at the same time also for my GT3 team, what we can do. So yeah, it is very impressive to have someone like that__s my dad__xplaining it all and giving you all that knowledge. That, for me, is the most impressive. And at the same time, the years that he sacrificed when I started racing all the way to Formula 1, basically kind of pausing his career in whatever he wanted to do or could do outside of Formula 1, and basically giving 100__o, I would say 110%__ecause I__e never seen someone that committed to giving the best opportunities to his son. Not only in providing the best material but actually tuning the material himself. Yeah. I don__ need to know. It__ all okay. I think at the end of the day it has to do with family as well. You know, doing so many races if you had to be a team boss... First of all, I__ very happy with the team boss that I have. But he definitely could be a good one on any level, from go-karting all the way to the top. But it__ fine. Like I said, we discuss a lot of things, and he__ there in the background. He advises me. He helps me with certain things if I need to figure stuff out__or F1 or GTs. And that__ just super helpful to have. He has so many contacts as well around the world. I think it__ just super cool. We__e both just super passionate about racing in any kind of form. Probably if I would go in a rally car. But besides that, no. We just discuss things. It__ not like he tells me where to brake or where to turn in. But we still talk about everything throughout a race weekend and what I do with the car or not. Absolutely! Someone_ I don__ know, I heard something... Does it help me? I don__ know. I mean, I honestly don__ know. I don__ care also, because it has nothing to do with me__hat they decide, of course, within the team__ow they operate as a team. I mean, they do whatever they think is right, and they__e doing a very good job at it__eing this quick and what they__e done over the last few years. For me, what__ important is that when we get to the racetrack, we just maximise our potential. And as long as we can do that, then it__ in our control. Of course, if you look at the whole season, we didn__ have a great start to it. But I just approach every race weekend trying to maximize everything we can, try to win races, and that__ the only thing we can do until the end.",United States,thursday,Red Bull
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Well, thank you. Yeah, it__ my first time here. I went for a track walk this morning just to have a look. It looks very fun and enjoyable, especially Sector one__ull of high speed. It__ a very bumpy track, so let__ see how our car behaves. We know that__ not normally the best for us, but we__e been trying different things recently, and hopefully it can be a good weekend. I think the races where we were in the points, we had very good laps that put us in Q3 and in a good starting position, and then we maintained more or less where we were. In Singapore, I think I was a little unlucky with the yellow flag there and I was out in Q1, but I think the car had good potential to maybe put it in Q3 with a very good lap. When you start at the back, it__ tough to overtake. Maybe I could have kept it in there. It was a tough weekend. We didn__ have much race pace. Other teams have also stepped up__ot only us doing a good job. A lot of teams are still bringing developments to the car. It__ a bit more difficult than a few races ago, but I still think we__e on it to score points in this last stretch of the season. Thank you for the birthday wishes. For me, sim is an important thing. I__e always done it. Preparing for these events__ew track, very technical__ spent a lot of hours with the team and at home on my new sim. I don__ know exactly how many hours, but it was a lot. A lot of laps__aybe more than I wanted to__ut it was enough. I feel prepared, I__e done my homework, and now it__ about hitting the track tomorrow, getting used to it in only one FP session, and going for the Sprint Quali. Yes. I mean, I don__ know for sure, but whatever happens, happens. You need to be ready. I think everyone needs to think the same in Formula 1. If you don__ think like that, I don__ know why you__e here. That season was very long for both of them. It was actually enjoyable to watch from the outside when I was watching it__ery tense. Hopefully, at some point, I can get a season like that: very competitive and enjoyable right into the last race of the year. I think my championships in F3 and F2. My father unfortunately was working a lot, he has not been at so many races during my career but in the main ones, fighting for the titles, the first person I went to hug after my title was him. It was such a special moment with him. These two years, _23 and _24, were very special for me to see him when I was standing in the car celebrating and to walk straight to him was very special. And when I was younger, obviously, when he brought me to the track for the first time.",United States,thursday,Sauber
George Russell,"Yeah. It feels amazing, especially after what happened a couple of years ago. That was a bit of a missed opportunity, but we more than made up for it today. Just so grateful for the team. They did an amazing job this whole weekend. We don't really know where this performance came from, but really happy. Yeah. I mean, Friday was a really tough day for me for many different reasons, and I wasn't feeling comfortable. But by the time I went to Q3, I felt great in the car, and that's when it matters. Obviously, I was a bit nervous at the beginning when I saw Max on the Soft, but that first stint was great from us and we just extended the gap. I mean, I said it yesterday. If I were to make a list of all the races I thought we could win at this year, this would probably be right at the bottom. So I think we need to sit down tomorrow and Tuesday to sort of understand why the performance was so good. I hope we can carry this through to the rest of the season, but I think realistically, Lando looked incredibly fast. He was within a second of Max the whole race. And around this circuit, that's not easy. So, we'll take the performance for today, celebrate it, and I won__ think too much about Austin yet. I mean, a one hour, 45-minute race here in Singapore, with the heat and humidity, is never smooth and straightforward. But when I saw Max on the Soft tyres, I knew I just needed to stay ahead of him at Turn 1. But then the opening laps were really strong, and I know Max was probably managing those Softs more than I was managing my Mediums, but pulling the 10-second gap in 20-something laps was really great. And from that moment on, I just knew it was, yeah, bring it home and watch out for the wall at Turn 10. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this track has not been my best friend over the years, and that's often been through my own doing. But as I said, yes, I'm a very different driver today to the one I was a couple of years ago, and I feel more complete, more confident. I know exactly what I need to do in given circumstances. Of course, I was nervous before the race as you'd expect, but I didn't feel any additional nerves or any additional pressure. It just felt like another race, and I knew I had a chance to win, and I felt comfortable with that. So, you know, I've said it for a while _ I feel ready to fight for a championship. I feel ready to take it to my next step. Yeah, well, I thought it was a smart move from those guys because if Max jumped me at Turn 1, to be honest, I think he would have won the race, because overtaking was so challenging. You saw Lando was definitely the quickest guy out there, and he just couldn__ pass Max. He was within a second every single lap. So if Lando couldn__ get past, I doubt we would have been able to achieve it. So, it was crucial that we nailed the start. It__ been a strong point of mine this year, so I__ glad we did. I think there__ been less tyre overheating this year compared to years gone by. I think it__ a track that in the past had major overheating, but with some of the corners having new tarmac, it__ a bit smoother. The tyres seem a little bit more robust this year. It was all just in a bit of a nicer window, but nevertheless, it was still quite a surprise. I think it comes with experience, just knowing how to maximise every situation. Probably a couple of years ago I was driving a bit more tense and probably over-pushing in circumstances when I shouldn__ have been. Now I just feel much more relaxed. Going into today, I was relaxed. When it was raining an hour before the race, I just said, you know, it is what it is. It__ the same for everybody. There__ nothing I can do, so there__ no point stressing about it. I think myself a few years ago would have been slightly different (Audio drops out).",Singapore,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, the track only just got dry [before the start], and starting on the dirty side of the grid... Yeah, well, we just opted to try something different because normally, if you just cross or pass Turn 1, you just stay there without anything crazy. So we tried. It didn't really work out. So, then the first stint was always about just surviving on the tyres, trying to make it long enough to then pit for the Hard tyre. I think that worked out, but unfortunately, I think the whole race was quite difficult _ more difficult than I hoped _ for a lot of different reasons, let__ say it like that. So a few things we need to understand, why these things went wrong today. But even then, around here, even if you have more pace, you can't pass without anything crazy happening. So I think, for us,  second was the maximum result. Yeah, I think so too. It__ just super hard to pass around here, but I didn__ take the lead at Turn 1. So, yeah, we knew that the inside just was a lot worse for start performance. For whatever reason, it took a step back even compared to last year, so it__ a bit of a shame, of course. I knew already yesterday that it would be very tough to even keep the position on the same tyres. Then, of course, with the rain as well, we opted to go for the Soft, just hoping that first of all we could keep our position and maybe have a shot at fighting for P1 into Turn 1. But once I didn__ achieve that, it was a proper management race, trying to keep those Soft tyres alive long enough to bring it to an acceptable lap to stop. Then, of course, I knew that even on a Hard tyre, it was still a long way to go. I think my tyres were six, seven laps older than George__ and Lando__ more or less. So, yeah, it was not easy out there. Plus the whole race, I was struggling a lot with the shifting _ downshifting and upshifting _ so that was not helping. And the balance probably was not where I wanted it to be. So, yeah, I think second was just the maximum that we could do today. But at the same time, even if the balance would have been miles better, second was still the best we could have done if we stayed P2 into Turn 1. That__ just how it goes around here. When nothing crazy happens with a Safety Car or an opportunity, then that is just your position. I think over the last few races we__e definitely improved a lot. A few things that we have done throughout the weekend, that__ what we have to probably look at again for the coming races. But it__ nothing shocking or that we are lost about why maybe some pace has disappeared compared to what we would have liked. It__ just some stuff that we need to analyse, and hopefully next weekend we can do a little bit better. Yeah, well, I think Laurent is probably being too nice in that sense. But at the end of the day, what is very good is that we just approach it as a proper team effort. We always tried to look into the details. We tried to understand what our weaknesses were. And since a few races, it__ definitely picked up a lot. Maybe now it was not as good as last race weekend, but sometimes you come out of a race just a bit lost, not really understanding why or how. I do think that now we understand why or how we can be better. And, yeah, by asking the right questions, including Laurent being involved in that, it__ just working well. Yeah, the 35 is quite a lot already. Ideally, I would have won today. But, yeah, we will try for sure. It__ going to be a proper battle. It__ not so easy when Mercedes wins today and you__e P2, and I think the other Mercedes also scored points _ I don__ know what position. So it__ tough, but we__e going to give it a good go.",Singapore,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah. Not too bad. Not too bad. I could go again. I mean, it was a tough race. Max didn__ make any mistakes, whether I was feeling good or not. I gave it my all today and got close. A few chances where we were side by side and some good little bits of battling. But, yeah, like they said, just too difficult to overtake, which is a shame because the pace was very strong today, and I would have loved to have tried to catch George and given him a little bit more pressure. So, I'm happy with today. I got forward two positions. We won, as a team, the Constructors_ once again, so I'm most happy about that. Yeah. I mean, it was slippery, you know. It was still wet in a lot of places, but it's racing. I put it on the inside. I had a small correction, but nothing more than that _ it was good racing. And like I said, I wish I could have given it a little bit more. I wish there were a few more overtaking opportunities today, but I felt like I did everything I could today. And yep, I'm happy with that. Probably, but probably just a little too late in the weekend to say that. I think more just the race pace was strong, like it always is, and we just weren__ good enough yesterday. I think we still need to understand_ I think we understand why, but if we were to re-run qualifying now, what would we really do different? I don__ think we have maybe the best or clearest picture, and that__ the only reason we couldn__ win today. But the pace was, I think, also the best out there. It didn__ matter _ I couldn__ get past Max. He didn__ make any mistakes and it__ too difficult to follow here. So a bit of a shame, but I did what I could. And even though I was feeling good with the car, and I felt like if I could get past Max, I__ be able to try and have a crack at catching George, and I think I would. It__ just too difficult to follow and too difficult to overtake. No idea. But not much. No. I didn__ even know at the time. I can__ remember it, to be honest. I think the start was good. Just the right-hand side of the grid was good. I think it was a good launch as well, so I got across and put myself in a good position to not get checked up out of Turn 1 and into Turn 2. Just had a big up on the inside of Oscar. It was very close, you know, so slippery because it was still damp in places and drying out. I think I just clipped the back of Max__ car, and that just gave me a little correction, but then that was it. So yeah, good in terms of getting two positions. If I didn__ get them there, I probably never would have got them, just because, like we saw, it was too difficult to overtake. So the aggression there and the forward thinking paid off. Well, I hit Max, so it wasn__ aggressive on my teammate. Yep. I mean, another one is just a great thing. Another Constructors_ feels the same as the first because to get the first was quite an achievement if you still look at where we were just three years ago. We__e overtaken every team in terms of development. We__e outdone them by a long way in terms of development. And in a time when it__ almost harder to do than ever _ with more restrictions, less wind tunnel time, all of those different things, budget cap _ that__ probably been more in our favour over the last five years compared to the budget that the other teams could run at. But, yeah, in a time when it should be more difficult than ever to dominate, that__ exactly what the team has done and given us, by a long way, the best car on the grid. That__ always a very nice thing to say. Every driver that gets to say that, it always puts a smile on your face. But we__e also done very well as a team in terms of drivers, between Oscar and myself pushing each other and delivering every single weekend. You don__ see that in any other team. I think we__e also very proud of that as drivers. But for me, I__e been with McLaren since I started. It was a very different time and place then to where we are now. So that journey makes it more special _ to know the downs, because that__ a lot of what it was back then _ to see the rise we__e had, to see the teamwork, the changes, the atmosphere difference, and the leadership from Zak and Andrea especially, has turned things around and made us the best team in the world. That__ something not many people ever get to say. I__e still not even seen it. I still need to go in and see it. I might look at it and think there__ something else I could have done or done better. Anyone on the grid would have done exactly the same thing as I did. So I think if you fault me for just going on the inside and putting my car on the inside of a big gap, then, yeah, I think you shouldn__ be in Formula 1. So, you know, I don__ think there was anything wrong that I did. Of course, I misjudged a little bit how close I was to Max, but that__ racing. Nothing happened otherwise, and I__ sure I still would have ended up ahead of Oscar anyway because I was on the inside and he would have had the dirty side of the track on the outside. So, I need to go review it, of course. I need to look at things and see if there was something I could have done better. The last thing I want is to make contact with my teammate, especially because all I get is questions from you guys. So, you know, I__ the one that can__ afford anything compared to him. I would put myself at risk just as much if that kind of thing happens. So, yeah, I__l see what I can do with it next time. But the FIA obviously thought it was fine, and the team did too. So, that__ it. I mean, it__l just remain the same, which is open to race. So, yeah, nothing will change because we__e free to race and have been the whole season.",Singapore,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, thanks so much. Amazing to be on pole position. Yesterday was a very challenging day for many different reasons, but it's good to come back and get a good result today. Of course, there__ a long, sweaty race tomorrow, but I knew there was potential in the car. Kimi was doing an amazing job all weekend, and I actually gained quite a lot from seeing what he was capable of doing yesterday afternoon. So yeah, very happy to be on pole. Yeah, it was great. Yeah. I mean, Singapore has not been the kindest to me in the past, and that's been through my own doing the majority of the time. So I'm not going to get carried away with this pole position. Of course, it's the best place to start. There's a good pole-side advantage here, so I'd like to think I can hold the lead into Turn 1, but obviously, this guy on my left is pretty good at race starts and sending it down the inside. So I'll be keeping an eye. Yeah. It's been a challenging weekend, to be fair. I've not been comfortable with the car, not been comfortable with myself, and it just sort of all came towards me in Q3, to be honest, even the end of Q2. That was my first good lap of the weekend and probably the first lap where I felt semi-reasonable, but I knew I had a bit of margin to go further. And then my lap one in Q3 was really strong and then obviously matched it on the second lap. So pretty pleased with that. I don't know, to be honest. I mean, sometimes some weekends you just hit the ground running a bit sooner. Other times you don__. I've found this weekend quite strange. The grip has been really high from the tarmac, but the cars have been sliding quite a lot. It feels a bit reminiscent of Miami, where it's really high grip, but the car is sliding. And I just didn't have much confidence in myself, and obviously the crash yesterday set me back again. But I always sort of remind myself, it doesn't matter what happens on Friday. It's Q3 when it counts. Yeah. A bit more of a snog_ in between the two. So, no, it wasn't too bad. And it's always when you're on a really strong lap and you just touch the wall like that, you're a little bit tentative going into the next corner because you just don't know if you've got a puncture or if the car is just going to spin out on you. And obviously, it's a very fast corner, but all good in the end. Probably these two next to me, to be honest. We know the McLarens are usually exceptionally good on their tyres in the hot conditions. I think we've all been a little bit surprised at their sort of lack of pace this weekend. We were probably all expecting them to run away with it, and we certainly didn__ anticipate being in the fight for pole position here. So, not sure going into tomorrow. I'm the only driver who hasn't done a long run, so that doesn't play into my favour. But, of course, overtaking is challenging here. Races have been a bit of a one-stop recently, but now with the 80 km/h speed limit in the pit lane, it probably brings it closer to a two now. Yeah. I'll run it. I've run it in a couple of races this year. It isn__ the perfect solution yet. And the fact is you have no testing _ you can only test it in a race environment. The race in Bahrain, I was happy with it. I ran it in Saudi as well, I was happy with it. But of course, here it is much hotter. The dry ice will melt faster. To be fair, the team have made a big improvement with the car cooling itself. We recognised some major issues of hot air seeping into the cockpit, massively exceeding 60 degrees at certain races. Just moving a few electrical boxes around and hydraulic lines that are running at 120 degrees around your feet has a major impact on the heat. But as I said, I__l trial it. I__l give you an answer tomorrow.
OP: I still don't know if I'm going to use it. I used it yesterday. I think the problem with the suit is it's great when it works, but if it fails, it's even worse than not having it. And like George said, there__ no testing to really try it out. There is winter testing, but I think everything__ going to feel pretty good when it's 10 degrees. So, yeah, I still don't know if I'm going to run it. I think the initiative is good, but like Max said, having the choice to use it or not is important because there are benefits and downsides. Yeah. Thanks for reminding me!",Singapore,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, that's what happens when there's a car in front of you just cruising two seconds in front. So that's noted. Will be remembered as well. Not Oscar. So yeah, that was a bit of a shame. Otherwise, I think it could have been close for pole. It was very exciting here in qualifying. Of course, a little bit disappointed to not be first, but for us this weekend so far has been really good. Yeah, the car has been very competitive, so for us to be second again is very good. Yeah. It was close. I mean, the lap itself was coming nicely. But, again, around here to nail all the corners is very tough. Unfortunately, I had a car, like, two seconds in front of me in the final chicane. So in qualifying, you cannot have that. You cannot have any kind of disturbance when you want to push in Q3, and that's what happened. I had to abort the lap because of that. So that was a bit unfortunate. Otherwise, I think it would have been a very close battle for first, but it is what it is. Nothing you can do about that. So you just move forward. I think for us so far this weekend has again been a very solid one. No major trouble. We were always kind of there, and I guess that__ good. So that is, of course, for us very promising. Yeah. Like the last two races, really. I don't know. I guess we'll wait and see. Not really too bothered about it. Yes and no. It depends on the race, Safety Cars, when they come or not. You just need to be ready for everything. Absolutely. The last three weekends now have been really, really nice. I mean, up until that point, we were always throwing the set-up left and right because it was just not working. Sometimes you had a weekend where it was okay, but now, the last three weekends, it's been solid. We've just been fine-tuning, and that's exactly what you want throughout the weekend. Of course, some layouts will be a bit better for us, some probably a bit more difficult, but the basis of the car is a lot more solid, and I think that is what you need. I mean, you said it already. No? Lando. To clarify, well, in qualifying you always try to leave gaps of six, seven seconds at least because you want no disturbance. Normally in Q3 you don__ see a car _ unless you're on a different programme. But I think around here, it's quite clear what you want to do. So you leave quite big gaps, everyone. But then, of course, sometimes it happens on a street circuit that people are bored, make mistakes. So, yeah, when you get a car two, three seconds in front of you_ I mean, you need every kind of clean air that you can have on a lap, especially because you're fully on the limit with braking and everything. And I lost a bit of downforce with that, so I went straight on. Yeah, that__ it. And then with the vest, I haven't used the vest. I'm also not intending to use it because I feel like this needs to be a driver choice. Of course, from the FIA side, they will always throw it on safety, but then we can talk about a lot of stuff that can be improved on safety _ including pit entries in certain places. I think that has a bit more priority than a vest in the car because I don__ like it. I don__ like the tubes that are on you, on your body, with the belts that go next to you. Then they can say it__ a bad design. I disagree. It just needs to be an option for the drivers to choose. Some like it, some don__, and that__ fine. It should be a personal preference. And I know this year we can, but probably next year they don__ want to do that, and I feel that is not the right thing. The problem is that in GT cars or any other cars, prototypes, you have a bit more space to put stuff or at least put the cables. In our cockpits, it__ so narrow that there is no space _ or at least not enough space. And that is also a little bit of a problem I find. Plus, where are you going to put the dry ice? The cars are not designed really to have this extra kind of space, and within 15, 20 laps, it__ anyway gone. And then you have hot water_ or tea. No. I think it's quite clear, you know, that's something that is not nice when it happens to someone. I think in general, we are always quite good at that _ all the drivers. We try to stay out of the way. I mean, sometimes of course it's always a bit more complicated in certain scenarios. So every scenario is a bit different. But in this case, in Q3 with only 10 cars on the track, I think it could have been avoided. The walls, they actually move around the track (laughs). I don__ know if you guys noticed but it__ quite tricky in some places!
GR: I'm a very different driver today than I was a couple of years ago. Yesterday was my first crash in over a year. But this season, I'm sort of more within myself. I know the limits better. But the fact is, on a street circuit, you__e only got to have a 1% lapse of concentration. My mistake two years ago, it wasn__ a big mistake. It was a mistake of five centimetres, but the consequence was massive. And that's the thing on a street circuit. You can't afford one single corner not to be 100% focused. But that__ the greatness of it too. Yeah. I mean, what can I say? You never had pole here _ you can ask that to many drivers why they never had pole here, right? That__ just what happens. The last few years, it's not been easy. I mean, 2022 _ that was a good opportunity, but you need to, of course, put enough fuel in the car for qualifying. And then, of course, it would have changed the perception a bit, because I hear this now the whole week: __ever had a pole. Never won here._ Well, fantastic. But yeah, now finally, the car is a bit more all-round, it seems. We've always been, I would say, a little bit weaker on super high downforce for whatever reason. But for us to be this competitive, for sure, is very promising. Whatever happens tomorrow happens. But even for upcoming races, where you're not always running the super high downforce, I think it will be nice if we can just keep this momentum going.",Singapore,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. You know, obviously, I would have wanted more, but I don't think we had four tenths in it to go and get pole. So, ultimately, pretty happy. Feel like it's been a good weekend so far and built up through it nicely. And yeah, ultimately, it was a pretty clean session, so that's all I can ask for. Yes. I mean, I think my first lap of Q3 felt reasonable. It certainly didn't feel four tenths off bad. So I just don't think we had the pace tonight, which is a little bit of a surprise for us. It has been very tight through all of practice, but I think we were relatively confident going in. So, yeah, some things to look at and see where we're lacking. But we've not had the easiest last couple of weekends. So it's not a huge surprise in some ways because of how it's gone recently, but I do think we felt after practice we had a better chance. Not really. Anytime on a street circuit you don't do laps is frustrating, and I did feel like through Q1 I was playing catch-up a little bit. But ultimately, it didn__ really affect much. It was obviously frustrating to have a yellow flag thrown for someone getting out of the way. There's been a lot of adjustments on the yellow flags and stuff like that, but I think there's still some tweaking to do there, because Alex did the best job he could to get out of my way, and it ended up costing me a lap anyway. So, some things to look at there. I hope so, but it's very tough to overtake around here. You need a fair bit of extra pace to get past someone. So we'll see if we've got that tomorrow. But the long running has been kind of tough for everyone with red flags, and no one's really done that much. So I wouldn't say we've got more confidence than we had going into qualifying for the race, but we'll see what's possible. Did I hit a wall in Q3? I think that probably answers it. I didn't even know I touched the wall. No. I mean, I think tomorrow's race is just all about trying to do the best I can. There__ a lot of things that can happen around here. It__ a tough race _ Safety Cars and stuff like that. So, I__l do the best that I can. Obviously, if there's an opportunity to finish higher than I'm starting, then I'll try and take it. I'm not just going to settle for the position I'm in or any position just ahead of Lando. I want to maximise the race I can get because any extra points I can win is only going to help me. So, just try and do the best job I can and see where we end up.",Singapore,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Confident. Because like you said, last year was a very good one here. We were very strong here last year. I had a good race, so always nice. I have always enjoyed it since my first year in 2019. So, at the minute, it looks like a little bit worse weather than what we've had over the last few years, but excited. It's one of my favourite tracks of the season, so happy to get going. Genuinely a challenger. I think if you go back to the beginning of the season, they were challenging the first six, seven races for race wins, challenging us in the Drivers_. And then we brought some upgrades, improved a little bit. Couple weeks ago, they brought some upgrades, and it seems like that's kind of put them back on the same level as us. So, I think we're still expecting and we still come into every race with the ambition and with the goal of winning and wanting to dominate as a team and continue the form that we've had all season. But nevertheless, you know, it's a track where Mercedes, Ferrari, and Red Bull, certainly over the last few weekends, have been closer. So we expect battles, especially with him. I mean, yeah, the driver's! Car's mediocre! But, I mean, without making a joke of it, I think you got the two things. You obviously need the best car. I think we've had that for 95% of the races. I think there's been a few here and there. Like, even Monza is the most recent one where I don't think we were quick enough. Baku, I would say we probably should have been and were fast enough. We just didn't do a very good job. Monza, we weren't quick enough. So, you know, there's been a couple races where we've not had the dessert__ike, the perfect weekends. But as a constructor, I think that's the important thing. We've got two good drivers. And I think there are plenty of other teams with two great drivers, but I kind of hate saying it, but not ones who have delivered every weekend as often as what Oscar and myself have done. But it's also easier for us to deliver because we're ahead of the field a lot of the time. So in some ways, we have an easier job than some others. But as a constructor, you need two drivers who deliver every weekend, who finish most races. And that's what we've been able to do. Maybe not the last couple, but until that point, we've been the best performing duo as drivers. And we've clearly had the best car and been the best team. I mean, you ask me this question every time, and it's the same answer. Yeah. Just play the clip from last time, I guess. I mean, there's a chance, so_ more than zero. I don't know. It's probably, like, actual stats. So, I don't know. Yeah. There's a chance. Yeah. Good for him. I thought he was doing a test in a Mercedes. No? Was he not? I don't know. But I guess nice for him and the team. They probably didn't want it to end the way it did in some ways, or for those kind of things to happen. But he's been racing since. For him to get back into a Formula 1 car, his dream, and kind of get back probably some good memories that he had was a nice thing for him. So nice to see it. Well, I mean, it__ be easier if I was always finishing first and him third, but that's not going to be the case. So, you know, it's difficult to know. I think certainly in Baku, we had the pace to win and we had the car to win and we didn__. I don__ think we necessarily had the pace to be on pole, but I think we had a chance to fight and had the chance to fight Max. In Monza they were just too quick for us.
So if there__ some races coming up where they__e just too fast _ which is very possible _ he qualified one tenth behind me here last year, even when we were already dominant, he was only one tenth off. So I expect him to be quick for many of the races this season. We're going to go to Vegas, another low downforce track where we don't expect to be as great as we have been in other places. So I think there's still opportunity. We know there's opportunity for them. But as long as we're just focusing on ourselves, and I__l try and maximize every result I can, whether that__ on Saturday or Sunday. I mean, it's cool. It's nice he can go and do what he wants. I think after you win four world championships, you have a bit more right to just go and choose what you want to do. Everyone knows how much Max loves doing all those things. And yeah, it's nice that he goes to do something else that he enjoys. But you can do what you want. Like, I don't know how much it adds to your greatness or not, but the fact he can go into any series and be probably the best, I think does show how good he is and how great he is. I've said it many times. I think he's born to be, and will forever be, one of the best ever, if not the best in Formula 1. So I think for anyone to have a chance of going up against him and beating him is pretty slim at times. But no, it__ cool. I respect it. I think it's a great thing. If I could go and do it more, maybe I would. But I don't know about my future still. Like, I still see a time when I__l just want to leave Formula 1 and go do other things _ go play golf and have some fun elsewhere. But I respect a lot what Max does, and I respect Max a lot, like I've always said. But yeah, I__e not seen any of it, but I love the Nordschleife, so that is probably another place I would love to go and try at one point. I'm very concerned. Yeah. Very worried about it, and scared, frankly. So yeah, I was happy you asked that, actually_. Yeah_ No. No, not a worry at all. I mean, any driver can go and do what they want, you know?",Singapore,thursday,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"I think since the summer break, obviously, we had very good Zandvoort as a team. The quali was definitely not great, but we were able to have very good car pace through the race and come back in very decent positions. After that, I think the tracks were quite difficult for us. There were some areas of the track where we were lacking quite a lot of pace _ in Baku and Monza.
But I hope that here we will have more performance out of this car. It's a track that I really enjoy, especially since they removed that last sector that I didn't really like too much. Yeah, I've learned to like this track more and more, to feel more comfortable with it through the years, and it's a track that I now really like. And there's a lot of support around here also, so it's quite special. I hope so. I mean, usually, where we lose quite a lot of performance is in the straight lines. There are not many of that around here. We are pretty good in terms of traction, getting out of corners, and low-speed performance is also pretty decent. So again, it's going to be very close out there. It's looking like it would be quite tough with the weather, so we need to see which sessions are going to be dry and if the important ones are going to be dry as well. But it's out there to take the opportunity, and I hope that we can take a good one. It was awesome. And, you know, we had most of our employees that were there. It was a big Haas family day. Everyone was there to witness Romain driving an F1 car five years after his accident in Bahrain. And it was a day full of happiness and emotions, really, and I'm glad to have been there to witness it all. Romain didn't lose anything. He was straight away on pace. He knew everything on the steering wheel and everything, obviously, you know, it's only been five years, but yeah, definitely a great day. And this team is very special in that sense _ there are emotions. Obviously, we are a small team, but it's really a big family. And even though it was five years ago, the team didn't forget that Romain was there from the start, and that's quite special. I mean, we all know Max and how dangerous he is when there's something to grab. So yeah, there's a good chance that if he's got a competitive car until the end of the year, he can catch back. Good friend. Awesome. Yeah, I think that was really cool. I watched some of it. Obviously, it was a very long race, but I was definitely looking. I__e done some testing and developing on some cars on the Nordschleife last year because I wanted to learn the track and have a feel for myself. I__e been racing this track on Gran Turismo for years and years. And to have seen Max going there and winning the race was obviously incredible. No doubt of how good he is. Remarkable to say the least because we have a very busy schedule _ he__ playing a world championship potentially. He__ won already four, which helps in his decision on going or not to do other things. But yeah, if I was in his position, I would probably do the same, definitely. But it is not the case. If Max likes to do other types of racing, it's his right. And if the team lets him do it, he's going to do it for sure. It was a very different scenario for Robert. And yeah, we are always all thinking, what if that didn__ happen for Robert? Even his comeback in Formula 1 was awesome. I__e raced against him _ George also _ in the same team. That was an incredible comeback. But yeah, I'm sure we would have seen him on the top step many more times than what we did. Yeah. I think it is, definitely _ especially in long periods where we don__ race, basically from November to _ I mean, February now next year. We will drive in January, so it will be very different. But yes, I feel that it's very useful just to keep your eye in, get more car control. I do a lot of drifting sessions as well during the winter, some go-kart driving or buggy driving. It__ just something I enjoy, but I feel that it is useful at times when you are in certain tricky situations _ on the wet or whatever. You lose the car at one point, well, you get your eye in because you__e done that corner and that situation a million times, basically, in the winter in some other cars. So it__ more the old school guys that were saying how good it was and valuable for them to race in many different categories. I mean, it's so specific now, F1, that might be a bit less, but you can still get some stuff from other series and learn new things, new skills. As long as you can be in a good car on four wheels on a racetrack, I think it's always valuable.",Singapore,thursday,Haas
George Russell,"Surprise. No dates to give you. I told you you'd be the first to know when there's something to report. I think for any driver, when you get to a certain point in your career, things have to be done right. Every time you renew a contract, it's the most important one of your life and it has to be done with good care. There's nothing to worry about, and it will get done when it gets done. How many of these questions? You keep on going! No, I don't think so. I think it's just about something that's fair, mutually beneficial. I think that's what we all chase. It's obviously different for certain drivers who may have a bit more power, may have a bit less power. But as I said, no more updates. Nothing to report. I'll be glad to tell you all once there is. Yeah. Feeling better, to be honest. Baku was a tough one just in terms of how I was feeling. Not 100% right now. I've improved substantially. But if I think there's any other race, I wouldn't have a single shred of concern. But, of course, Singapore being Singapore and the obvious challenges here, I'm sure it will be fine _ but Sunday won't be a breeze. Yeah. We've used the driver cooling vest a few times already this season at the hot races.
But obviously, this is the first time where it's become mandatory, which I think is good news.
Not everybody finds the top comfortable, but I think some find it more comfortable than others.
And of course, over time, you'll be able to adjust it to your own preferences. But the concept is good. When you're racing in 90% humidity and the cockpits are getting on for 60 degrees, it's a bit of a sauna inside the car. So I think we all welcome it. I think the last two years, we've been reasonably good. Ferrari are often very strong here. They were on pole two years ago, and last year they were looking really strong until Q3, which sort of ruined their weekend. And of course, we know McLaren at the hot races, high tyre degradation circuits, are exceptionally strong. So I expect McLaren and Ferrari to be the two teams out in front. I mean, I can't talk for the other drivers. I think it's just where the tubes on your back connect to the tubes on your front, and they have to go around your ribs. And when you go through high-speed corners and the g-force, you're feeling these tubes on the side of your ribs. So I think that was definitely an issue for me at the beginning. They made some changes _ it has been improved. But as I said, still, you have these tubes going around your ribs, which is not the perfect place for it. There__ not many high-speed corners here in Singapore and high lateral G-forces, so I don__ think it would be a major issue. 100%! Yeah. I mean, obviously, for us who were sort of in the race and witnessing it, I still sort of remember it to this moment. Seeing the flames in my rearview mirror _ extremely horrific to see.
And I don't think anybody wants to end their career in that way, so to see him get a chance to go back out _ he's obviously always been in great spirits ever since the incident. Of course, he was in _ I can't remember if it was Abu Dhabi or Bahrain _ the following race, but he was there on the sidelines from the following race. You know, his spirits have never dropped. So yeah, nice for him and nice of Haas to give him the opportunity. Yeah, I think it's incredible, to be honest. Like the two guys said, I think we're all pretty jealous of it. Because having this freedom, of firstly doing what you love in Formula 1, but then also being able to go out and race other things and just enjoy it at your leisure _ I don__ think it__ quite that straightforward for other people doing it. But you have that right when you win four world championships. And we're all here fighting to win our first. Maybe after four championships under our belts, we'll be able to choose to do the same. But no, respect it a lot. And definitely, I would love to do it one day. I think the biggest thing for Singapore that's improved the race is removing the last sector corners. Now, that back straight_ I mean, as drivers, you never want to remove corners, but I think before it had 20-something corners, and it was too much. Now it__ a much nicer flow to the circuit, and I think we're all in agreement that we hope the circuit stays like this and doesn't return back to its previous state. But yeah, in the past it was always like a one-stop because the pit lane took so long. I think it's four or five seconds shorter now with this 80-kilometre per hour limit. So maybe it goes more towards a two, but recently a lot of races have been a clear one-stop. So, yeah, I think the rain will probably be the next thing that will spice it up. I think you have to do what you enjoy in life, and there__ a risk in everything. You know, we can slip on the padel court and break a leg, as an example, or you fall down the stairs in the morning. So I think, obviously, there are certain things that have a greater risk. Obviously, rally is probably a higher risk than racing a GT3 car on a racetrack. But ultimately, we all have to do what we enjoy. This is life. A lot of drivers go skiing as well. You know, you can__ wrap yourself in bubble wrap. No, I don't think so. It shouldn__, to be honest. Yeah, things are moving and progressing.
And as I've said on numerous occasions before, between races it's not like we sit at home on the sofa with our feet up and nothing else is going on. You know, I've been in Brackley and Brixworth this week, working hard on the sim, looking ahead also to next year. Last week, a couple of sponsor events, training, getting back in shape. So, our schedules are extremely busy. And as I said, there is no necessary danger of that happening. But if it does, it does _ but I don't expect it to.",Singapore,thursday,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"I don__ think we can expect any miracles. I don__ think we were, I mean, again in Baku, I don__ think we were uncompetitive. We didn__ do a good job in qualifying and we failed to put everything together and to put a lap in Q3, obviously, but I don__ think we expect to be more competitive here. I think it should be similar to Baku. If anything, I feel like McLaren will have even more of an advantage on a track like this, so we might be a bit further away to McLaren. However, compared to our main competitors, which are Mercedes, we should be in a better place if it stays warm, which I think it will. Well, I hope the same happens. But in Hungary, it__ a session I still struggle to understand. There were swings of seven tenths from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, and nobody really understood that session. To be on pole on such a difficult session was nice, but I don__ expect the conditions to be the same this weekend. It__ unlikely, but I__l do everything to reproduce that. That would be amazing, but it__ unlikely. I think we are in a very different place to last year. However, to resume it in the simplest way, I feel like Mercedes is very strong whenever it__ cold, and we seem to be stronger whenever it__ warm. Looking at the next few races, I hope it__ as warm as it can get, so we have an advantage. I feel like this is what is going to swing the performance one way or another more than any other track characteristic. This is where we stand, and we__l see how it goes. But this weekend should be warm, and we need to take that as an opportunity for us to close the gap to them. I__l say 20. The gap is substantial. We__e been on low-downforce tracks, Monza, Baku. I feel the Red Bull was very strong. I expect McLaren to come back to the pace we__e seen for most of the season here and at some other future tracks. I see it very unlikely, but we never know. They brought an upgrade in Monza which seems to be working very much, but whether it will work on a high-downforce track, I don__ think enough to beat McLaren. I think it__ very unlikely, just because unfortunately McLaren is also very strong when it__ warm. Compared to our main competitors, we might be stronger__o, against Mercedes, I think we have chances to be stronger on those races, and I think we__l be stronger on those races. However, compared to McLaren, I don__ think we__l have the upper hand. But never say never. I__ looking forward to seeing where we are this weekend. Maybe another chance might be Vegas, where things are so strange on this track__yre management, etc can be a big thing in the race. Maybe there will be an opportunity as well, but very little opportunity__ess than the number I said for Max earlier for the championship! Quite unlikely. I didn__ change my physical preparation for the weekend. Yes, we are doing_ at least on my side, yes, I do things a bit more specific for Singapore, but my goal is to be as fit as possible from the first race to the last race. It__ not like I start training more for Singapore because I__ training as hard as I can over the season. Maybe you do some sauna sessions before Singapore, which helps acclimation with the heat. The only thing that changes with what the FIA announced is we now have the choice to run the cooling vest, which is something we__l consider and keep in mind throughout free practices in case it__ way too warm in the car. I don__ expect this weekend to be harder than last year, and last year was very warm and very tough, but it was still doable. It__ something I will keep in mind for sure. I agree 100% with Isack! It will be faster. It will make the two-stop a little bit faster and closer to the one-stop. Whether it will change significantly the strategy, I don__ know. It remains a track where it__ difficult to overtake, so for that reason you don__ want to stop too often. We__l see how it goes. It also depends on how much the tyre is degrading, and for now we don__ know yet. Drivers are always pushing back! For sure it increased, and it gets to a point where you have to think at one point it has to affect performance because, at the end of the day, we are athletes. Recovery is important. We__e got more and more races. We__e got more things to do at the factory, especially on a year like this. I think that__ the year where we feel it the most because you__e got the new regulations coming with so many new things. We are requested at the factory a lot more, plus the sponsorship events, which makes it quite tricky to manage it all. It__ a balance to find. We cannot do what we do as a team without the support of the sponsors, and in those cases you__e got to give back. So it__ a balance to find, but for sure, on a season like this, it__ tougher than other seasons. We are all disappointed as a team, and especially with Ferrari you are always targeting to be back on top and not to fight for second, third, or fourth place in the Constructors_. That__ not what we want. We are not happy, and we__e got to do better. That__ very clear for every member of the team. Honestly, if I knew exactly the area where we are lacking, it would be easy work. It__ not as easy as that but what I can say is that Mercedes, Red Bull, and ourselves kind of did the same step from last year to this year, but there__ one team that found something special, and that is McLaren. Now it__ up to us to understand what they__e done so special in order to close that gap. I think Red Bull probably found part of the solution__e could see that in the last few races. Mercedes and ourselves didn__ yet, and we are working towards that. We know the areas; how we achieve that is another story, and there__ a lot of work to understand and find the solutions. McLaren did a step that nobody else did.",Singapore,thursday,Ferrari
Isack Hadjar,"It was just_ I was lucky enough to have_ My sister was free and she brought her friends and my high school friends in Japan, so, surprisingly, we were a group of 10 people in Tokyo. I just got lucky that it was around my birthday as well. I got free time, and I just made the most of it, so I had a very good time. Obviously everyone__ talking about how hot it is inside the car, so it__ going to be a tough race. But honestly, so far this year I__e always felt comfortable in the car. Let__ see. I__ quite excited to see how hard it__ going to be. Apart from the sauna, there__ not much you can do. Japan is quite humid, so I__e spent a week already there, so maybe this is going to help me. But I just have to push through, I guess. Again, it__ going to be a track where_ Obviously, the car is working pretty much everywhere. It__ a healthy car. Now it__ slow-speed corners, just like Baku. Honestly, I__ rather be on a track with a bit more high-speed. I think this matches more our car__ characteristics. But the car will work again this weekend, there__ no hazard. I can__ tell you if it__ a podium car, but it__ definitely a car that can aim for Q3. The car worked well there, but I know the Williams was also very fast. I know Alex was very fast in Monaco, I remember. But we, as a team, did a good job putting it together and just maximising the result. The car will definitely be up there. I definitely agree with what he said. 20% as well. I think 20 is a lot; I would say 10. Ten is still a good number, but I don__ know how many points__e__ probably 60 points behind Oscar? Oh, yeah, 69. It__ a good position to be in, but at the same time my whole career I__e been used to having to chase until the very final race__very championship I__e been in__o try and prove and go up the ranks. It__ a new place to be, but it definitely takes out a bit of pressure. If anything, I always enjoy the pressure. I feel like it__ when I__ delivering at my best level. Let__ see how I handle the last few races, but I__ always going to push very hard and take risks. Very well explained, Charles. Copy paste. I never drove with 60 here, so I don__ really care, actually. Maybe it makes the two-stop more affordable, if anything. That__ it. It__ less time in the pits. It__ better for racing, and that__ all really.",Singapore,thursday,RB
Alex Albon,"I__ say it__ not normally a track that we__e gone well at, but we__e proven a lot this year that it doesn__ really carry over from previous years. It__l be interesting to see where we fall. We generally don__ like high-downforce circuits, but we__e noticed we are quite good on ride, and obviously this track__ quite bumpy. So maybe one weakness is one strength, and we can do a good job here.
Q: Were there any pointers in Baku last time? I know it was a slightly tougher weekend for you, but a great one for your team-mate. Realistically, over the weekend in Baku, we were strong the whole weekend. It was literally just qualifying. A bit frustrating in hindsight, obviously. Carlos proved how quick the car was, and it was a bit of an uphill battle for me starting at the back after the crash. It is a very different track even though you__ think it__ similar to Baku. The demands, the track temperature and the way the bumps are around this track, it does offer a different need. I__ maybe a bit more pessimistic going into this weekend but I still think we can score points. Truthfully, the whole attitude this year has shifted. I don__ feel like the podium has necessarily invigorated the team more because I can tell you at Grove everyone is super motivated. The culture and the energy is addictive, and you don__ really feel like there__ much more that the podium gave, more than, if anything, proving a point. It__ almost a bit of a taste, I hope, for the future of the team and for us. It__ a sign of things to come. Maybe it came a little earlier than we thought it would, but it shows that we__e working in the right direction. I__l go with 15. You could have one crash between Lando and Oscar, and it__ all game on. I don__ know what the odds are at the bookies, but I__l go 15. I would say it was coming at some point, and I don__ think the race itself proved that we could do it. We__e had a few P5s already this year. If anything, it__ more just a validation _ to Grove and to everyone that we__e on the up. I think we__e the most improved midfield team by far, I would say. It feels like every year we__e made a big step, and this year is clearly the bigger one of all the four years I__e been in the team. Maybe it__ naive, but I__e always been confident in the team and the journey that we__e on. I always knew there was going to be a podium coming soon. We__l keep trying to make it more consistent and have more opportunity to do it. I always thought it was going to be a thing. Culture, in terms of belief and confidence. When I first joined the team, there was an element of just being low down. I think they kind of expected __his is the way and this is where we belong._ There__ been a huge shift in terms of open-mindedness, willingness to experiment in general, and this hunger to move and be a top team. That__ very much down to James and the key individuals within the team who__e moved that [dial]. It__ not an easy thing to do, and it shouldn__ go unnoticed just how different the atmosphere is in the team from day one when I joined to now. In all honesty, I signed with Williams and there were elements of good qualities about the team, but it wasn__ always that obvious that the team was going to end up in the position that has happened and seeing this journey we talk about. The bigger shift has been the last couple of years, where a lot of the big foundational elements of the team have changed. It__ interesting to me, because the step from _23 to _24__eople must have seen that as a backstep in terms of performance__ut actually the ground roots of the team changed the most at that point. That__ been one of the biggest steps of all the years I__e spent with the team. What you__e seeing this year comes from a lot of the changes we made a couple of years ago. I__ happy where I am. I like that James is very honest about our weaknesses and strengths as a team, and it makes the journey believable. It__ not __ext year we__e going to be at the very front._ It__ a calculated, realistic plan he has in mind. So far, it feels like we__e on the road he__ explained, and that makes me feel like I__ in a good place. I would never have said at the beginning of 2025 we would score a podium__nd almost on pace as well. No. But at the same time, when we did the shakedown in Silverstone in February, it was already clear we made a big step, bigger than I imagined. What__ exciting to me is we__e only, I would consider, 60-70% in our journey__aybe even less than that__nd yet we can score a podium at this time. There are so many areas we haven__ untapped that we know we need to improve on. But the job we__e doing with the resources we have, we can already nip at the heels of the top teams, which makes me believe even more that we can do a better job. I think it__ a nice thing that we__e got a choice at least to use this cooling vest or not. Different teams have different solutions, and within the cooling vest itself there are different ways to make it work. I don__ see it as a bad thing__nd I think it__ safe. It__ a good thing; it__ another step forward in terms of making all drivers comfortable. It__ likely I__l be using it for this weekend. As a team, Williams, we started using it early last year, experimenting, so I think we__e got a good grasp of how to make it efficient and work for us and make it comfortable. In terms of preparation, it__ not like I__ taking the cooling vest in the sauna with me__till preparing like normal. I work a bit more than maybe other drivers on it just because I feel the heat quite a lot. Same as Charles and Isack. It__ closer__here are more options now__ut as Charles said, it__ still hard to overtake here. Charles answered it really well. Different teams have different obligations, and some sponsors are more demanding than others, depending, up and down the grid. Some teams have different cultures as well towards the approach of performance over the commercial side of the sport. As Charles said, as drivers, we always fight for the free time. Our free time is now more and more valuable to us as drivers as well, so we do always try our best to reduce the days. I think that__ fair to say for everyone. There__ a lot to gain from driving different cars__all it a little bit like your __ocabulary_. You read a book, you increase your vocabulary; you drive different cars, you increase what we call our __oolbox_. You learn different ways to drive quickly and you figure out different techniques, different challenges, different criteria in terms of limitations with the car and how you drive around them. GT cars have electronics__BS, traction control__nd sometimes it feels like you__e driving to the limit of systems rather than the grip of the tyre, at least it did for me. Max is someone who just loves what he does and drives everything he can. If you speak to him, he really thinks about these things and tries to improve himself as a driver. It__ very cool to see someone have the kind of passion he does. I found my year in DTM very challenging, but I learned a different way to drive a car. Even now__arting, doing different things, even rallying, ice driving__here are loads of ways you can improve yourself to be more complete.",Singapore,thursday,Williams
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah. Honestly, I cannot describe how happy I am, how good this feels. This is even better than my first ever podium that I did. We've been fighting hard all year and finally today, we just proved that when we have the speed _ we've had it all year _ and everything comes together, we can do some amazing things together. And yeah, today we nailed the race. Not one mistake, and we managed to beat a lot of cars that yesterday I wasn't expecting to beat. Yeah. I'm extremely proud of everyone at Williams for pushing through our very difficult year. I think we've proven to everyone the massive step that we took compared to last year. We are on the rise; we are in the right direction. Unfortunately, with me, we've had a lot of bad luck, a lot of incidents _ very difficult to convert all that pace into results. But now I understand why it all happened, because the first podium needed to come like this. It's just life, you know? Life just sometimes brings you those bad moments to give you a very nice one, and this stays much better than any other thing that I was expecting. So, just a life lesson, to keep believing, keep trusting yourself, your team around you, your procedures, everything that you're doing _ because sooner or later, it always pays off. Thank you very much. The key was probably just nailing a perfect weekend from practice, quali, to race. It__ what I__e been looking for since the beginning of the season _ just to nail a perfect weekend. I think we had almost a perfect one in Jeddah when we scored maximum points, but then the rest of the season has been really up and down with a lot more downs than ups. Very unlucky in some cases. Job not well done in others _ by me or by other things that were in our control. But I always said to the team from the beginning that whenever a first big opportunity of fighting for a podium comes, as long as we have everything under control and nothing goes wrong and we prove to everyone what we__e doing, and we get that podium, then I__l be OK. And it__ exactly what ended up happening today. We had our chance starting from P2. Probably, if you asked many of us yesterday, we didn__ believe the podium was actually achievable with so many fast cars behind. But I think we__e had good pace this year, we just didn__ have many opportunities to show it. Today we had a very good opportunity to show our very good pace, and we managed to stay on the podium. Only George managed to beat us with very good pace, but it was a very well executed race. Yeah, 100%. This one means even more just because of, obviously, a year ago when I put my bet on Williams, and I said I__ going to this team because I truly believe in this project, and I truly believe that this team is on the rise. I__ very comfortable in this working environment, also very comfortable with everyone around me. And I have actually been pretty fast all year with the car. I think out of everyone that__ changed teams _ which is not an easy task nowadays _ I__e been very competitive from the first race, very quick, but I didn__ have results with me. I didn__ have results to prove to myself, the team, and everyone that some good things were about to come. But, in the end, they did. I think life has taught me many times that this sometimes happens _ that you have a run of misfortune or bad performances, but then suddenly life gives you back if you keep working hard with something really sweet like this. What everyone else does is not my business, to be honest. What I care about is that the first opportunity that I had to score a podium with Williams, and the first opportunity Williams had to score a podium, we took it, we scored it, and there it is. Not much more than this, to be honest. I think the podium is _ unless something crazy happens _ maybe our best chance. Probably Vegas will be our next best track to try and maybe put together a top five or a top six, which is what we sometimes can achieve when everything goes right. Apologies, it__ a tough ask. I__l fight for it if it comes, like you__e seen today. But the rest, for example in Qatar, I don__ think we will score points. That__ how much our performance swings. But then we will have the Austins, the Mexicos. We will be a pure midfield car where we can maybe get in the points and keep our championship going. So excited to see what happens in those races. Yeah. Obviously, I was racing for second the whole race, but I think it was around the first 10 laps of the Hard tyre where I was expecting to be clearly quicker than George on a new Hard versus his old Hard that I said, ""If now I can put my car in front of him before he boxes, we have a chance for P2."" But then they started telling me his lap times on those used Hards versus my new Hard, and I saw there was no chance. They were just simply too quick for us today. So congrats to him and Merc for that. Kimi was also coming quick behind, and I had to change my focus to getting the P3 rather than fighting for the P2. No. I thought maybe I could have done the same, if I knew. But I knew we had measured during the whole weekend that the left-hand side of the grid was a lot less grip than the right-hand side. So even if I was on a step softer compound, I knew that even with a good start and the short run to Turn 1, with that left side being very dirty, it was probably not enough to get him at the start. I still got a decent start, but it was not enough to put him under pressure. And I think for the Hard tyres, he must have done a good start. No. No. I just knew _ I think on long runs on Friday, I saw my lap times and I saw that I__
actually very quick, very competitive. So if it__ not easy to overtake back there, they__e going to struggle to get to me because I__ not slow. That__ why yesterday, I said I was dreaming about the podium, but in reality, I was kind of believing that if we nailed everything, we could actually make it happen because our pace has genuinely been good all year in this kind of tracks. I__e been quick. The car has been quick. And if we nail everything, I thought a top five was possible. And if we do everything perfect, maybe even the podium. Yeah. I think Singapore is very tough physically, but I think driving-wise, the race we just had here in Baku is probably the toughest of the year given the wind, the walls. The speeds that we do here is, for me, tougher as a driver than Singapore. But Singapore is more physically demanding.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Williams
George Russell,"Yeah. I mean, firstly, congrats to Carlos and Williams. Amazing result for them. I think for us, really happy to be back on the podium. It's been a bit of a rough weekend for me personally, but the car was great. Lewis came in P4 as well, so happy with that. Yeah, I was pretty glad when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest. I was fortunate _ I felt much better today than I felt on Friday and Saturday. So yeah, looking forward to a bit of rest now. But as I said, just happy with the result. And for us as a team, trying to beat Ferrari in the Constructors_ was a good step towards that. I think it was just staying out of trouble, to be honest. I don__ think we had a spectacular weekend, to be honest. And, obviously, Carlos just did an amazing job, and Liam also did a great job yesterday qualifying ahead of us. But all of the cars who we ordinarily fight sort of made mistakes or underperformed, and we sort of picked up the pieces. So, obviously, really happy to finish P2 all things considered. But also, I think the cool temps helped us a little bit. So just good to capitalise on all of those things. I think it__ very dependent circuit to circuit. Definitely, this weekend, the conditions and the circuit layout probably suited our car better than we__l see in Singapore. But right now, the field is so compact and overtaking is pretty difficult. So it seems like anybody can do an amazing lap and get themselves up the order. And, to be honest, it__ pretty incredible seeing the likes of Carlos, H_lkenberg, Hadjar on the podium this season. Well, fortunately, it was Baku. Even though it__ one of the toughest circuits, mentally and physically it__ maybe one of the easiest. So today I__ much better. Friday and Saturday, I was really rough. And, you know, had it been Singapore, as an example, I think I probably would have called it a day on Friday, to be honest, and probably wouldn__ have done the race. So, yeah, sort of fortunate timing. And I haven__ been ill for a couple of years, actually, so it just all sort of hit me at once these days, but I__ on the up now. Well, I think right now with the current form, there__ as much chance of Max finishing ahead of us as there is Ferrari, to be honest. Yeah, team Verstappen! But, yeah _ sorry, I lost my train of thought there. It just swings so quickly. Ferrari were looking amazingly strong on Friday here, and they__e always been great here. You know, Charles has been on pole four times here, and they could have easily been one-two on the grid. And with how difficult overtaking is, they probably would have finished one-two as well. But, obviously, they had a bad qualifying, and they came away with single-figure points, and we were the ones coming away with 30 points, so nobody knows. Same.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"They're all a bit different, but I think this weekend has been incredible for us. Of course, last weekend was already great. But yeah, for us to win here again is just fantastic. And I think also in the race, the car was working really well. On both of the compounds, we had clean air all the time, and you could then look after your tyres. And yeah, it was pretty straightforward. Of course, it's not easy around here _ very windy today, so the car is always moving around a lot. But yeah, of course, incredibly happy with this performance. I think in the race, always, you have to be a little bit more careful, right? Also, with tyre management and stuff, you want to make the one-stop work. So I think everyone was a bit more cautious with that anyway. Plus, of course, the compounds that we're running today _ Medium and Hard _ they weren__ really used that much up until today, and that all helped. And yeah, for sure I was happy that there were not too many Safety Cars. Difficult to say at the moment, but for sure the last two race weekends have been amazing for us. Singapore _ completely different challenge again with the high downforce. So we'll see what we can do there. I think overall, just a great weekend for us. I think for sure, you know, starting up front was key, especially in the beginning, just managing your tyres to go long. But, yeah, overall, very happy with how the race was going. I mean, I could go very long in that first stint. The car was doing pretty much what I wanted it to do. Just how much you commit, right, to push around here, which is not always easy with the layout of the track, the wind as well. It was quite tough today with that. But, yeah, we just stayed out until basically everyone pitted. And then there were only a few laps left on the medium, clearing a few backmarkers, which took a bit of time. But after that, just bringing it home. And for us, that__ another just great result. A bit unusual. This season has been really swinging left and right, but at least now two weekends in a row, it__ been going really well. I guess together with Monza. Yep. Monza has never really been a particularly strong track for us, so to do that, that was already a big plus. And I guess all in all for me here in Baku, it__ been alright, but never amazing _ apart from maybe '21, '22, I guess. But the rest has always been a bit difficult. So, yeah, to have a weekend like this, it was very important. Well, not so much from knowing how good it would be. It__ more like the start or an untimely Safety Car. So as soon as we crossed, like, 20 laps into the race, I was a bit happier, but it was a bit of a risk. I think it__ a bit unusual, of course, when you__e on pole, to start on the hardest compound that is available. But we did it, and I think it was the right call. We said before the race, well, one way or another one strategy will work, and we__l come out of the race happy with it. Luckily, we chose the right one. I mean, I don__ rely on hope. But it__ seven rounds left _ 69 points is a lot. So I personally don__ think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season _ just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we__l know. Well, I have never won. Red Bull has won, right? We__l see. It__ completely different. High downforce. A lot of deg on the tyres, so we__l see what happens. I really don__ know at the moment. Red Bull, no? Depends on a lot of things. If the car is shocking to drive, yes, it__ really hard to keep it in a straight line. But if the car is nice to drive, then it__ more about just the physicality of it. But at the same time, if everything__ going well, then you can relax a bit more, and then naturally it__ less physical as well. So, I don__ know. Let__ wait and see. I mean, it__ for sure always hot and you__e sweating a lot, so you have to prepare for that. But I guess we__e all done that _ heat training and stuff _ preparing for these kinds of races. Basically, just getting comfortable with the uncomfortable. I don__ mind it. It__ a cool track. Of course, I__e never won there, but it__ a cool feeling to drive there, and I hope this year we__l be a bit more competitive.",Azerbaijan,post-race,Red Bull
Liam Lawson,"Honestly, I can't even remember what happened. It was so busy. Obviously, it's still raining now. It was very busy. I said it would be, but I didn't expect it to be like that, honestly. But the car has been good all weekend. And when it needed to be in quali, it was good. So massive thanks to the guys and girls. The team's been amazing this weekend so far, but obviously, tomorrow's the important day. It's always sketchy because you see the rain coming on your visor and you can feel it. And you can kind of see the gloss on the track, but because the tyres are still warm, you have grip. So you're trying to fight your brain and not back off and keep pushing. But it's definitely tricky. It's going to be a very hard race for sure. We have a great starting position, but obviously, we're aware of who we're fighting around us, and that's what we'll be focused on. Yeah, it__ pretty cool. It was a good session. It__ been a good weekend so far. It__ been very tricky, though. I think that quali was one of the toughest ones we__e probably experienced _ trying to keep putting out laps, especially when the rain__ coming down. And the amount of red flags that there were as well _ it was definitely a challenge. But the car__ been good, honestly, all weekend. We__e just been fine-tuning, and I think it was in the right place. But when a session__ like that, honestly, it__ more down to just putting a lap together and making sure that you have good track position and don__ get caught out by these red flags. It__ really hard to know. Obviously, we__ love to stay where we are, but we__e aware of the guys that we__e racing as well, and we know that there__ some quicker guys behind us. So we__l try and obviously have a good start _ that__ the first thing. I think our long-run pace was okay, but honestly, when the conditions are as windy as they were today, it changes everything. So, yeah, let__ see tomorrow. I mean, for sure, it__ good to have these results. For me personally, it__ been something that has been tough, especially this year _ especially early in the season_ I think it__ been very, very close this year, but personally we just had a lot of stuff going on earlier in the year that was making qualifying more difficult, and it definitely wasn__ a strong point. So it__ important for me more than anything. Obviously, it helps, these performances, but we need more than one. We need to keep the consistency, and also points are more important as well tomorrow in the race. Honestly, I think for us in this position, when it__ this chaotic _ I mean, personally, I__ going to try and_ one a street circuit you have to push the limits anyway. You have to push the limits, and sometimes if you push a little bit harder, you can get rewarded. But obviously it__ very easy to crash here as well. So through quali, you__e managing it, trying to drive good laps, keep everything together and learn as much as you can with the wind and everything. But at the same time, with how much it__ changing, you start a new lap and it__ completely new, the feeling of the car, different corners _ and it can be really confusing. Especially over such a long lap, it__ very challenging for us. Yeah. I think we fuelled for the session, did the whole session, and just kept driving around! We made a mistake in Monza and took a bit of a risk, but we knew the car was fast. But just with how close it is this year you can still be fast and have something happen and get knocked out. So today, with everything that was going on and the conditions, we played it a bit safer and we maximised laps on track. We probably completed three or four laps but spent the entire qualifying _ when it was green _ pretty much on the track. So obviously for today, it worked for us.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,RB
Carlos Sainz,"Well, thank you everyone for the cheers. Yeah. Very happy. Honestly, we nailed the qualifying today. Every time being on the right tyre at the right time and putting together some very strong laps. Obviously, the moment that a top car was going to put that lap together, we were always going to be those four or five tenths behind like we always are, but it was only one of them, which was Max _ not surprised. And for the rest, we managed to beat them. And, yeah, we were in P2, which is great news. Yeah. Well, I've been putting good laps together this year in qualifying. It hasn't been my weakness or my issues at all. Again, today, we proved that the speed in this car and this team is there. I'm delivering in qualifying when it counts, and unfortunately, the year in terms of races and points is not going the way we want. But as long as the speed is there _ which, again, today proves that the points and the good races will come, and I'm not worried. Plan for tomorrow? Try to stick it on the podium. I think I'm going to give it my best to give Williams a first podium. If it's possible, great. And if it's not, we will see. Actually, the transition has been super smooth, and I__ very happy with everything that has been going on behind the scenes with Williams. First of all, the way I adapted to the car _ I was quick straight away from the beginning of the year. Everything that we__e doing behind the scenes to work on next year__ car, which is our biggest project and our biggest motivation as a team. Unfortunately, this year has just been one of those years where nothing comes together when it comes to Sundays and results. But today just proves that my speed is there _ that whenever I put good laps together and nothing happens to us, I__ quick. I have the speed. And, yeah, as long as that is there, I don__ worry. Just having a bit of bad luck or too many racing incidents recently and not being able to get all the points that we deserve as a team is tough. But if the speed is there and we__e working well on next year__ car, it doesn__ worry me. No, not really, because I knew my lap was good, but probably not good enough for pole. I mean, we know that if a McLaren or a Red Bull puts a lap together, that__ three to five tenths on average. And also if the track conditions were good enough _ which was the big unknown _ I knew my lap was not going to be good enough. I think our simulation said at the time maybe only Max and Lando could beat us. So I was thinking about a P3. In the end, it was only Max_ It had to be Max! But, in general, I thought as soon as I started my lap at the end, I was actually coming very quick. I was like three or four tenths up on my lap. And in one way, I was thinking, great, because this might even confirm or achieve pole, but then I was thinking the leaders are going to be even quicker, no? And that__ exactly what happened. It hasn__ been the smoothest weekend for me. I__e been struggling with the feeling on the brakes. With this car, we are having some brake issues in some demanding tracks like Canada and here. But today in quali, I felt good. And most importantly, we kept the car consistent through the weekend, and I think that allowed me to_ Whenever there was a chance to put a lap together _ which there were not many, I think I did in total three or four laps today in quali given the red flags _ the lap was good. So, tomorrow from P2, we__l try and keep it consistent, see the pace of the car versus every one of the leaders that will try and come through. But if you look at our long runs yesterday, we were actually pretty quick. So I__ hopeful that we can go for it tomorrow. Yeah, for sure. I mean, the tricky thing about today was, first of all, it__ very difficult to get into a rhythm because you__e not doing laps, not finishing laps, not spending time on track. Every time you have a 10-minute break in the garage, it__ always difficult to know where the track is when you go back out again, where the tyres are going to be, where the wind is going to be. So every time we__e going out again, it__ a bit of an adventure. And I think that__ why there were so many crashes. If you also think that F1 cars nowadays are a lot trickier to drive in the wind than in the wet, for example _ it__ completely unpredictable. You need to think that a car in mid-corner depends purely on its downforce, and 30 or 40 kilometres per hour of wind changes the downforce dramatically. And that__ what we__e getting _ every lap, a different level of downforce in the corner, and it always catches people out. It caught a lot of people out today _ probably the wind _ and it just shows. I don__ think people at home understand how tough the conditions were today and how easy it was to crash. I mean, to have the 20 best drivers in the world and seven or eight of them crashing tells you how tricky the session was today. Great. I think we__e shared it a few times now, the front row. No? Or no? I think in my Ferrari days we shared some front rows. I__e always enjoyed racing Max since my years in Toro Rosso. We had a very competitive year, full of learnings for both. I think it built us as the characters and the drivers that we are today. He__ going to be a mega F1 driver and probably will end up being one of the most successful ever. I__ just proud to be sharing the front row with guys that I__e been racing my whole life now. I think it__ great competition, but that__ what Formula 1 is all about.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Williams
Max Verstappen,"Long qualifying, to be honest, with so many red flags. So it was very difficult to basically get your lap together, because most of the time your tyres are not really ready or again, a red flag happens. So especially Q3, with also a bit of rain around, it was a very difficult session. And then in the final lap, you just have to send it. I wasn't even on the best tyres that I wanted, but because of all the red flags, you basically run out of tyres. And yeah, I'm very happy with how the weekend went so far. Because I think, you know, from FP1, we were not too bad, and we just kept on improving a tiny amount. And then we were there in qualifying, and that's, of course, where it matters. No. I think we definitely were in there for pole. Of course, Q3 is always a bit messy for everyone. But I'm just happy. Yeah. It seems like since Monza, we're doing a better job, and I hope that we can continue in that way. Yeah. Still, again, long race. Of course, you want to have a good start. But even then, we just need to do our own race, look after our tyres, because it's still quite tough on the tyres around here because of the softer compounds. And then, we'll see what happens. I think it was just a very long qualifying in general with all the red flags, so you never got into a rhythm. Trying to complete laps was already difficult enough with what was going on. Getting the tyres in the window on your warm-up lap is very tough around here. Honestly, I was quite happy with how Q1 and Q2 went, but Q3 was a very long wait, and then choosing what tyres to use for the final run _ there was a bit of rain around in places _ so not easy at all. But in the end, very happy to sit here. Yeah, I mean, this track is already hard enough without anything. With the strong winds that we had today, the car was moving around a lot _ understeer, oversteer in different places, even on the straight, going left to right. So, to basically nail everything, but also then the big interruptions that we had, it was just very tricky today. But luckily, I think we did quite well. Yeah, difficult to say at the moment. Of course, it__ a good starting position. We just have to try and do our own race, to be honest. Hopefully the car is kind on its tyres, that we can look after them, and just go from there. Well, it wouldn__ really matter too much because I think if anyone would have crashed, then there would have been no laps for the people that didn__ have a lap. So I just didn__ want to be first because you lose a bit to the line. So that meant that we were almost at the back, but that was OK. That was a call that we made. I think when I__ older, I won__ really care (laughs). I__l just think about other stuff, enjoy with my friends, family, and then maybe get some highlights _ like, __ell, yeah, that was good._ But it__ been a good year for sure. I__ happy with my performances. It seems like now we understand the car a bit better, which I think is the most important out of it. And then when I feel a bit happier in the car, you can extract naturally a bit more out of it. And that__ what we__e doing right now. So hopefully we can just keep that going. Yeah, I think Carlos answered that quite well. It__ also a long wait. Of course, you want it to finish a bit sooner, but at the same time there are a lot of calls that you have to make in the background with tyres, how many laps you want to do, warm-up procedure. But you also kind of know that that is a possibility around here with red flags. I honestly have no idea. We need to check.",Azerbaijan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, difficult beginning, definitely. I think maybe not my best first couple of laps, and then_ We seemed to have pretty good pace for the first couple of laps compared to Charles, and then I could get past. And then it was a pretty lonely race from there. Just struggled a little bit through the first part of the race. The car wasn't exactly how I liked, and once the tyres went away, it actually felt a bit better, which is never a great sign. So yeah, happy with the points, and I'll take it. Yeah, I mean, we went so long that the Soft seemed like a good tyre to put on. We were just staying out for Safety Cars, if we got any, but eventually Max got back into our pit window, so there wasn__ any point staying out much longer_ Yeah, a little incident at the end, but that__ okay. I think it__ fine. Not a bad weekend. Obviously, would love the performance to have been a little bit better, but all in all, I think there__ a lot of things to learn from this weekend. So happy going forwards, and we__l try and be stronger next week. It's something that we'll discuss. We have discussed it before. I think today was a fair request. Lando qualified ahead, was ahead the whole race, and lost that spot through no fault of his own. I said what I had to say on the radio. And once I got the second request, then I'm not going to go against the team. I think there's a lot of people to protect and a culture to protect outside of just Lando and I. Ultimately that's a very important thing going forward. Certainly not Max. I think with Lando, potentially, but even once I got ahead of Charles, I was struggling a bit. The balance just was not in a great place. I think as the Medium stint went on, we seemed to get stronger and stronger, and I felt like I got stronger and stronger too, which was nice. But ultimately just didn't quite have the pace. And once you got close to people, unless you had a fair bit more pace than them, it was very tough to stay behind. Yep. No, not really. We have had discussions about all kinds of scenarios and when you're in the same team, when there are things outside a driver's control, there's a lot more ways you can rectify things. So it is a discussion we've had. I'm sure we'll review it and discuss more, but it wasn't a situation that hadn't been discussed before. I think the radio call kind of says enough. I'm sure we'll discuss it again. I think if it's within your control and there's no other cars involved, it's quite simple. But if there's other cars involved, we're not going to give away all of those points to other teams for a mistake. When there's no cars in between, it's much easier to rectify it. So to answer your question, if there had been more cars in between, then no, we wouldn't have swapped back because at that point it does just become very unfortunate. I wouldn't regret it, no. I think today it was a fair decision. Lando was ahead the whole race and again it wasn't through any fault of his own. For me, that's fine. Ultimately, whoever wins the championship wants to have won it as much as they can through their own performances and things they can control. Today, that wasn't one of those things. We've said many times that we don't want the chance of success just for this year. There's a big regulation change next year _ we don't know how competitive we're going to be, and we don't know how competitive anyone's going to be. Ultimately, we want the best chance at winning championships for as long as we're Formula 1 drivers, and we're both at McLaren for a very long time. Protecting the people around us that give us this opportunity is a very important thing. It's easy enough to put yourself second at times like that. If we were fighting very closely for the whole race, then it's slightly different, but Lando was ahead by a few seconds the whole race, so there's no concern for me with that. Again, we don't just want this year to fight for a championship; we want it for as long as possible. Protecting the people, that includes the people doing the pit stops. It's not a very nice feeling, I would imagine. It's important to protect all the people that we have because that's what gives us a championship hope for years to come.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"A little bit! I had to! I tried to keep it, even on the braking to Turn 1. I tried to stay, but I always know it__ going to be a good fight with Max, and it was, so enjoyable, but just not the speed today, not the pace of Max and the Red Bull. A tricky one. One of the first few weekends where we were just a bit slow, but still fun. Still, a good race, so I enjoyed it. No, I don__ know. I felt like I was there for quite a long time, but I guess every now and then we make mistakes as a team. So, today was one of them. Yeah, I mean, I did everything I could today. I couldn__ do a lot more. I tried to fight against Max, but we had a good race and he came out on top, and they deserved it. So nothing more. Second was our best result, and I just need to keep doing what I__ doing. It was 19, no? I just don't want any misinformation! 19, yeah. It was a little bumpy at one point, but it was what I expected. It was close and it was fun racing.  Tough, again, as expected. Enjoyable _ it's what I probably enjoy more than anything, these kinds of battles. It was nice to go out on top for a couple of laps, but it didn't last very long. Max's pace was just far too good for us today, especially in that first stint, especially in the first three quarters of the first stint. Close, even when he got me into Turn 1, I think we were both pretty late on the brakes and we just about made the corner. It was close. I felt like there was probably a little bit of rubbing at some point. So, like, nerve-rackingly close and exciting for that reason. But I wish it could last a bit longer than it did. Just a tough race for us, not the pace we wanted. I think we were hoping to at least fight for a win. But Max's race was a bit too easy today. So, yeah, work to do, clearly, on our side. It's not my decision in the end. Got nothing to say. It was good. The main part I said was nerve-rackingly close was when he overtook me into Turn 1 on the outside, on lap two or three, whatever it was. That's the one where it's like, who wants to brake the latest? But I knew being on the inside that Max is in a much stronger position than I am. He can afford to be a lot more on the edge and aggressive than I can. I can't afford to lose a front wing or have a little bit of damage, whatever it might be. I felt like I took the risks that needed to be taken and did my part, but just not quick enough. If you look back at last year, it was pretty close between many people. The Ferraris, as well, were very strong there. We expect them to be good there. But it's pointless to guess. We go into every weekend with an open mind. We've been dominant, and I think that's always a positive thing at the end of weekends _ it__ when we come out when we__e had a one-two and sometimes it's a smaller gap, sometimes much bigger. But we still go into weekends with the expectation that anyone could be there, whether it is the Ferraris or the Red Bulls, most likely. We still think they could qualify ahead and they could beat us in the races. Therefore, we're not too shocked to have lost today and to not have been on pole yesterday. We knew already on Friday, FP1, it was not going to be a great weekend in terms of dominance like we've had. You have to look at things on the other side. We've had, you know, 95% have been amazing and we've won by huge gaps. So it just hurts that__ it__ a little bit the other way for once. But when you look at the flip side, there's still a lot more good races than bad. So we have to take it on the chin, learn from this weekend, and see what we can improve for the other lower-downforce tracks like Vegas. No. Because it's what we decided as a team, and it's what we all agreed upon. Yes. Because that's what we've agreed as a team. I think Oscar said it well. Every situation is different, so it's pretty stupid just to assume that kind of thing and say that's the precedent you set. We're not idiots and we have plans for different things. If there were four cars in between me and Oscar, of course he's not going to let me back past, and I don't think it's correct that he let me back past. But in a situation where we weren't racing, in a situation where we can just be fair, then you'd expect to be fair, as a team. They don't want to be the reason to upset one driver or another through no fault of their own, you know. Today was not my fault. If I came flat-out into my box and I hit all my mechanics out the way, I also don't expect to get the position back, but today was out of my control. In the end, I don't want to win this way through getting given positions or anything like that. And the same thing with Oscar__e don't want to lose or win like that. But we do what we think is correct as a team, no matter what you say or what your opinions are, and we stick to doing it our way. No. Not that I know of. Ask Andrea. That was beautiful. He said it well. I don't need to add any more. The team is the priority. The team is number one, then the drivers are second. That's how it works. Normally, when you see teams who don't have enough respect for the team and the opportunities the team gives, it doesn't normally last long. You see that with plenty of other teams, whether it's been Red Bull, Ferrari, or Mercedes. We want to try and be in this position for a longer period of time than what they have been at the top. Still early days _ it's only our second year of fighting for wins. But like Oscar said, the team gives us these opportunities. Without the team, then we're just fighting for tenth, and none of us want that. So team and the morale, the spirit of the team, is priority, and we're below that. I don't know why. I heard them. I hear the cheers louder than the boos, and that's the most important.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a great day for us. Of course, lap one was a bit unlucky, but then after that we were flying. The car was for me really enjoyable. I could manage the pace quite well throughout that first stint and I think we pitted at the right time. Then with the Hard tyres at the end, you can push a bit more, they__e a bit more resilient. And just a fantastic execution by everyone, by the whole team. I think the whole weekend we were on it. And yeah, it__ super enjoyable to win here. I could see that immediately the pace was quite good. I just needed to settle in. There was a lot of fighting going on, and then I could see the pace was there and quite quickly we were back in the lead. Well, we__l try for sure. We__l go step by step, race by race, but for us this was an unbelievable weekend. I would say probably a bit better than expected, but once I got back in the lead, I just tried to focus on my own pace and it kept on going, going well. I would say only the last maybe six to eight laps of that stint I started to struggle a little bit on the Medium. But up until that point, yeah, it was nice for once. The car was doing a little bit more what I liked. It just seems like this weekend has been another step forward with the behaviour of the car and that also then shows in the race, I think. So that was a big positive for us. Then, of course, we did a bit more of a normal strategy, you know, Medium__ard. Of course, McLaren stayed out to try and gamble for the Safety Car, and I think that's why the gap is a little bit bigger than it should have been. But still for us, an incredible weekend. That it's just not_ Well, before it felt like you were a passenger in the car. We had some races where it was just not balanced. And now, finally, there was more balance in the car and then the tyres also behave a little bit more normal. Yeah, it was. There was a lot going on after the first lap, even into Turn 1. I think Oscar and Charles were fighting as well. I could see in my mirror. So it took two, three laps to settle in a bit, and then from there onwards it was fine. You don't know. I mean, of course, you are pushing a bit to try and get ahead and then time will tell, right, in that stint if it was going to hang on or not. But after a few laps, it looked like it was going really well. I think it's still a bit track dependent. Here you drive low downforce. It always seems like our car is a little bit more competitive when it__ low- to medium-downforce. So it's not like suddenly now we are back. It's not like we can fight, I think, every single weekend. But the positive is that we seem to understand a little bit more what we need to do with the car to be more competitive. So I hope that that carries on into the coming rounds as well, and some tracks will be a bit better than others. Up until now we've had a lot of races where we were just shooting left and right a little bit with the set-up of the car. Quite extreme changes, which shows that we were not in control. We were not fully understanding what to do. With Laurent having an engineering background, he's asking the right questions to the engineers _ common-sense questions _ so I think that works really well. Plus, you try to understand from the things that you have tried, that at one point some things give you a bit of an idea of a direction, and that's what we kept on working on. I definitely felt that in Zandvoort already we took a step that seemed to work quite well, and then here another step which felt again a little bit better. I know you guys want a fun answer on that, but it's not my problem. Again, not my problem. It's better not to talk about it. It was a bit more of a joke because our engineer in sim racing with Team Redline always says that, he's just quite stressed sometimes. When I'm in the race, he's always like, ""Yeah, no risk, full push."" So that's why I said it. It was all under control. The car felt nice. The tyres were fine. GP, of course, wants to also just make sure that I'm driving without any risk, and that's what I did. I think already in Imola it was pretty similar. It's just nice to see that support. Of course, most of them are here to support Ferrari _ unfortunately they were not on the podium. But to see that crowd was incredible. Honestly, it's probably the best podium in the season in terms of what you see and how big the crowd is. They were very joyful, I would say, just having a good time, and it was nice to be part of it.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-race,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"No, nothing major. Turn 1 was a little bit average, but the rest of the lap felt pretty tidy. So, you know, I feel like I executed a pretty good session, built up to it a little bit at the start and found my feet. But I think it's just been incredibly tight this weekend. You know, Max and Red Bull looked quick this weekend. I mean, to be honest, a lot of teams looked quick. It's not been quite as comfortable for us. So, yeah, the result's not a big surprise, but obviously would have loved to be a little bit further up. No. I mean, when you're on the lap, you're going for it, and you're going for pole. You don't know what anyone else is going to be able to pull off. So, in the moment, yes, you're going flat out. I think, obviously afterwards, it creeps in a little bit, but, you know, there's still a long way to go. And I'll try and make up some spots tomorrow because I'd like a few more wins if I can. I mean, I don't think it looked too bad from where I was. I think it's been just a little bit trickier for us in general. Obviously, I missed FP1 as well, so that was kind of my first long run and, you know, the race is always very different. So I'm pretty confident with tomorrow. It was okay. I feel like Q1 was a little bit of a struggle, but then Q2 and Q3 I was pretty comfortable. It was a solid lap without being amazing, but I think it__ been clear for us anyway that the competition__ been much tighter this weekend, and also with some unexpected teams and cars. So it__ not a huge shock for us, but I felt like I managed it pretty well, just ultimately lacking a little bit at the end. It__ always hard to know how much it costs, but it__ definitely not what you would choose to do. Obviously, it__ in the rules, but I think there are worse tracks to miss for an FP1, so I don__ really want to put too much of it down to that. I would say yes. I think Q1 was a little bit tricky to get into the rhythm, but Q2 and Q3 I was pretty happy. I feel like I put in good laps that were clean and improved every lap I did. There are a couple of corners that I would probably like to do again, but I think it__ rare that you leave a qualifying session not having that feeling. So I__ pretty happy. I think reasonably confident. It is generally a strength of ours, but it didn__ look night and day above everyone else yesterday. So let__ wait and see. It__ a track where slipstreams make a big difference. The start can be pretty chaotic. So I think there__ going to be a few factors at play apart from just pure pace. I don__ think it__ a big surprise that it__ much closer here. Was Max at the top of my list of our competitors going into this weekend? I thought maybe Ferrari would be closer, but that__ based off last year. Generally, when the competition__ got close, Max has normally been the one that__ been the closest. So I don__ think it__ a massive surprise, but compared to last year it is a little bit.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"No, no. Max has been quick all weekend, and it's never a surprise with Max. So, no. I mean, it was quite a session for me _ just up and down and too many mistakes here and there. But to put it all together on the last lap, I was pretty happy. So I'm happy with P2. I mean, I always kind of give my result depending on how I drove today. So I feel like I didn't do the best of jobs, but to end up P2 I was happy with. So, let's say, good things and bad things. P2 is still not a bad position to be off the line. And, I mean, I want to be ahead of everyone. That includes my championship contenders and Oscar. So, yeah. Good position for tomorrow and excited for the race. I mean, Sunday is normally our strength. But, yeah, to get past Max, I'm sure it's going to be a big challenge. But we'll wait and see. Their pace was also very strong. If you see the end of the stint, they're doing the same lap times as us. So I don't expect any magical things. And we have some Ferraris behind who I'm sure are going to want to come through as quickly as possible. It's a long race. Many things can happen, and we'll see what we can do. I__l say no just because it was a pretty bad qualifying from my behalf. I think it was the best lap I did in quali by like six tenths or something. So impressive that I managed to improve so much _ or probably impressive that I did such a bad job prior to that. But I think Max has been pretty good all weekend. I think also us as a team since FP1 already, we found that we were not quite in as good of a rhythm and had the pace advantage that we__e had the past few weekends. So of course we wanted P1, but I don__ think we__ be disappointed to take a P2 either. Just I was hitting every kerb possible that I don__ want to hit and just locking up when I shouldn__ lock up. So just not quite in the rhythm. It__ not that I__e not been in the rhythm this weekend. I__e felt like I__e done some reasonable laps so far this weekend and I felt like I had some good strengths here and there, but just couldn__ click back into it come quali, until the final lap. But that__ also the only lap that I need to do it, so I__ happy that I did it in the end. I definitely want to expect that. Everyoneknows that our race pace is probably a bigger strength than our quali pace. We__e proven that many times. But, like Max said, they__e improved a lot from last year. I think coming into the weekend, we probably didn__ expect the Red Bull to be quite as good. But as soon as we did the first few runs, it was clear that they made some good steps compared to last season. So we__l see. His race pace was good on Friday. It wasn__ too dissimilar to ours. So time will tell. The opinion? Terrible, but I had no choice. Everyone__ waiting for us to go out first, really. I knew already last week that I was going to have a bad Q1 because I knew I was going to have to go out the pit lane first, and that was always going to be the expectation. It__ tough because you know it__ never going to be a pole lap, especially without straight line speed, which is quite a long way down on pretty much everyone. It__ impossible to even set a competitive lap. So it__ not the most reassuring thing doing Q1 and doing, like, a 19.5, pretty much, being about five and a half tenths off pole at that point. Not the best feeling inside the car. Especially, in Q3, run two, I knew I had a slipstream, but it__ hard to know how much just the slipstream is going to help me a little bit. I don__ know what it__ like over a whole lap _ maybe three tenths or something. It__ a mixture of having someone pushing some air in front of you. It was still a good lap, easily my best lap that I did. Like I said, I knew last weekend that I was going to be first out on Q3, run one. So it went exactly how I thought it would go. It definitely wasn__ the most comfortable I__e ever been, just because I wasn__ in that rhythm. To try and put in those laps, especially when you lock up in Turn 1, that__ the one place it__ hard. It kind of knocks the confidence the most. My Q2 run_ my run two, first lap one was pretty bad. It was just so close. I think I improved almost a tenth, but it gained me six positions or something. Shows how such a small amount of lap time can help. I was definitely feeling it in both Q3, run two and Q2, run two, lap two. Not the best feeling inside the car at that point. That__ why I__ relatively happy I got into Q3 because I was out for a little while, and then to put it all together for Q3, run two as well. When you look at previous races, even when we__e been incredible in weekends, there have been plenty where Max has beaten us in a fair few races this season. He qualified ahead in many races this season. Even last weekend__ Q3 onboard, it wasn__ like the gaps were huge. Everyone was pretty close. We come to a track, we lose a tenth, he gains a tenth, and that__ all the difference. I wouldn__ say it__ a surprise. The real surprise is compared to last year. But at the same time, when you have a strong team that have won for many years, the drivers and just a strong team in general, you expect them to improve like they__e done from last year and also from their difficulties at the beginning of the season to where they are now. So, not a surprise, but to improve so much from where they were here last year is credit to them.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"I try. But I think around here, with the low downforce, it's always very difficult to nail the lap. On the braking it's easy to make mistakes also. But Q3 felt good. Happy with the laps. And of course, to be on pole here for us is fantastic. The car has been working a lot better the whole weekend. And, yeah, to be able to fight for pole, I'm very happy with that. It was tight. I mean, we were still lacking a tiny amount. We made some final changes, which I think allowed me to push a bit more. And that's exactly what you need in qualifying. So, yeah, for us, it's a great moment. Yeah. Let's see. I mean, historically this season, the race has always been a little bit more complicated for us, but we're going to give it everything we have. I think that's the only thing that we can do. And then we'll see what happens tomorrow. It was good. It's always tough around here. Low downforce, easy to make mistakes on the braking or on entries because you have to commit, but with low downforce, that's not always easy. Also, you know, the closing speeds in certain corners to hit the apex perfectly. But I think that final lap was pretty decent. To get pole here for us is big. It's not always been a good track for us, especially last year was quite a bit of a disaster. So, yeah, this year much better and very happy to be first. I don't know. I mean, it was good. I don't even remember all my quali laps here. Is that a bad thing? I think we had a good start to the weekend, so that was nice. That has been different at times. It still felt like we were lacking something, and then in FP3 it was a little bit better. Still not where I wanted it to be, so then some final tweaks, and that then brought it a bit closer to what I liked. I don__ think the car is ever going to be perfect around here just because of the low downforce feeling anyway. But at least it allowed me to attack corners, have the rotation that I needed at times, and that__ what you want. It__ difficult to say because I didn__ really feel like the improvements were massive between Q1 and Q2. Then you commit a bit more in Q3, but it has a lot of factors that come into play as well with if you have a bit of tow or not. Sometimes you just get lucky as well. This is difficult to say, but at least it was good enough. Difficult to say. I think this season so far, the race pace has not always been great. So I hope that I can do something tomorrow, but I think anyway it__ been a great day for us. We__e been competitive today. We__l try to do the best we can tomorrow, but of course to stay here will be tough, but we__l see what we can do. They are pretty decent in the high speed. They__e quite quick in a straight line. Of course, the low speed, that__ where we lose out compared to the previous generation. And yeah, on some tracks you can do these lap records now. Honestly, I didn__ even think about that when I crossed the line, but it__ nice. It didn__ feel too bad. The cars have been fun. Also, the new tarmac helps around here, kerbing _ like the kerbs opened up a little bit. I think the 2020 Mercedes is still quicker if you would put it on the track now, but it__ been good. At some tracks it__ more fun than others. I think we__e making improvements on the car, but also, setup-wise we found a nicer direction. We still need to understand more why in the race sometimes it doesn__ really translate. I had quite a decent feeling in Zandvoort, but then it was really not good in the race. So I don__ sit here and think that tomorrow is going to be fantastic in terms of how competitive we__e going to be against McLaren. The whole season has shown that yes, sometimes you can be in front in qualifying, but in the race it__ very tough to stay ahead, sometimes on tracks maybe where it__ difficult to pass. Here you can race. I expect it to be a tough battle, but we are making steps forward, and that__ exactly what we want to do. We want to learn a bit more that hopefully also helps us next year. I__ not going to say what I did on the car, but it gave me a better feeling, a bit better balance. Let__ say it like that. Most people do that _ throughout the whole weekend you always fine-tune bits. It__ not like we threw the car around, it__ like tickling things. Honestly, in Q3, my first lap was already pretty decent. There was no big mistake. My improvements were like three or four hundredths here and there. That__ also Monza for you. If you don__ make any big mistakes, there__ not that much lap time left. It__ like maybe hitting an apex a bit better or a kerb. Sometimes you gain two, three hundredths on the straight _ you got lucky. That happens as well. That__ basically what happened in my quali lap.",2025 Italian Grand Prix,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Fernando Alonso,"Let__ see. I think we come to Monza a little bit more cautious about our performance. Last efficiency circuit was Spa, and we were not that fast in Spa. So yeah, we__l see. We made some changes after Spa on the set-up of the car and how we approach the weekends. So hopefully we can be a little bit better. But I think, you know, on paper, it__ not the same track, Monza, as the last two races. I think it is a lot better than at the start of the season. I think my first point in the championship came in race eight or race nine. So yeah, at the beginning we didn__ have a car to be in the top 10 on Sundays. And now it seems that we are able to fight in the midfield and to score points regularly. In the last nine races, I think I__e been seven times in Q3, in the top 10. So definitely there is a very different car now. It is better on the aero platform. We didn__ change much mechanically on the set-up. Yes, we are working a little bit weekend to weekend, but I think aerodynamically the car is a lot more stable, a lot easier to drive, and we can put the laps together. I think we have a couple of places that we think are more similar to Budapest and Zandvoort. Maybe Singapore can be one of those, maybe Brazil. But, you know, we__e been surprised a little bit _ sometimes negatively surprised, sometimes positively _ so we are not really putting all the hopes in one or two races. We will go every weekend to give our maximum, like this one in Monza, even if it seems difficult. And yeah, we__l see in Abu Dhabi how many points and which constructor position we have at the end. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think to trust the tools that we have in the factory and bring things to the track that actually deliver what was expected from them is obviously a very good thing. We didn__ have that in 2023 and in 2024. So yeah, it__ good to go back to a more normal factory-track kind of correlation and develop the 2026 car next winter knowing that the tools are correct. Yeah, definitely, it did change a lot. I think I drove even different configurations of Monza, not only the current one. But yeah, the way the cars changed makes Monza a little bit different than in the past. The way the downforce behaves now is a little bit safer. I remember the first couple of years in Monza, driving with no rear wing basically, made the car feel like it was floating on the straights, and it seemed like you were not totally in control of it. Now I would not say that it__ easy, but the cars are in control all the time. Obviously, now we have different devices that are making this place safer. That__ for me the biggest difference. In the past, when we used to come to Monza, you felt the danger, you felt the speed, you felt the adrenaline. Now it__ a little bit more difficult to feel that thing. We have the Halo, we have the HANS device, we have different things that I didn__ have the first time I drove here. Everyone is doing tests before coming to F1 in Monza, or at least with very low downforce. Back in the 2000s, there were not these kinds of privileges. Yeah, I don__ know. I mean, I will be on the other side _ I will be in front of the TV when that happens. So I don__ know. I don__ think it__ a problem with the sport. So probably it__ not needed to change, but Stefano knows better than anyone. So if he thinks that it__ needed, we are in good hands with him in this kind of decision. But I don__ know. Also, football matches are a little bit long. When I sit in front of the TV, I__ not watching the 90 minutes fully concentrated. I go to the kitchen, come back _ there__ always some moments of distraction, and no one is talking about having 60-minute football matches or something like that. So it__ a problem of society and the kids, but not the sport. So probably it__ not needed, the change. I think, as Kimi said, probably you need to do your own race and you need to find your way into the race to go back to your natural position at the end of the race if you execute it well. If it__ too short, like in some of the Sprint races, if you start with a bad qualifying or whatever, there is not time to execute anything. It__ difficult to follow _ all the cars have the same tyre age, there__ no possibility to recover places. So the longer race gives you that possibility, that freedom on the strategy. But yeah, as I said, it__ a difficult topic. Probably refuelling would be the best thing _ I__e said many times. I know this is totally the opposite direction of how it__ going. But when you can choose your fuel load and have different strategies, that changes completely the way the race unfolds and that creates an incredible, attractive strategy and races. Yeah. I mean, nothing you can do on the external factors. You just need to deliver the job every weekend as they do. They are doing incredibly well. They have a very strong car, but they keep delivering always, even on the difficult weekends. Lando was unlucky in Zandvoort, but still many races to go. So you just focus on winning every weekend if you can. And if you do that, you will be champion. And accepting that sometimes you will be second or third, and try to keep the next one alive. Well, I mean, at that age, you never know what the future will bring. Every driver that we take in aged 14 _ obviously, we try to help as much as we can to follow their dreams. But ultimately, I think you want to be a professional driver. When you are in karting and in junior formulas, you normally have to invest money, and everything is expensive. You need to keep deciding which programme you do the following year depending a little bit on the budget as well. So if we can manage to have drivers that are professional and get paid to perform the job in the future, that's already the first goal. To get to F1, obviously, that__ the dream of all the young drivers. And the problem in Formula 1 is that there are only 22 [seats]. That__ the only filter that you need to go through eventually. But he has the talent. He has been extremely fast in karting, attracted the attention of many Formula 4 teams, and he__ doing very well in single-seaters. So for sure, he__ one of the most promising drivers we have in the academy.",Italy,thursday,Aston Martin
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, it happened a lot of things. I have good memories, but also really bad memories here. But yeah, I mean, it__ a really special place, and I think it__ going to be a special weekend because it__ not just my second home race, but obviously, as you said, this is where it all started with the announcement. So that__ why it__ going to be a very special one. But, you know, it__ been very intense ever since. And yeah, so far, it__ gone quite okay. It__ always tough to say because the cars now are getting closer and closer. But last year, looking at the result, especially in qualifying, they were up there. So this year, it__ been a bit of the trend that the car where it__ been good last year was also quite good this year. So hopefully it__ going to be the same, but we never know. Well, I mean, first of all, it__ a lot lower downforce here, but the first two chicanes are really high braking and then going into a slow corner, similar to Melbourne. But also here you__e got some quick corners such as the Lesmos, Ascari and Parabolica. So in some way, it__ similar to Montreal in terms of characteristics, but the second half of the lap is a bit different. But hopefully _ obviously we__e back on the old suspension, which has given us more confidence _ so hopefully we__l be able to have good pace. For sure. I will be much more prepared, and I definitely know much better what to expect. I know much better how I need to move around, how I need to behave during the race week in order to be able to be 100% every time I go in the car. Just focusing on myself, just focusing on what I have to do. It__ really easy to get lost and focus too much on the final result. Instead, I think it__ much better _ and this I haven__ been doing super well _ but just focusing on the things I have to do: driving well, putting things together, and helping the team the best way to find the best balance as well. So I think that__ the main thing _ just trying to focus on myself and trying to get every detail right. It__ a tough one. I think personally, Sprint weekends are fun because you have a lot of activity. You have to be on point straight away because you have one practice, then qualifying, and then you go into a Sprint race. But I think shorter races _ I don__ think it would really work, because already now with long races, we do one-stop strategy with the tyres we have. They would have to implement so many more rules for a shorter race in terms of pit stops and so on, because I don__ think it would change so much. I think also with the longer race, probably you have more time to build your race. But yeah, I don__ really know. I can__ really give a clear answer on this, but that__ my thought. But Sprint weekends are fun, so that wouldn__ be bad _ having more of them. Well, definitely when I said I__l be more prepared _ obviously, it was my first home race and there was a lot going on, especially outside the track. I think also on my side, I didn__ manage energy the best way, and just going back in the car and not feeling 100%, also focus-wise. So I feel like on that side I will know much better how to react and how to behave. I think that__ going to be the main learning _ also trying to manage the energy the best way possible during the whole weekend. Because, obviously, you start the weekend and then as you go, as you arrive to Sunday, of course you have a bit less energy overall. But the most important is that you arrive with the most amount of energy. I remember being in Imola and already from the Saturday I was pretty tired. So yeah, definitely that was a good learning and I don__ want that to happen again. Well, first of all, I love Greece. I went already a couple of times and I think it__ a really great place to spend summer _ whether with family, with a girlfriend, or with friends. I think it__ really nice, the place, first of all, because it allows you to disconnect and to relax. And the other question _ you kind of expect it a little bit, especially when you__e racing at the peak of the sport. But it__ obviously super nice to see that there are already a lot of fans supporting you. I just try to embrace this as well _ getting the positive energy from them. Of course, sometimes you need to maybe say no, but in that occasion, on holiday, I was happy with that. I was just trying to get the positive energy from them, and it__ always nice to have these kinds of things. I mean, not really. I was already busy with my stuff and with what I did. So I didn__ really have to look at it.
FC: No. I don__ really know. I think he said he wanted a meeting with the stewards after, so we should ask him. We__e not in that meeting, so I don__ know.
FA: Yeah, same. No. I didn__ know anything further. Yeah. For sure. I think in the race I was having good momentum. The pace was strong, and especially on that hard tire I felt pretty well. I was able to catch, lap by lap, the group in front. And then of course, the contact happened, which obviously was not ideal. In the moment I felt like going for it, also because it was probably my only chance. So yeah, just a shame _ obviously it wasn__ me. But of course it__ always nice to have a back-to-back race because, despite what happened, I can still carry this momentum into this race weekend, especially after seeing that the pace overall was better. So hopefully we can keep working, keep improving, and then deliver a great result this weekend. I think yeah. I mean, it obviously depends on the track. If it__ a new track, it__ a bit tougher for rookies because they have to get up to speed _ like we had to do in a couple of occasions this year, such as China, Miami, and Austin as well with Sprint. So sometimes it__ tough. But if you have the confidence, you__e able to build up into the session and find your rhythm pretty quick. Compared to more experienced drivers, it can be a bit of a disadvantage because you don__ know the detail of the track, where you can make most of the time and where you can lose the most. But overall, if you__e able to get up to speed quickly, and especially if you have the confidence, you can still deliver a good result even with one practice.
FC: I think we are used to two weekends _ it's very short, very small amount of laps before quali _ and you need to be very quick on top of it. It__ always tricky when you don__ know the track. I had that last year. I think Austin and Qatar were Sprints. I didn__ know the track, so it__ tricky, but I still had a good result there in Sprint Quali in Austin. So it__ not _ I think if you prep well nowadays, the simulator also helps a lot. So yeah, if you can be on top of it and do a good prep, it really helps. We are used to not having a lot of laps in practice, so it__ not too bad, I think.",Italy,thursday,Mercedes
Franco Colapinto,"Yeah, it__ the first track I actually raced in last year. So from now on, we__e got another nine races that I know _ races that I__e already been in _ which is always very helpful. But just very nice memories. Being back here in Monza after a year of my debut, it does bring a lot of flashbacks and memories back, which is always very nice. To win that surprise call last year, that I was jumping in this weekend, was a dream coming true, and a lot of things happened from there. So yeah, it__ really nice to be back here in Monza. It__ a track that I always like and I really enjoy driving in. It__ full of Tifosi, very passionate people and fans that support us, and it__ a great track to race. So yeah, can__ wait for it. Yeah. I feel much more in control, starting to be just more confident with the car, and I__ gaining that feeling that I had last year very quickly. I didn__ have it this year so early on, and I think now the team, my engineers, really helped me to win that back a little bit. We are still working on it really hard because it__ not where we want to be. We are doing a lot of progress with the car, but I think generally it__ been much better. The last two races have been more competitive. We showed that we__e very close to the points. So still a lot of work to be done. This track, it can be quite hard for us with the long straights, but I think if we do well and we take all the opportunities available, we can have a good weekend. Yeah, I think they are just doing a great job. Stefano did a great job in bringing the sport to where it is now. He__ a great leader, and I really appreciate the effort that everyone is doing to try to make it better for the fans, for everyone here. It__ getting bigger and bigger, Formula 1. If it__ from someone, it__ thanks to them and the effort. I can__ comment too much on that _ there are a lot of new things happening in the sport and they are bringing a lot of new people to it. I think we are all very grateful for the effort they have been doing in the past to make the sport better and to bring it to where it is now. I just enjoy driving. So if we keep driving and keep doing a lot of laps, I__ happy with that. It doesn__ really matter what session it is. Yeah, I think that one year ago everything was new, and everything was tricky to get used to it so quickly. Now I__e got a lot more experience, a lot more time. I think that step of suddenly having to work with 20 engineers, or 30 engineers, in the factory _ and in F2 you only had one person really to talk to and get all that information out. Here, it is a really big team. It__ a lot of people putting a lot of effort to make that car go quick. It's more than a thousand people in the factory making that car to put it out on track. And I think that__ the best thing I__e learned _ to work well with everyone and with the team, and to understand that for it to go well, it needs to be really strong from the base. And I think working with the team constantly really brings a big help to make the car go quick and do what you want it to do. That__ really important. Yeah. I think it was a really good weekend. In general, I was really happy with how it went. We did find a lot of performance, and in the race I think we did a good job on the strategy. The team did a good job as well. I think everything was very clear. We did swap positions and everything was good on that. We were just very close to the points, and it was a bit of a pity we didn__ score, but I__ sure it will come soon.",Italy,thursday,Alpine
Lewis Hamilton,"Well, good afternoon, everyone. Yeah, yesterday was such a unique experience. I think already from yesterday morning, I got to Maranello. And when you walk in and then see the Ferrari logo, I still have to pinch myself. It__ really so unique. There are people outside the factory always. I__e never seen fans outside of a factory before in any of my years, and you see that every single time. There__ just such a positive energy, clearly so much love for this brand and what it means to people. To be in Milan, really in the heart of it all yesterday and seeing the fans and just how passionate they were_ wow. It was intense but very, very positive. I really tried to harness all that good energy that they gave us. Honestly, I haven__, simply because I__e been on the podium plenty of times here, so I know what it__ like to be up there. I__e seen how it__ been for other Ferrari drivers, and anything I try to imagine will be far from what that feeling could be. But always, just coming here for anyone, no matter what team you drive for, it__ an incredible experience. Being in this park, at this historic circuit, and then seeing the whole Tifosi throughout the pit straight. But also when you do the parade lap, the fans are very close, so it feels like they__e right with you in the car. It__ pretty cool. I don__ know. I mean, I__ still obviously in my first year with the team, and so every weekend is the first time driving this car at that track. The approach is different from my previous experiences. When you go to different places, the set-up__ different. So it__ always new, which I__ enjoying at the moment. I think Ferrari__ journey has gone pretty well in the past years. Obviously, they won here last year with a great strategy and a great drive from Charles. I__ really keen to see how the car works here. We__e definitely learning from weekend to weekend, loads of positives to take from the last, so I think we just have to keep building on that. Well, firstly, I have so much love for Niki. But Niki didn__ convince me to join Mercedes. It was more Ross, really, back then. When we sat together in my mum__ kitchen, he told me where the team was going and what they were doing. Niki was definitely a part of it, but it was mostly that meeting that really pulled me in. Niki and I had an amazing relationship. When I joined Ferrari, I hadn__ even thought of Niki having driven at Ferrari. It was literally just because, as a kid, I watched Michael and was a big fan of the team. I always looked at the reaction from the crowd every time Ferrari was on the podium _ the passion was like no other team. I wanted to feel what that was like.
Now having joined the team and learning more about the history, it__ amazing this weekend, because I got to celebrate Niki at Mercedes, I got to celebrate winning championships with him, and now to be able to come to Ferrari and celebrate him here too. His legacy continues to live on. I know what he would be saying to me nowadays, and he__ always in the back of my mind that thought. When I didn__ do well, he would do this and he__ tell me to __ive them hell_ _ but he would always say the word __rseholes_! I never understood it at first. I__ say __hat do you mean? Do you mean give them hell?_ and he would say no __ive them arseholes!_. But he was just such a fighter. Of course. I don__ know how the other drivers felt about the decisions from the last race, but when I landed back home and saw I got this penalty, I was really shocked. But it is what it is. It__ obviously not black and white. If you look at the report, I did lift, but to their liking, not enough. To get the penalty and penalty points is pretty hardcore. But I learn from it. There__ no point whinging about it. I__l move forward. It__ going to be challenging this weekend. Qualifying is already so close between us all. Just getting into Q3 is tough, getting into the top five is very tough. And then on top of that, to be set back five places is not great when you__e going into your first Monza GP with Ferrari. But it gives me more to fight for, and I__ very motivated to make up those places regardless. Definitely in the race. Throughout the weekend, the approach we had was spot on. I felt it was one of our strongest, if not the strongest, and smoothest weekends up until Sunday. Sunday was disappointing and unfortunate, not the result we want. It__ unusual for me because I don__ really make a lot of mistakes in races like that. The great thing is the team remained really positive, incredibly supportive every weekend. They lift your spirits. Then in the following days, they deep-dived into trying to understand what led to it. It wasn__ a lack of concentration. There were several things that contributed: for example, we had a downgraded upshift, which locked the rear wheels and spat the rear end out. Also, it was spitting and so I was maybe 10 millimetres or 10 centimetres wider than the previous lap. So a combination of things. Either way, it__ not great, but I learn from it and move forward. If I apply that same approach this weekend and the following races, I feel positive about the direction we__e going. Yeah. But I think it was a different island, maybe next to each other. I wish I knew so we could have met up. Greece is beautiful. In my past few summers, I like to go to places that are not so busy. Obviously, I went to a relatively busy part of Greece, which is Mykonos, which is definitely way too busy for me. But as I started to travel further south to some of the other islands, it__ breathtaking. It__ definitely my new favourite place to go. At the end of my trip, I was discovering new places, and I was like, I wish I came here first. There__ still a lot more for me to see. I loved how private it was. The culture looks really beautiful, the buildings, the little towns, and the food is incredible. I can__ wait till next summer to go back. Yeah. It__ been an emotional roller coaster. Did I expect it to be as volatile in terms of feeling? No. But that__ life. Even though we had a difficult Sunday, we__e coming out on the brighter end of the tunnel. I read something recently saying there__ no point stressing about tomorrow because it often puts shade on the present. So I__ really trying not to worry about tomorrow. I__ trying to be present and enjoy every moment because this half of the season has gone by really quick. It__ my first half a season with this team, and there__ obviously a long way to go. I don__ want to miss any of these special moments. For example, yesterday, my first Monza in Ferrari red. When I leave the garage tomorrow, it__ going to be incredibly special coming onto this circuit. I reflect on when I was a kid watching Michael winning here. Now I get to have that experience of being on the receiving end of the Tifosi. I want to give them absolutely everything this weekend to get the best result for them because the passion and the support they__e given me and this team is like nothing I__e ever seen. A tow? Yeah. For pole, let__ say? No. I know that Ferrari used to do it many years ago. I remember when I started at least, I noticed Kimi and Felipe used to do that often. I__e never really_ it can be beneficial, but in my past it felt like there was more risk, and often one person had to be sacrificed for it. So I__ not sure whether they will do that this weekend. It__ not been discussed.
But if it meant getting Charles there, then I would be happy to play that role. I don__ remember every single season, to be honest, so I don__ really want to compare it to others. I__ sure there have been plenty of seasons that have felt difficult. I remember 2009 was difficult. I remember 2010, 2011 wasn__ great. 2012 was a pivotal moment for me. Obviously 2022, 2023. So there__ been plenty of others that were just different. I was in a different place in my life. This one, really living the dream, moving to race with Ferrari. Of course, I had the whole of last year to think about it and try to prepare, but there are still things you couldn__ foresee. There__ been a lot of adjustment both from my side and the team__ side. They__e really moved heaven and earth to accommodate me. Obviously, there are cultural differences. Fred made a comment that perhaps they underestimated me joining the team and the year we__e been faced with in terms of the problems with the car. So yeah, a combination of all those things. But honestly, the harder it is, the better it can make you. This year has been tough for everyone in the team, but it prepares us for better days. We__l be stronger having gone through this tough first six months. I__ really excited and motivated for a positive uphill battle from here, and I feel like I__e got the best people around me to do that.",Italy,thursday,Ferrari
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah. Good afternoon. I think I had progress since day one of being in this car. I wouldn__ say the first few races it showed in the results, but at least in how I felt. I was fully convinced I was in the right direction, just step by step. Jumping into the middle of the season is not easy. A lot of things changed also within the Red Bull team as well. So I gave my all every race. But I knew, especially in the last few races, it__ been getting closer and closer. It__ all about putting it all together, especially as the whole field is very, very tight. Every millisecond from Q1, Q2, Q3 counts a lot. It__ a race [Zandvoort], I was able to put it all together. One of the best weekends I had in terms of progress and the quality throughout the weekend. It was not easy with the safety cars and everything, but I was able to squeeze out points, which I__ pretty happy with. I mean, I reset every year. Although, like you said, three out of four times I had DNFs with a lot of troubles. So I hope I don__ have that this year. I still enjoy this track a lot. Very challenging in terms of confidence. When you have confidence, you know you can do a quick lap, and also for the race it__ quite a raceable track compared to others. So yeah, I__ still looking forward to it. Yeah. That__ what I__ trying to do every race. You always need results as much as possible. I try to exceed expectations and just keep doing what I__ doing. I don__ think I have to change much. Since Laurent joined, actually, my results haven__ been too bad. Obviously, whether it__ enough or not, that__ not for me to decide. But I just keep pushing. Well, yeah, I didn__ know also that Lewis was at the other side of the island, next to each other. Same, like, you know, you want the beach, the seas are always beautiful. The food is incredibly fresh, especially the seafood. I enjoyed it a lot, especially for training as well. It__ consistently nice weather, and it__ warm, but at the same time you feel some nice breeze consistently. For me it__ the best place to do that. And most of the islands are not that big, so if you do cycling you can do a whole loop and see most of the places from that island. Yeah, it__ really cool.",Italy,thursday,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it__ a track that I love coming to. I think it__ one of the best racetracks in the world. Having all the Tifosi there makes it more enjoyable. I just do well here for some reason. Maybe the big brakings or just feeling the car a bit more loose, with a low downforce package, I always feel more comfortable. It looks like it__ been a good track for Williams in the past, so hopefully we can get a good result. Well, it just completely depends on the type of corner. We have a car that does very well in straight line braking and 90-degree corners. We don__ like spending too much time in a combined situations of entry and exit. We struggle very much with through-corner balance limitation, which hurts us in long corners. Even though at this track we should be better, there__ still Parabolica or Lesmo 1 where, compared to the competition, we__e going to be down. Those are pretty important corners. But even like that, we believe we can still do good lap times in the straights and in tight short corners like Turn 1_2, Turn 3_4. We have good ride, we have good braking capacity. So yeah, it__ an interesting car. I__ discovering a lot of new things this year, having to adapt my driving style a lot to different limitations that I wasn__ used to in the past. It__ a process I__ enjoying, but also one that is making me more complete as a driver. Maybe it__ not the nicest car to drive in some areas, but it definitely has very good qualities in others, and you just need to know how to maximise them. Not recently. No. We were just going for normal train tows, no specific teammate strategy. Yeah. I did get the chance to go and speak to them after the race. There was a misunderstanding while I was in the TV pen where I thought I would not be able to go. But in the end, I had the opportunity to go and sit with them for 15 minutes to analyse the incident. It was very clear to me that as soon as they got all the evidence right and they looked at the places they needed to take the right decision, it was clear to me that I think they realised probably the decision taken wasn__ the best one. Now we are trying to see if we can come up with enough evidence to change the outcome of the penalty, because I still firmly believe it was a very poor penalty I received and a bad judgment, which can happen as long as you have the capacity to revisit it. If there__ been a misunderstanding or a lack of evidence or analysis, then there is still time to reanalyse it, reopen it, and change it. I do believe they had a very difficult Sunday looking back at it. They had a very busy afternoon, and maybe it was overwhelming because of the amount of stuff that happened in the race. But I still firmly believe what I thought after the race. Now in a cooler-headed state, I still believe the penalty was not acceptable, and I made it very clear. It__ very tough. I keep, especially after the race, trying to do my best to control my emotions. But there are moments where it__ very difficult to control them and it__ very difficult to understand certain things. I__e always said it, and I will always support the idea, that in F1 we should have fixed stewards. The regulations are already incredibly complex, it would be very useful to always have the same people judging and applying them, because then you know what you__e dealing with. My belief is that__ the way forward. I__ not speaking for the GPDA or anyone here. That__ my individual belief. I think they have an incredibly difficult job, and sometimes they also have restricted time. I think what happened in my case in Zandvoort was a consequence of trying to rush a decision without looking deep enough in the analysis. If you just apply the rule in the rulebook, you could understand why they would want to penalise me. The moment you analyse the onboard footage and go into detail, you can clearly see why I should have never got a penalty. But the opposite can be applied for the incident Lewis. Maybe in the Lewis incident, the decision process took too long, and he__ now having to suffer a penalty in Monza when he did nothing wrong here. He had half an hour during the race to pay a penalty for his infringement. That shows how difficult the process is, how difficult everything is to handle, and why there__ always improvements to be made and it needs to be a collaboration between drivers, FIA, GPDA, to try and find better solutions. Zandvoort exposed why we are not at the right level yet for such a difficult but incredible sport to watch.",Italy,thursday,Williams
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it wasn't easy. I gave it everything at the start to move forward. Little moment in Turn 2. But yeah, after that, we just had to do our own race. Unfortunately, we didn't have the pace of the McLarens. We got a bit lucky, of course, with one retiring, but in general, to be on the podium here is a great result. So to be in second, I think is a really, really good achievement for us. Yeah, I tried to send it into Turn 3, but unfortunately there was too much sand in Turn 2 from the middle of the track to the outside. I knew that we had the softer compound, so I tried to make it work on that first lap. Yeah. I mean, we take it. Qualifying was good. I hoped for a little bit more today, but quite quickly I realized the pace was not there. It always seems like in the race we just struggle more than over one lap with the tyre behaviour, with the car, and that was very obvious again today. So, I just tried to manage my pace, but that basically meant it was more of a fight with the cars behind me than whatever was happening in front of me. Yeah, that for me felt the best after Friday. So that was planned. And of course, with the Safety Cars everyone has to box again to take fresh tyres. But yeah, it was all according to plan. The start was alright, to be honest. Then I tried to go around the outside in Turn 1. Then into Turn 2, but there__ always a lot of sand in that corner from the middle of the track to the edge. With the soft compound I just still pushed the entry and then went a bit sideways heading into Turn 3, but it was all okay. Not at all. But I still wanted to have a bit of fun out there. When I got ahead, I just followed my pace and that meant at one point Lando got ahead again. You could see, I mean, it__ a different league. There__ no point trying to ruin your own race defending really hard or losing two, three laps defending for your life. Unfortunately, there__ no point in that. Yeah, it__ fantastic. Honestly, coming in as a rookie is not easy with these cars. For him to be on the podium here is fully deserved. I think he had a great weekend, but also drove a great race. And of course, also for the team, I think the whole season already they have been on it. And Isack is then finishing the job and that__ just fantastic to see. Terrible. I__ joking. I mean, it__ out of your control. So, you just need to keep working hard, keep trying to win. As simple as that. Especially when you are team-mates, you have the same car, same opportunities. It__ probably a little bit more complicated than when it__ two different teams, but still a lot of races and you can see things can swing. Like Oscar said, you don__ know if you get a mechanical failure or not, it__ out of your control. So yes, it__ not ideal, but there are enough races to either turn it around or not, and time will tell.",Netherlands,post-race,Red Bull
Isack Hadjar,"Yeah, it feels a bit unreal. What was most surprising to me is keeping that fourth place for the whole race. Unfortunately for Lando, we took advantage of his [sic] puncture, but yeah, we did no mistake. The car was on rails the whole weekend, and I'm really happy about myself because I really maximised what I had. Made no mistakes and brought home the podium. So yeah, I'm so happy for my guys. Yeah. That was always the target since I was a kid. So, this is a first step, my first podium, and hopefully many more to come. Yep. I mean, outstanding day. I did not expect that waking up this morning. I was being very realistic. I knew there was George behind me and both Ferraris. Also didn__ run on Friday, any long run, so I didn__ have a clue. So, to cross the line third is just unreal. Yeah, it was very tricky. Thankfully I had an okay start to keep fourth and from there, on the opening laps, I knew Charles would be trying to go for the move, which he did. I was really comfortable on the brakes, made sure I defended the right way and that__ what we did. Once I was holding him for a while, I realised that we had the car pace to fight for big points. Towards the end of the race I thought if anything happens at the front, actually I__ on a podium finish position, and that__ what happened. There__ more than one person, obviously. First of all, my parents, my mum and my dad. And more sporting wise, Helmut who gave me this shot. I remember four years ago he signed me back in FRECA it was and he gave me a path, a trajectory, and I__ actually following it pretty well right now. It__ going to be tricky considering the very long straight line. But we can always be a bit surprised, and let__ hope for a good result. Historically they had good car pace around here. Pierre won a few years ago, so they always bring back good memories. Yeah. Everyone can have one. I__ being generous today. And yeah, after what happened in Australia, in the car, obviously, I thought my life was over, but then you realise it can happen and you bounce back very quickly from that. Then to have a podium without too much miracles and not much going on ahead__o, I didn__ expect it, especially that fast in the season. Already finishing fourth on pure pace would have been a mighty result. But finishing third, I__ just over the moon. I don__ want to be next to Max. I don__ like him. That__ it. Yeah, it feels great. Max is someone I__e been looking up to since my junior days. The last five years have been outstanding. To share the track, spend most of the race behind him, being within two or three seconds the whole time, and share my first podium with him on his home soil as well, I think it__ pretty cool. No. As I said, I was being realistic and was honestly aiming for big points. That was the target. I knew it would be very hard to fight Ferrari and Mercedes. But it was more like towards the last 20 laps I thought if anything happens at the front, then I__ on a podium position. And when Lando had the issue, I knew I was going to finish there.",Netherlands,post-race,RB
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it feels good, obviously. I feel like it's a pretty hard act to follow Isack standing up here, so I'll try my best. But yeah, I controlled the race when I needed to and obviously it was incredibly unfortunate for Lando at the end, but I felt like I was in control of that one and just used the pace when I needed to. It was a bit of a different race to 12 months ago. So very happy with all the work we've done to try and improve around here and very satisfied to come out on top. Nothing special. Just trying to improve everywhere we can. The start of this weekend was looking like a difficult one and managed to get it together in qualifying. I was happy with the pace I had today. Very, very happy. Obviously, a couple of safety cars spiced it up a little bit, and we weathered it all. So, I'm very proud of the whole team. It wasn't just myself that improved to get here. It was the whole team around me and without them, none of this is possible. So, it's a big team effort. Yep. Starting out on top is a good way to go. If we can keep it running then that__ be great. But there's a long way to go yet and we__l keep doing it one race at a time. Yes, I am. Yep. I__e got lollie stuck in my teeth now, so_ It__ already the best press conference ever, we__e got food! It was a really good race. Felt like I was in control the whole time. Obviously, the restarts are always tough moments to get right, but I felt in control. Obviously, the ending was unfortunate for Lando and the team to not have a one-two when I think we really deserved it. But from my side, very proud of the week we put together, being quick when it mattered. So very happy. Very. I think qualifying was the key this weekend. Through the free practice sessions, it was looking like a difficult Zandvoort again, but we chipped away, tried to find time, tweak the car here and there, but just tried to really improve how I was driving because, let__ be honest, it__ pretty hard to complain about the car we__e got. So just tried to chip away with that and it came good when it mattered. And through the race today, I felt like I had good pace as well and used that when I needed to. So massively proud of firstly myself, but also the whole team around me in turning it around from 12 months ago. Yeah. I mean, it wasn__ the best start I__e ever had and had to cover the inside. Obviously, I knew Max was on softs and was keeping an eye on him. And then going through Turn 2 and into Turn 3 I saw Max very sideways in my mirrors. I was just hoping that he wasn__ going to run into the side of me, but it worked out fine. From then on, I could bring the tyres in and control it. And then I was pretty happy. Not really. I mean, the first one worked very well, but then the next two, you don__ have many options left to you. I think the longer you leave it, especially once you get into the pit straight, everyone knows you__e going to go sooner or later. So, I was just trying to change it up as much as I could. Didn__ work that well on the last two, but it was just enough. That was probably the hardest part, but I think we managed it well. No, I don__ think so. There__ still a long way to go. I need to keep pushing and trying to win races still. I wouldn__ say it__ a very comfortable margin. As we saw today, it can change with one DNF very, very quickly. So this far out from the end of the year, it__ not a comfortable gap. Yeah. It__ happened a few times this year where it started a bit slow and then gotten better as the weekend__ gone on. The difference from this year to last year is last year, those weekends that started slow, the middle was slow, and the end was slow. I think it__ just been good to actually find the time as the weekend__ gone on. Is it an ideal way? Am I doing it on purpose? Not always. I__ trying to build up to things, of course, but was hoping to build up a bit quicker than I did this weekend. I got there just in the end in Q3, but I didn__ go into qualifying the most optimistic. So maybe a little bit slow to get there, but I felt very happy with where I was going into qualifying, not expecting the world, just trying to do my best and see what happened. And in the end that was enough, and a similar thing today. Very happy from that side of things, and I think that part is probably the __scar-like weekend_. Yeah. He__ been very helpful through my whole career, certainly the last five years. I think once I got into Formula 1, that__ where his help has really been a lot greater and more clear. Before I got to F1 it was more in the background, helping with making the right decisions and bits of advice here and there. When I got to F1, he knew how it works and thinking of or asking questions that hadn__ even come into my head. Helping me set expectations and prepare me for how tough it__ going to be and how big of a step it is. That side of things he has been very helpful with, and that hasn__ changed in the last three years. There__ still been progress to make, things to improve, and I__ still gaining experience even now. Still not perfect, always thinking of new things, things I wasn__ thinking of last year or the year before. So, it__ important having him by my side. The relationship between Lando and I has not changed. If anything, we know each other better now and actually probably get on better than before. Anytime you get mentioned in the same sentence as Michael Schumacher, that__ a good thing. I__e got a hell of a long way to go to be talked about in the same air as someone like him, but I__l take it.",Netherlands,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, for sure. I mean, this weekend so far was quite tricky for us, but Qualifying was basically the best I__e felt all weekend. So that__ exactly what you want. To be honest, to be P3 here, I__ very happy with that. I mean, the energy of the crowd, of course, the whole weekend already has been amazing, and to see so much orange on the grandstand, it__ always very special. It__ all what I like. So, I__ happy to be here. Yeah, let__ see what we can do. I mean, the McLarens have been very fast all weekend, so it__ also important to just focus on our own race, see what we can do. But this has been a good step forward. I hope that we can keep that up also going into the race tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, so far this weekend, we__e been struggling for grip and general balance. Luckily in Qualifying it was the best that I__e felt all weekend. That__, of course, what you like. It all just felt a bit more normal, a bit more together. Still not on the level of McLaren, of course, but at least to be P3 is very good for us. So, we did the right things in terms of setup directions. I__ very happy with that. It just made it a bit more fun _ you had to push to the limit around here, which has some incredible layouts. Changed a lot. Even this morning it was still not good. So, then we changed other bits again and that made it feel a bit better. But it__ still quite tricky with the wind. It__ been very windy today and some corners you__e a bit guided by what the wind is doing. So, the car is pushing or sliding, and I guess we__e not the strongest at the moment, but still it was not bad. It__ a bit unknown, but I do think that what we have on the car should be more stable. But this season in general, our race pace has not been the best in terms of if you compare it to a Qualifying lap. But I just hope that at least we can keep the guys behind us literally behind us in the race. What happens in front of me, I have no control over. I__l just try to do the best I can from my side. Yeah. I mean, I__e said it before _ we do some driving on the simulator. I think I even shared with him the track model that I use for Zandvoort. So, I__ sure that he did quite a lot of laps. And, yeah, we naturally always speak about things and tricks and what to do in F1 because I don__ think he had driven here before in F1. So yeah, he__ a great guy, and we get along very well. And I think, again today, he had a very good Qualifying himself. So, I guess what he__ doing is working well. Yeah, I think it__ fine _ speed limit. It__ always better if it can spice up maybe a bit more the strategy. Otherwise, you want to stick to a one-stop. Maybe this opens the opportunity for a two-stop for some drivers. So, I guess that__ a good thing. Okay. Who was on pole? No. I know him. I couldn__ care less. It__ not my problem.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yes and no. I mean, it__ close. It__ been close the whole weekend. So, easily could go one way or the other. I guess a little bit disappointed I__ not on pole, but it__ close. Still some decent laps, so not the end of the world either. No. I mean, with the wind like this, a lot of it__ down to luck as well, you know _ even with all the luck I__e been having. It__ tough. I had a good lap, like Q3 run one, but it__ a smaller headwind down the straight and I lost like one hundredth. So, you could easily say it__ there. But I__ in a good position. We__e in a good fight. Oscar__ been driving well, we__e been driving well all season, so we__l have some fun tomorrow. Yeah. I mean, we both had terrible starts last year, so we__l see. I don__ think the the inside is a lot better, but it__ a long race, a lot of laps, and we__l see what the weather holds for us too. I mean, both felt pretty good. It feels quick around here, first of all, so I__e been feeling pretty good the whole weekend, always in a good flow around here, which is important. Both my laps were good. I don__ think many people improved on their second runs, so I don__ know if the track got a little bit trickier or slower in the second run, but both were pretty close, I think. Again, within half a tenth or a tenth of pole position. So, yeah, tricky also with the wind. It can easily just favour you or not favour you. And yeah, one-hundredth is pretty minimal. Even coming out of the last corner, I__ a little bit up and I lose like two-hundredths by the time I get to the start-finish line and that__ pole position gone for me. No, there__ not too much to complain about. I think there were a couple of places where I wasn__ quite on a good enough limit and consistently losing a little bit too much lap time today and this weekend. So, some places and things I need to work on, but otherwise the laps were good, and I was still pretty happy. No idea, but it__ a softer tyre. I don__ know if the wind changes that. The wind always changes some things. We also have a much quicker car. So, I guess just everywhere. I would have loved to be on pole. I think that__ the thing that would have made me the happiest. But it__ been close all weekend. You just look at the results and I__e been ahead. But I easily could have been behind by just losing half a tenth or a tenth here and there. So, it__ not like I__e dominated it. I__e just been ever so slightly ahead and it__ just switched the other way around for quali. But I still am confident for the race pace. We know that__ one of our strengths as a team. But I also know my main competitor is the guy ahead of me. We__l see tonight. Of course, we always put the plan together, but with the other side and with Oscar and everything. So, it__ always a little bit trickier to beat that one guy. But at the same time, it__ a long race. We__l see what we can do. I mean, yeah _ no offence to Max _ he was in a much slower car last year. So that helps a lot. Oscar__ in a much quicker car this year and the hardest guy to normally overtake is your team mate, especially when in a quali like today where we were split by one hundredth. So yeah, I mean, it__ going to take some magic, some good strategy or incredible tyre saving or something. But it__ normally pretty difficult to overtake in the first place. It__ even harder to do that behind your team mate. So, I__l see what I can dream of tonight. Oh, nothing to add. I don__ care.",Netherlands,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. That was the definition of peaking at the right time. I think the whole weekend I__e felt pretty good, but it__ just been a couple of corners that I__e not been able to go any faster. I didn__ really go any faster in those corners, but I found some more elsewhere! So, yeah, super happy to come out with the result. Obviously, you__e still got all the points tomorrow, but yeah, it was looking like a little bit of a tricky weekend so far, so to come out with that, I__ pretty stoked. You just keep chipping away and that__ one of the nice things about having this much practice _ you__e got time to work on it. Like I said, I think I just improved the parts where I was already not bad and made up the difference that way. Still some things to try and improve and work on, but overall, very happy. Let__ see what we get tomorrow. Obviously, we__e both trying to beat each other every weekend. So, there__ a few variables in there that you can mix up. Let__ see what happens tomorrow. It felt pretty good. You know, not perfect, but I think with the wind being so strong, there are some places that are never going feel perfect. So, it felt good and a good improvement from pretty much every other lap I did this weekend. So, it was nice to be able to pull it out then. But yeah, it took a lot of hard work, some patience in trying to find the time, and eventually I got there. You know, little tweaks here and there, but I think just trying to _ I think in Qualifying when you get a few more goes at it, a few more sets, naturally it__ a little bit easier to find a little bit more. Obviously, the pressure is much higher than practice. But yeah, just felt like this weekend took a lot of attempts to try and improve in some places and eventually it was just enough attempts. So yeah, just trying to drive faster, essentially. Yeah, definitely. But I knew that from FP1. I think the pace this weekend has been very strong. FP3 seemed very, very strong and I knew that the car wasn__ the problem. It was just that it was taking me a while to improve in some places. So, yeah, the team__ done a great job in firstly putting the car in a good place for me and also helping me improve myself. I don__ know yet. The tyre strategies from everyone are a bit different. I think us two are one of the only teams to have two Hards and a Medium. I think pretty much everyone else has just one Hard and one Medium. So, we__e got that kind of up our sleeve, but it also kind of tells you a little bit of what most people are thinking, I guess. So, we__l wait and see, but we__e got some options available. Yes and no. It__ changed a little bit through the weekend. Yesterday, I feel like I made progress in FP2, but then FP3 not so much. Then the wind changed a little bit overnight. So, some of the corners where I was stronger yesterday became a bit weaker again, and it__ kind of moved around a little bit. Yeah, the middle sector__ not been my favourite this weekend, but I think eventually I got there. Just putting it all together in the same lap was not that easy. So, I feel like I__e improved generally from last year, but clearly, I think Qualifying has gone much better. And also, this is kind of the first normal Saturday we__e had in Zandvoort. The last two years we raced here, it__ been a wet FP3 or a wet start of Qualifying. Today I was able to get more into a rhythm, and I think that helped as well. I think it does slightly help mix up strategies potentially. We__l see tomorrow. But it does feel like a tight pit lane here. I think for some reason it feels tighter than it is because when we raised it with the FIA, actually in terms of numbers and the gaps between boxes, it__ not the worst of the year. So, I think it__ fine. It__ probably a little bit on the limit, but I think it will more mix up the racing, and it__ fine from a safety standpoint. I think my incident with George yesterday wasn__ to do with the speed limit, really. It was just some confusion in our box. So, I think it__ fine. I__e got to take a wild guess. Was it Niki Lauda that won the race? It was! I don__ think it was Niki on pole. You know him? Okay, that makes it easy. Nelson Piquet. Fair. And you wanted second and third?",Netherlands,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Just try to make the best of it. Every single race we can try to see if there are opportunities and try to learn more about the car. Of course, next year will be very different with the car, but I'm still very curious also to understand the current car a bit more and where we can find a bit more performance to make it a bit easier for ourselves. No. Not really. I would hope so! That was not a great weekend for us, so I hope that we can be closer. I don't think this is going to be our best track in the remainder of the calendar, but then again, there might be some weather coming in as well. So that always creates a bit of chaos, so we just need to see what happens. I would say, naturally, the more higher-speed corners in a layout should be a bit better for us. The low speed, medium speed is probably a little bit more difficult. Yeah. I mean, when I saw the news come out, I sent a message to him. I'm, of course, very happy for him that he got a seat. He's a great guy, and we always got along very well. So, yeah, I'm happy to see him back on the grid. How he's going to perform will also depend on how good the car is going to be. It's a bit difficult to say at the moment, but it's a new opportunity and I'm sure he's very excited for it. Low line is not possible. The apex basically is too flat. They should have banked that as well, then it gives you an opportunity, but they didn't. Try, yeah. Just send it in. Four cars. Just don't hit me. It's always so difficult to say. I know Alex already from go-karting times, and I think what he is achieving in IndyCar is incredible. It's so impressive to see, but it's impossible to know how people will do in F1 and it__ the same question the other way round _ how would you do in Indycar? You have no idea. So, for me, it__ a bit of a waste of time to try to debate that. I__ just so happy to see doing so well in IndyCar and the way he's been dominating. Yeah. I mean, of course he joined quickly and then had two weeks, and then you had a break again. So, it's not suddenly that a lot of things are changing. But I like the approach that he's having. And it seems like everyone is very positive about the mood in the team, also, when I see people walk around and when we__e talking. So, yeah, we just need to keep that going. It's not like, when you put someone in charge, that in two weeks or two months things can drastically change. It takes time. Yeah. Definitely brings a smile on my face, when I__ driving or even driving out of the pit box. Seeing that amount of orange always is very special. For sure, it's not only about the driving _ it's quite a bit of a party going on those three days. So_ Unfortunately, not for me. But, yeah, they always seem to have a great time, and I think that's also very important when you come to a Grand Prix. It's not that hard, to be honest. There will be a time that it won__ happen. Unfortunately, that is a bit the case at the moment. But it doesn__ make sense for me to be frustrated or be screaming about it, because it's just a waste of energy. That__ not what I'm doing. I think we just need to look at the car and the operation and how we can move forward in the future and be better. That__ what we are doing currently. I can__ really recall that, to be honest. From my side, it didn__ feel like that. So, I can't really say anything more about it because, for me, it didn__ feel like that or it didn__ happen that way. Yeah. I remember being there in Adria, because some of my friends were driving. And I knew, of course, the factory team of CRG was there. They__e done so much for me in the past, so I quickly just went there to say hello to the boss, Giancarlo. And then I saw a very tiny Brazilian rocking up asking for a picture. So, yeah. And we still laugh about it now. Sometimes the picture gets sent, and it__ nice to see. And then, of course, seeing Gabi here now in Formula 1. Yeah. As long as we don__ add another street circuit, then I__ happy. Of course, it__ a shame, but what can you do about it? I__ already very proud that I__e had a home Grand Prix for a few years. We__e just going to make the best out of it, enjoy it a bit more. Even when F1 is not here, it__ still a great track to drive in any car. So, for sure, I__l be back. But yeah, let__ see. I have no idea how the calendar will look in two years' time. So, we__l have to wait and see. Yeah. No, F1 cars are fun. Some are a bit more fun than others. The faster they go, the more fun. But there are also other cars outside of Formula 1 that are fun _ but in a different way. For me, in general, on a weekend like this, the most fun that I have is normally in the car. Hagelslag. Yeah. I mean, for me, I think how the deal already came together was quite late going into that season. Basically, there were no expectations because I think the years before, there were not a lot of amazing memories in F3. And then we had a very memorable season altogether, competing against all the big teams out there. Honestly, of course, there were hectic moments, but overall so many positive and great memories _ winning six races in a row, for example, in such a competitive field. I enjoyed it. Also, even on the radio I still talked in Dutch. That__ something very rare. It was great. I enjoyed it, coming straight from go-karting into such a great car to drive. And then with the team _ they had the history with my dad, and some of the guys were still involved. For me, it was a great time before going straight into Formula 1. Yeah. I mean, it__ a fresh start now. I think it__ not about one half of a season _ that doesn__ define what you can do. I think he's also quite easy in that. Some people maybe dwell on it a bit more, but for Checo, it__ a new start. You__e excited _ new cars, completely new cars also. He has driven for a lot of different teams, so he knows a lot about how teams work. Every single team works a little differently. That__ already a very interesting trait _ it__ nice to understand what people are good at or where some teams are worse. That__ how it goes. Also, the behaviour of cars _ he__ been in a lot of different regulations, a lot of different rule sets _ some things were allowed, some were not, got banned, things like that. So, yeah, to have that general understanding of how a great car is, how a car is that__ not fantastic _ I think it__ very valuable for them to start with. He has worked with many big teams, so hopefully that will push them forward in the beginning, because it__ never easy to jump into Formula One and be competitive straight away. But we__l see how that goes.",Netherlands,thursday,Red Bull
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Yeah. It was good. After Budapest, I had some time off with family, some relaxation. Went to Brazil, did some karting, some driving. Just had some time off with my family, recharged, and now ready for the rest of the season. I mean, obviously, we have improved a lot since the beginning of the year. We brought some upgrades in the car that worked quite well. We know the midfield is super tight. A single half-tenth can put you out of Q3, or even less than this. Like, Budapest was super close. So, I think it depends a lot on your performance in qualifying as well. Hopefully, we can keep up like this. I think it's six consecutive points finishes for Sauber, and honestly, it's great to be fighting for something like this now. I think we brought some upgrades in the car that improved and put us in a better position to fight for points. It was not from one moment to another. This doesn't happen suddenly in Formula 1. It's a process and you learn, you improve, and I feel like this has been coming for quite a bit. Austria was a moment _ it's a track that I really like, the car suited quite well for that track as well, and we had a very good run there. I think you get the confidence of the team, yourself, and we managed to score some good points there and in the next races as well. I don't know. It's difficult to say and what to predict. This weekend can be quite crazy with the weather, as Max said. It's a track I really like. I raced here once or twice, if I'm not wrong, but I really enjoy racing here. The atmosphere, the crowd _ for sure, in Formula 1 it's going to be crazy with this guy here. So, looking forward to this weekend. Yeah, I asked him a few things like I always do, to be honest. So, it's not specific here, but I think what I am more curious about is the banking with the Formula 1 car _ quite a big car _ and the banking, it's a different feeling I have not experienced this year yet. So, I'm looking forward to driving in T3. Last corner should be flat, so shouldn't be a big thing, but all this section of corners looks interesting. I did some laps in the sim, in the factory and at home as well, so prepared myself and looking forward to the weekend here. Well, I think everyone has been doing high line since the beginning. Unless... what do you think? Low line? I think it__ more of a party for you. Yeah. It's great when you go back to where you started and you see that six or seven-year-old kids driving go-karts. It came to my mind when I was that age. They are so small and driving go-karts and stuff. So, it brought back a bit of memory, and it was very nice to spend some time with them, talk a bit to these young drivers. They had so many questions, and it__ always nice. I remember when I met Max _ it was in Adria. He was walking in the paddock there, and there were so many kids trying to go behind him. I thought, ""I__ not going to go behind him now _ it__ impossible to talk to him."" So, I went back to CRG, the team I was in for karting, and he entered the tent because he was also a driver for them back then. I asked (Giancarlo) Tinini, the boss, if he could ask Max to take a picture with me, and he organised everything. Max was super cool. I asked him some questions. He was very young at the time _ I think 17, 18 _ just entered F1, and he made my day there. It was very cool to talk to him. I__ not going to say much here because he__ next to me, so I__l just leave it like this. I mean, it's the best car I've ever driven in my life. I think I agree with what he said _ the faster they go, the more fun they are. They're very cool to drive. I love it. Look, I think it__ a big company. They have their goals and a lot of people deciding these types of things. It__ not up to me to judge anyone__ decision. Obviously, Felipe is a great friend of mine, and I really feel like he deserved a chance to be in Formula One. It__ not over yet _ maybe one day he gets his shot. He__ a Formula 2 champion, so I believe everyone that wins F2 should have a chance in Formula One. Felipe is a great guy, and I feel like he deserved it. But again, it__ a big company _ they have their reasons to decide things, and things like this happen. So, yeah, that__ my point of view.",Netherlands,thursday,Sauber
Oliver Bearman,"Yeah. It was a nice break. It was fun. A lot of training to prepare for the second half of the season. It was also nice to spend time with my family and not think about racing for a few weeks. But quite quickly, I was bored of not being at the racetrack, and I'm happy to be back here in Zandvoort. No. I think we couldn't do much more. Since Silverstone, we've had a really consistent run of results, consistently just outside of the points, which is a shame. On one side, it's easy to get frustrated by these results, but at the same time, to have four races where we were like that and very close to the points is also quite promising. It shows that we can be there, but we just need a bit of fine-tuning to make that final step. The first half has been very intense _ 14 races. Last year in Formula 2, that was a full season, and now we've done that before August. So, it's a big change compared to what I've been used to, but I think the break has come at a good time to help me reset, and I'm looking forward to the second half. There have been some really high moments, but too many mistakes. Yeah. I mean, mainly, I've only really driven single-seaters in my career in terms of race cars. I've done a little bit of GT and prototype driving _ but probably just one day in each. Something that I really enjoyed driving was GT. Obviously, everything is a bit slower, but with everything happening slower, it gives you more time to consider things and think about your driving and be really on top of it. So, I think F1 is incredibly fun to drive. At this stage of F1, where we're right at the limit of the regulations _ the last season of these regulations _ the cars are very much on the limit in terms of driving. So, from one lap to the next, if the wind changes or you add a little bit of balance to the car, it can go from being perfect to too much, and sometimes it's difficult then to get the confidence. But these cars are the most fun I've ever had driving, so I really enjoy them. Yeah, I did a season of F4 with them. It was a very good year for myself, and it was really fun to spend it with the team. Actually, I was pretty much living in Holland that year because of COVID. So that meant lots of chocolate sprinkles and toast _ I don__ know the name of it, but that was my staple diet, basically. Yeah _ Hagelslag! It__ the chocolate sprinkles they have here. That was probably my favourite memory of that year. Honestly, it__ a great team _ lots of really hardworking people. Just to see Fritz still there working hard after all those years is really impressive. Yeah. I mean, largely agree. The first thing is, from their point of view, it makes sense to go with two guys who are known quantities within the sport. Taking a rookie is, of course, a bigger risk than taking two guys with a lot of experience. But I do think there are a lot of people not on this grid who have a huge amount of talent and should have the opportunity to show what they can do. Felipe is one of them. At the top of every category, there are a lot of great IndyCar drivers who would do a good job here. But that decision makes sense. I mean, if I was at the top of an F1 team starting out from nothing, I would do the same, I think.",Netherlands,thursday,Haas
Lando Norris,"No. It's gone up a lot prior to Wentworth. It has come down a bit _ not as much as I would like _ but I had a good time away with my friends, playing some golf and doing different things. So, a good break. I felt good before. I feel good now. I went through some harder times at the beginning of the year _ there were some tricky moments _ but we worked on quite a bit, me from my side and the team from their side, to improve and get a bit back on track. We did that, so it was nice to see some of those results come back my way. But, there always was, still is, and always will be more things to improve on and try and get stronger at. That__ what Formula 1 is, really, at the end of the day. I feel good, ready to go again _ ready for a long, tricky, challenging second part of the season, but all for good reasons. I mean, of course it's about the championship, but we do that race by race. Everyone has their own way of saying that and doing it. But everyone takes it race by race, really. We want to win, of course. I always want to get maximum points and make my life easy, but it's never that simple. We still have good competition, even in Budapest. The Ferraris were extremely quick, and George was not too far away. We still expect good battles and good competition. But as everyone knows, we expect a good battle between us as teammates _ between Oscar and myself _ and that__ the one I__ most looking forward to. I mean, of course. We've, as a team, been stronger this year, but I feel like other people have caught up a little bit in the last couple of races. What made us very strong here last year, other people have caught up on, but we've also improved in other places. So, I don't expect to win by 20 seconds or something, but_ I would love it if that was the case! I'll try and achieve a similar thing. But I don't think we expect any race to go easily now. We always come into races wanting to win, expecting a one-two, and that__ our aim and target every weekend. But we never get complacent and think it__ going to be an easy one. We always expect a good challenge. If we don__ and we__e further ahead, then that__ just a bonus. That__, it__... I think that__ really down to personal _ probably why you__e asking all three of us. It__ a personal preference. I would tend to say I don__ go with it. I don__ use it. I don__ really say I have it or whatever. For me, I find it quite easy to set back races one at a time. Even if it__ a good race, yeah, you try and feel good and feel confident. So, I think the momentum side _ the deeper meaning _ is just: does it give you some confidence? Does it give you more knowledge? Does it put you in a better mindset? Maybe. If all of that comes under that word, then maybe I would agree with it. But just the fact of having two good races doesn__ mean I__ going to have a third good one. Especially when you__e racing the best drivers in the world, when you__e in a sport where everyone__ in different cars, with so many variables _ I think there are fewer variables in other sports. When there__ so much variability, it__ hard to just classify things as momentum. Normally, there__ always a much bigger reason behind things. So, yeah, a tricky answer. I never say I have good momentum or believe in that kind of thing. But does it give you more confidence and set you up for the next weekend in a better mindset? Then yes, under that bracket, I would say yes. I mean, could I at times have made better decisions? I think so. If I had that thought a little bit more in my head at the time... probably the main one was China Sprint qualifying. I think my lap was good enough for pole until the final hairpin where I locked up. If I had that thought just before braking _ ""It__ a long season, don__ try and be a hero"" _ I wouldn__ have finished it like that. I lost eight points there. Canada _ if I could rerun that and just be a little bit smarter and not take so much risk, could I have not lost quite a few points there? Yes. I don__ know. But I__ also the guy that _ I wouldn__ say I regret those moments. Do I wish it changed? Do I wish it was better? Do I wish I could do it again? Yeah. But at the same time, I don__ regret making those decisions at the time, because that__ me, that__ life, and that__ the way it goes. Sometimes it goes your way and you get lucky, sometimes it doesn__ and you don__ make the best decisions. But those are also the times you learn the most and help yourself more for the future. So, no _ I live my life not by regretting what I__e, more trying to learn and improving from it. No, I think at the minute, things haven__ really changed. Budapest was a bit of an outlier. My decision to go onto the one-stop was more... you__ have to be pretty daft if I was to box after everyone else ahead of me had boxed _ just to follow suit and do nothing different. You don__ even need to be smart to know to do something different. It was more to get ahead of George _ to give myself an opportunity to be ahead of him _ not necessarily to win the race at that point. So, it was pretty amazing that it turned out that way and it was a perfect result. I didn__ make that decision thinking, __K, this is my race and I can try and win it now._ Maybe it wasn__ a perfect harmonic race between us as a team because it didn__ fall exactly into the place with what we normally go by, but at the same time it__ an example of what can happen in racing sometimes. I think we both want, as drivers, things not to be overly strict. We don__ want to be told not to race. We__e here as individuals to race and prove who can do a better job. So of course there were discussions, there have been reviews _ every race we make tweaks to things. We have a good understanding as a team. That happened after Budapest. No major changes. But we still have a Constructors_ to win, and that__ the priority at this point. Certainly. But that__ something that, probably for a while, we__e already been doing. As much as we want to win races and get into second or third at times _ and maybe at some points we could__e taken more risks _ I think both, for a little while now, we__e understood the risk element a bit more for a while now. I think we know when we need to take a risk _ in qualifying and things like that _ and we also know that during a race, maybe for one more point, you might not risk anything. But for the win? Then you would risk more. It also depends who you__e racing. That__ a really important factor. That__ part of being a racing driver: you__e got to understand who you can take risks with, who you can__, and when to take those risks. I think that__ a general thing, but it__ also something I think you have to understand a little bit more when you are fighting for a championship. Like from the earlier question _ if I could go back and change what I did in China and not take that risk, I would probably do it. So, I probably wasn__ quite on top of everything and as thoughtful as I needed to be so early on, Round 2 of a championship season. But like I said, I__e learned from that and I make better decisions now. I__e said this in a lot of interviews when people ask about Andrea, but for me, Andrea has been the most important part of everything. I mean, I__ biased_ I__e had a few different team principals over the years, but for me_ I don__ want to say I__ biased, but I am, but I do genuinely believe that Andrea is the most switched-on, humanly understanding, genuine person and the best team principal you can have. He__ also one of only three I__e ever worked with, but I__e been with McLaren for a good amount of years and seen a lot of changes happen _ a lot of people come and go. But actually, one of the biggest differences now isn__ that we changed the whole team. 99% of the team is the same as we had three years prior. But it__ the person in charge: Andrea. It__ his ability to understand people, to put them together, to know how they work, how to get the most out of every single person. I think he has a better understanding of this than anyone I__e ever met, even inside of racing, outside of racing. I think he__ one of the smartest people on that side of things. I think that__ what you need to run a team of a couple thousand people is someone who understands how to get the most out of every individual and how to bring everyone together at the same time. So, yep_ hands down _ I don__ want to seem like I like him too much _ but for me, Andrea has been _ there are lots of important pieces in our success, but I put a lot of it down to Andrea. I__l thank Andrea for the rest of my life after the season we__e had this year, because most of it is down to him. I mean, I did roll the dice. Yes. I__e certainly had a little bit of luck. I__e also been unlucky. But that__ life. I can__ choose those things. I__ lucky that I__e been with McLaren for the last seven years. I could not have been with them for five of those, so I__e also made good decisions. I like to believe, I back myself, I__e made good decisions along the way and especially this year. I__e improved as a driver this year. I__e had a car that I found a lot trickier to drive _ just as much as everyone complains when they have a car that doesn__ suit them or drive as well as what they like _ and I made some good steps forward to come back and have some good races. I would not have won in Budapest if I didn__ improve on those things myself, and that was not luck. That was hard work, a lot of dedication with my engineers and my team, both at the track and away from it. So yes, I__e had a little bit of luck here and there _ everyone needs a bit in their life _ but so has probably every other driver at some races. I__e also made good decisions, kept myself out of trouble, stuck by the rules. All of these things are part of being a racing driver, and at times they__e earned me points. So that__ also down to me doing a good job. It doesn__ change too much, honestly. We are the furthest one away, so I do a lot of walking and scootering every time. I don__ mind _ it doesn__ change too much. Sometimes the weather here throws some curveballs, like we had a couple of years ago, and maybe this year too. So, it__ never as much of a predictable weekend as you would like. From the side of walking from the paddock to here, it__ actually a good opportunity for fans to be there and get closer to us than at some other places. I don__ mind these things. I__ not a driver that gets too fussed about.... like, I get in my zone when I put my helmet on. Before then, I can be pretty chill, have a good conversation with anyone. My zone is putting my helmet on. For other they__e putting on their headphones on. I__e tried that a few times. I don__ really have a preference. I__ quite easygoing. I don__ mind scootering past people, crashing into them.",Netherlands,thursday,McLaren
Alex Albon,"No. I didn__ play at all. I still think I would beat Lando, though! Yeah, it was good fun. I was doing a training camp _ went hiking, went swimming. It was nice. It's an interesting track for us. It's a bit of a bogey track because it doesn__ necessarily suit our car, but every year we come here, it seems to go okay. Still in question why that is. I think the wind here is generally from one place, and that one place is quite beneficial for our car. There__ always weather changing around here, and we tend to do well in races where there__ wet-slicks, transitional kind of conditions. So that helps. And I do also think this is a bit of a confidence track. The more laps you do around here _ it__ so narrow _ and we__e just come after the summer break, so there__ a bit of rust in there. But if you can get up to speed and into the rhythm of the circuit early, you can have a good weekend. Our clear goal would be to try to maintain fifth in the Constructors_ Championship. I think it__ possible, but it__ clear that others have caught up _ if not maybe even overtaken us _ in terms of raw speed. I don't think that's going to be the case every weekend. I think it's going to change race by race, but we definitely have a tough task ahead of us. Haas have made a great step as well, which has put themselves within target of us. So, we're going to be elbows out for the rest of the season. Yeah. I think Lando answered it well. There__ no black and white answer. It__ very grey. Every weekend__ a different track, different set-up, some circuits suit you, some don__. The car suiting the track, the driver suiting the track _ so many outsourced components that make up a weekend. It__ very hard to find that consistency to say, ""I__ in a good swing of things right now."" The one thing I__ say is, for me, the whole year feels like a kind of momentum, to me. The first time I drove the car this year, I knew the car was going to be good _ it felt good to drive _ and you can carry that throughout the whole year. There are situations where you get an upgrade that suits you more and that__ your good spell to finish the year strong, you might say, or it can go the other way and it works against your style. So, yeah, it__ very situational. I would say one of the benefits of my year _ and I think also to Checo__ and Valtteri__ _ is the regulation reset. You don__ have the drivers carrying all the experience from the last few years of the car__ regulations, so it__ a bit more of a level playing field once you return. I don__ know how involved they were in terms of keeping sharp _ training, driving, and so on. I remember during my year, I was doing some Pirelli tests and a lot of simulator work, which definitely helped. I think we__e in slightly different positions because they have a lot more experience and can probably get away with not doing as much. My year was a bit more about learning and making sure I was as prepared as possible for my Williams seat. I don__ think with their experience they__l have missed out too much _ they__l fall back into the swing of things pretty quickly. Not too much. It__ similar in Spa as well. In our motorhome or in our tree house, the trucks by the garages leave our driver kit and equipment there. At Williams, we don__ have a designated room _ it__ a room, but it__ got a glass door, so not great when you__e getting changed. But that__ pretty much it.",Netherlands,thursday,Williams
Isack Hadjar,"I feel in great shape. I made sure I trained hard that last week of holidays to make sure I could still fit in my seat. So, yeah, I feel good. To be honest, it was a red-flagged race, so we didn__ get to drive much, I remember. I didn__ get points for that win. It was that race. Yeah. It__ a track I know. I__e been here in FRECA, in F4, in F2 _ so I__e been here a couple of times. It__ not a track I really love, to be honest with you, but it doesn__ matter. I try and be as fast. Nothing really, because Liam scored eight points in the last two races. So, the car is definitely working well. It__ just about not making mistakes when you don__ want them. I feel like raw pace in the last two race weekends was very strong for me. There__ been a bit of reliability involved, but still, I need to do a better job. Raw speed is definitely here, so I__ not worried. Honestly, still the same _ keep exploring, keep trying things. I__ not really here to play it safe and just try and score points. I'm trying my stuff and learning as much as I can. If that means mistakes, it__ normal _ I__ a rookie. But I__ trying my own things and I__ enjoying it. Yeah, I think it__ just statistics really _ momentum. I__e never thought like, __ell, I__ sat in my car, I__e got momentum on my side._ To me, it doesn__ really matter. I mean, I don__ know myself, so I can__ help you. Sorry. To be honest, it__ nothing really new to me. The road to F1 was more than uncertain as well. So, I__ used to not really knowing what I__ going to do next. I__ used to living in the present and giving my maximum. So, yeah, I__ not worried. I__ just focused.",Netherlands,thursday,RB
Lando Norris,"Yeah. I'm dead. It was tough. We weren't really planning on the one-stop at the beginning but after the first lap it was kind of our only option to get back into things. It was tough. The final stint with Oscar catching, I was pushing flat out. My voice has gone a little bit. Pretty good, rewarding even more because of that, but the perfect result today. I mean, I didn__ think it would probably get us the win. I thought maybe it would get us at least into second. I knew our pace was good, even in the first stint behind George. I couldn't get past, but the pace was strong. So, I knew if I just had some clean air and I could push that I could maybe make things work, and that's what we did. It__ always a bit of a gamble, these kinds of things, but it also requires no mistakes, good laps, good strategy, all these things. And that's what we had today. So, I'm very happy. I think it__ so tightly fought, it's hard to say if momentum's on anyone's side, but we're fighting hard. It's fun. It's tough but fun racing against Oscar and great for us as a team. Another one-two. Our 200th win actually in Formula 1. Credit to Oscar, he put up a good charge and I just about held on. I look forward to plenty more of these. Thank you so much. I think it's one of the first ones I've won in probably this manner. I've not won many races, so most circumstances are still new, but I think it's the first one where doing a completely alternate strategy to most, giving myself that opportunity, worked out. I think there have been some others where going long in the first stint, Miami, then getting the Safety Car, things like that have helped me from a luck side. Today, there was not really any of that. So, I think the most rewarding from __et's try to do something different_ and it working out, which was a good one. It's a tough strategy to do, but it worked out. That's the most important thing. And, honestly, I didn't really think it was going to work for the majority of that second stint. But with every lap, I kind of gained more confidence that it was going to be closer and closer. So, yeah, definitely a rewarding one. I mean, it's more just making them last at the pace that we were at. I made the Mediums last until, like, what, lap 32 or something. So it wasn't a terrible thought that I can make the Hards last until the end. It was more I just knew I'd have to push flat out for basically every single lap, and that's when it gets a little bit tricky. The tyres get hot. It's easy to make mistakes. The last few laps, the rubber is probably pretty low, and it's just so easy to lock a tyre into one, into two, the chicane, things like that. So, yeah, I knew I could make the tyres get to the end quite easily, but it was more to stay ahead of the other people. It was trying to get ahead of mainly George and Charles at that point. I didn't have a lot of hope that I'd still be in a fight with Oscar till the very end but turned out to be. So that was even better. __rilliant_. Yeah. That's actually what I said over the line the first lap. Because I did, I watched quite a few videos of lap one to Turn 1. Clearly, it didn't work. My start was good. I think Charles' was pretty good as well. Oscar then came over to the left, and I was kind of just hoping both were going to be on the right. I got a bit of a slipstream on Oscar. I had to pull out to the right, but Oscar could stay in the slipstream of Charles, which then gave him a bit more speed again. But at that point, it was hard to back out and go to the left because I would have had to brake a bit. I mean, I'll look back and review it and see what I could have done better. I feel like I was more just unlucky with how things panned out. I think if we were to do it again, most of the time things would turn out better than they did today. So, I think it was just worst-case scenario. But my start was good, and I have nothing to really complain about. I think it's already tough, and it's going to continue to be tough. It's pretty small margins between us. I'm sure there's some things I can do better on and improve on, and I'm sure he'll probably say a similar thing. So, it's going to be a good and tough battle probably till the end. It takes a lot out of you trying to focus so much for every single session, race, everything. So, it's going be a long second half of the season, I'm sure, but at the same time, I'm looking forward to a nice break, a bit of time to rest. And, yeah, try and come back even better because there are those things I need to improve on and want to improve on. I'm not giving myself the best opportunities. Even though the results have looked great, I'm not making my life very easy for myself at the minute. So if I can work on those things, then I'll be in a better place. When Will asked me, __hat do you think of the one-stop?_ I think at that point, I was already, like, seven seconds behind Oscar and eight or nine behind Charles. So, not that I thought my race was over, but it was pretty slim that I was going to be able to at least fight from there, even on a perfect two-stop strategy. So, my expectations were not high, but I was more banking on a safety car or a VSC or something to bring me back into the race. But I didn't have any of that. In the end, I guess it didn't matter. I can't remember if it was just before George boxed or just after that. Will said, __hat do we think of a one-stop?_ and I said, __et's do it._ My confidence wasn't the highest, but it was my best chance of trying to do something. And it turned out to be a little bit trickier because it actually allowed me to fight until the very end for the win. Not sure it still felt like the best strategy, but I think with how difficult overtaking was, it turned out to be pretty good. I hope we dominate.",Hungary,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. I pushed as hard as I could. I think after I saw Lando going for a one-stop I knew I was going to have to overtake on track, which is much easier said than done around here. Tried a few things. It was a gamble either way and today, unfortunately, we were just on the wrong side of it. The team did a great job. The car really came alive in the second half of the race and has been great all weekend. So, thank you to the team and looking forward to a couple weeks off. Yes and no. At that point, he didn't really have much to lose, so it wasn't a huge surprise. I don't know if trying to undercut Leclerc was the right call in the end, but we can go through it after. I think I needed to be at least a couple of tenths closer, which was going to take a mistake from Lando to achieve that. I feel like that was going to be my best chance. You never want to try and save it for the next lap and then it never comes. So, I thought I would at least try and, yeah, not quite. Thank you. Mixed, I would say. You know, whenever you lose a race by such a little amount, it's obviously a bit painful, but I mean, I'm sure it was entertaining from the outside. It was entertaining from the inside as well. So, you know, pretty fun race, all things considered. But, obviously, when you're on the losing side of that battle, it's a little bit difficult. But, yeah, we tried our best, I think, and, you know, we got ahead of Charles. I don't know what happened to him in the last stint, but, yeah, some things to look back on, whether we should have done something a bit different in terms of strategy, but very easy to say in hindsight. I was confident, but I knew it was going to be still incredibly tough because getting close to the car ahead is one thing, but trying to overtake is a completely different story. I knew that I was catching him a lot when I had clean air, but as soon as I got close, it was incredibly tough to stay close enough. There are so many corners in the middle sector that in some cases it almost feels like you do a better job in some corners, and then you pay the price at the next one because you're even closer. That made it very tough. And then with such long corners to end the lap, it just kills any downforce you've got. So, I knew that was going to be incredibly tough. Even if I had more laps, I'm not sure the result would have been any different, but I certainly tried. Not that much, I don't think. I was able to close the gap again pretty quickly for the last lap. But it's kind of like I said, getting to within six or seven tenths was doable, but to then get even closer than that, I think I needed brand new Softs to be able to do much from that point. So, yeah, it was always going to be tough when I got close. But, I mean, you never want to not take an opportunity that you think is there in case another one never comes up. So, I had to go for it and, you know, in hindsight, obviously you can say maybe I should have waited another lap, but I'm pretty convinced that even if I had waited one more lap, it wouldn't have changed anything. I think we had to try and do something to beat Leclerc because it wasn't obvious that we just had enough pace to blow past him and go and win that way. So, we tried something. Was it the right thing in the end? I don't know. But it's always much easier when you're the car behind to take that risk. For Lando, there was virtually nothing to lose by trying a one-stop race. For myself, potentially there was. And, yeah, we'll look back and see if there was anything we should have done differently. But a two-stop was always the plan before the race, so it wasn't even really discussed that much about doing a one-stop. So, it was certainly a gamble. We did speak about it a bit before the race, so it wasn't completely off the table. But, in the race, I got asked about it. Very difficult to know from the cockpit what is going to be the best thing to do. Like I said, when you're the car behind, your risk-reward ratio is always much different. So, yeah, there's always that. Could we have matched Lando? That's, I guess, the question that I don't have the answer to. So, I guess that's the only thing. But we wanted to try and win the race as well, and the best way of trying to beat Lando is by trying to win the race as well. That was obviously an intention, but I think we'll definitely analyse if there was something we could have done a bit differently. I mean, the biggest lead of the year has been 23, and it's not moved within 10 points for the last ten races almost. So, I'm not really that fussed with that. Obviously, it would have been nice to have the extra points, but I don't think it's necessarily a trend. One second different, and the trend would have looked quite different today. Things happening in the last few races differently could have meant quite a different picture. But you can say that about pretty much every race this year and about every championship ever. So, I'm not concerned at all. I think the pace for the first half of the year has been very, very strong, and I think the last few races as well have been very good. I feel like I've driven a lot of strong races, and it's been very tightly fought. So, I expect more of the same after the break. Yeah, very much the same. I think it's going to be a tough second half of the year. It has been tough already, and the margins are very fine. So, I think it's going to be great watching. I've been happy with qualifying this year. Still not been perfect, but it's certainly been a good improvement from last year. I don't really feel like there's one area that's lacking. I felt the same last year; it's just that I never got it all together on the same weekend very often. This year, I felt much more like that, and it's just going to be about trying to do that every weekend to the end of the year. So that's going to be the key. I mean, I hope the same thing, but I think we will have competition at certain points through the year. I don't know what happened to Charles in the second half of the race, but clearly something happened because he looked quite quick for the first half. So, I think there are some tracks that other teams have historically been quite quick at, and we'll wait and see if that's the same this year.",Hungary,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah. Really happy with the race today. Obviously, yesterday qualifying was a bit of a surprise. This whole weekend's been a bit surprising for everyone, but so happy to be back on the podium. It's one of those where you sort of commit to a bit of a dive bomb. If the driver in front moves, you're already right on the limit of grip and there's not much room for manoeuvre. I think we made contact on the second time, but just glad to get through it. Nice way to go into the break. It's definitely better than the races we've had so far. So really pleased with that. Yeah, it's good to be back on the podium. It's obviously been a challenging run of form for us as a team these last six or so races, so it's a great way to enter the break. We reverted on some of the items we brought. Early in the season we brought a new rear suspension that clearly wasn't performing as we'd have hoped. But it was also a pretty unique weekend. You see the results by McLaren, and it was quite an unusual finishing order from P3 down. Obviously, Max was quite out of position. The Astons had a really strong race weekend as well. So, I don't think we should get carried away with the result. But, clearly, in terms of pace, it was our best race of the season bar Canada. You know, when you're coming down the straight at 330 and you sort of dive into the corner, you're right on the limit of your car's grip. You can't just brake and turn to avoid somebody because you're already at the limit of that grip. So, I made my intentions really clear, diving to the inside, and he moved after he had committed to braking, which is not allowed in the rules because of that reason. So, he did it once. I wasn't happy about it. Second time, I was like, well, I'm going to just send it down the inside now, and he did it again, and we made contact. I was glad to get by. But I think when you watch it on TV, you think, __h, why can't you just turn to avoid it?_ But as I said, you are right on the limit of the car's potential.",Hungary,post-race,Mercedes
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, today, I don't understand anything in Formula 1! Honestly, the whole qualifying has been extremely difficult. When I say extremely difficult, it's not exaggerating. It was super, super difficult. It was difficult for us to get to Q2, it was difficult for us to get to Q3. In Q3 the conditions changed a little bit, everything became a lot trickier, and I knew I just had to do a clean lap to target third. At the end of the day, it__ pole position. I definitely did not expect that. Yeah, I could definitely feel it a lot. I was also a bit on the lower side of the downforce, so when the rain started in Q2 I was just hoping that it wouldn't stay there. It didn't. The conditions changed, which made everything very tricky. And at the end, we are on pole position. Honestly, I have no words. Yeah, it's probably one of the best pole positions I've ever had because it's the most unexpected for sure. Yeah, I mean the start and Turn 1 will be key. I have no idea how it will go, but one thing for sure is that I'll do absolutely everything in order to keep that first place. If we manage to do that, then that should make our life easier for the rest of the race. Well, today is a day where I don't understand anything anymore in motorsport! I mean, honestly, qualifying felt horrible. From the first lap to maybe the penultimate lap, everything felt out of place. It really felt like we had done a step backwards from FP3. And in terms of competitiveness, Q1 I was on the limit, barely made it to Q2. Q2 I was on the limit, I mean, I did quite a big mistake in Turn 4, but still, it wasn't easy to get to Q3. And then Q3, the conditions I think changed for everybody. I basically just did a clean lap, which I think was a really good lap because those conditions were very difficult to get everything right. And I did, but I was really happy about the lap, and it's probably the biggest, the most surprising pole position I've ever done. I think after FP3 it wouldn't have been so surprising. But after Q1 and Q2, I really thought we would struggle to get into the top five even. So, I'm very happy. I mean, I don't drive the McLaren car, so it's difficult to comment but for sure the car was a lot more difficult in Q3 than it was in Q2, but then I don't know if it's more difficult compared to the McLaren or easier. But for sure, we gained competitiveness not only towards the McLaren, but towards everybody in Q3. Because when I finished the lap, I really thought that this was probably good enough for P3 just, but definitely not P1. So, it was a good surprise. However, it also felt worse for me from Q2 to Q3. It was just very tricky. It's a big boost. I mean, the team has been pushing like crazy to bring upgrades. Last weekend the team brought an upgrade as well, and it helped us to go in the right direction. We didn't know how much. And as I said in Spa, I think we need to judge over a few races and not only one. But yes, to be able to be on pole position today is amazing, and it means that we are doing something right. So, again, I think for many things I did not expect to be on pole also because I was saying on Thursday, this is probably the worst track for me statistically over the season. I've always trailed. But this weekend, for some reason, I found some pace. So yeah, it's good. I mean, I don't know. I think there's some rain around tomorrow, so if that is the case, then it's obviously easier to overtake. But it's always better to be starting first, especially on this track. So, I'm very happy with my starting position and now full focus on trying to keep it tomorrow. Not really, to be honest. I didn't do anything special for this weekend that I normally don't do. I knew it was a weekend where normally on paper I struggle more, but that doesn't change my approach. I always try and prepare the weekend in the best way I can. But for some reason, I also think that the upgrade in Spa definitely helped me to extract a little bit more. And as I've been saying, often before Spa, I had to set up the car in a very, very extreme way early on in the season to try and extract something out of this car in qualifying. However, it was making everything very inconsistent, and I was struggling to be on top of the car all the time. However, in Spa with the upgrade, it helped me to be a bit more in a reasonable window car-wise, and it feels like it's fitting a little bit more the way I drive in qualifying when I start pushing. And that's really important because since the beginning of the season I've been struggling particularly in quali, which is normally one of my strengths. But since Spa, it's coming back towards me a little bit. You just have to kind of reset whatever you've learned in Q1 and Q2 because everything feels different. The way you need to take the corners is different. Somehow, I feel like it kind of helped me to go with the scrubbed [tyre] in the beginning of Q3, because I think when Oscar and Lando went on the new there, the track felt very different. So, they adjusted for the second run in Q3. I arrived in the second run in Q3 just thinking that the bad feeling was down to the scrubbed [tyre]. So, I just went all in for the second run in Q3, and it kind of went all well, even though it felt bad in relative terms, it was a very good lap. So yeah, I'm very happy. It wasn't really in my thought process for quali. I just went flat out from sector one to sector three and tried to survive Sector 3 because Sector 3 just feels very weak with the overheating. But it's not like I was saving anything in Sector 1 to be better in Sector 3.
OP: Yeah, similar things, really push as much as you can because if you leave time on the table expecting to get it back at the end of the lap and you don't, then you feel pretty dumb. Similar things. I think the wind played quite a big factor in the last sector especially. But there wasn't really much consideration about saving through the lap. I think for tomorrow, yeah. Normally it is a strength of our car, but Charles and Lewis as well weren't slow in the long runs we did yesterday. So, we'll wait and see. No. I'm sorry, but I won't go into the detail of that, but yeah, then we went back towards where we thought it was best. Monaco is a little bit different because I felt like the speed was always there, but then we were really struggling to transfer that to Sunday and to finally win. Here has been very different because the pace was never there, so then it was difficult to transfer anything on the Sunday. But finally, the pace is there on Saturday, and now our full focus will be to try and keep that pace for tomorrow. And I hope that it will be the start of getting that feeling on this track, which for now didn't really get on with my driving style. But obviously for now I'll just focus on maximising tomorrow, but after the weekend, I'm anyway doing the test on Wednesday, so I've got two days free where I can analyse a little bit why I had a better feeling this weekend compared to other years. No. It was making the car very unpredictable, and very difficult whenever you go for the last tenth or tenth and a half in Q3. It was extremely difficult to get it right. And if you would just overstep a little bit the limit of that previous car, then you would pay the price a lot. Whereas with this car, you can play a little bit more with the limit. And if you go over the limit a little bit, you just don't lose as much. So yeah, the car is more predictable, which is a good thing. I don't know. I don't think that's where we expect the biggest gains, but for sure, it probably makes a difference. However, I won't go too much into the details. But the first part of the race in Spa was better than Silverstone for sure, but we'll see. Now hopefully tomorrow we have another example of feeling better in those conditions.",Hungary,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I think the wind changed a lot. It always sounds so pathetic blaming things on the wind, but the wind basically did a 180 from Q2 to Q3. And yeah, it just meant a lot of the corners felt completely different. My first lap in Q3 felt pretty terrible because I wasn't used to it. And then I thought the second lap was a lot better, but it was even slower. So yeah, just difficult to judge in those conditions and maybe not the best execution, but I was a bit surprised that we couldn't go quicker than that. Second is still a decent spot to start, so we'll see what we can do tomorrow. Yeah, I mean, Charles has been quick all weekend. Even this morning he was closer than we expected. Things just changed a little bit and I guess he did a very good job. So yeah, well done to him. I wasn__ expecting to be second to a Ferrari this weekend, but he's done a good job. It's going to be a fun race tomorrow with a bit more involved. Depends where you're sat. If you're sat where Charles is, fantastic. If you're sat where I'm sat, bizarre and somewhat frustrating. But yeah, I mean, I think the conditions completely changed, and it was just weird. My first lap felt terrible because I was pushing too much and kind of with the wind direction from the first two sessions in mind. So, then I felt like I did a better job on the second lap of managing expectations, and it was even worse. So yeah, a bizarre session, but I need to look back and see what differences it made. Things definitely felt more tricky for myself as well in Q3, but I think for everybody it would have been difficult. So that's not our excuse. Yeah. I mean, it's kind of what I just explained. My first lap in Q3, I wasn't that surprised that it was half a second off because of some, I mean, mistakes is probably harsh on myself, but just not predicting what the wind was going to do in certain corners maybe as well as I could have. But the second lap, I thought I did a better job of adjusting my expectations, and like I said, I didn't go any faster. So yeah, a bit strange, one for us to look through, but it wasn't very fun losing that half a second. Pretty confident. It was good last year, so hopefully it can be good again this year. But yeah, like Charles said, there's some rain around. We'll see if that impacts the race. But I think our pace has been good, but Charles has been quick all weekend, in certain sessions. It is a very difficult track to overtake on, and it's not going to be the easiest place to try and regain the lead. It's hard to know. It's still off the racing line, so I expect it to still have the same problems. But we'll have to wait and see. Pit lane? That's probably it.",Hungary,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"I mean, yeah. From how our form is, of course. But I think Charles did a good job on the last lap, probably risked a little bit more in these conditions. The wind changed a lot and really seemed to punish us in a bigger way. So, I mean, not too many complaints. We thought we both did some good laps at the end, and we were just slow. Nothing to complain of, but Charles did a good job. Yeah, it's just, I mean, it's a long lap with many corners, so it's tricky. But by Q2 I think we showed how quick we can go and our advantage. But as soon as the wind changed everything went away and the last sector became even trickier again. Not an easy lap to put things together. When you do it, it feels nice. When you don't, like in Q3, not so happy. Both. I want to go forward and I want to win. And if I can do that then I'll get points. I think it's going to be an exciting race. I would expect us to have a bit more pace than Charles, so I'm looking forward to it. I'll just copy and paste, yeah. Exactly the same. Q2 felt very good, felt confident to improve. So, into Q3, aiming for a similar lap time, similar limits, and just felt pretty dreadful. Same things. I wasn't surprised that I was a 15.4 in the first run. But in the second lap, it's just hard to know how much more to push or not push. And I was like, oh, it's a much better lap, and I was 15.4 again. So just similar thing. The wind has such big effects on the car when you're driving. It's quite easy for it to be half a second swing. So yeah, frustrating because we definitely seem to have a good gap, but in Q3 it seemed to drift away from us as a team more than it did for others. Just the wind. It depends what the weather is. Like the others said, could be some rain, which normally makes things more interesting. But I think we always have, at least in the race, a bit more of an advantage. But our main competitor over the last four, five races has been Charles and it's been the Ferrari. So, if there was anyone else that's going to be on pole today, it was going to be Charles. And if there's anyone that's going to make our life tough tomorrow, it's going to be the same guy. So yeah, we'll see. It's a long race, things can happen, and hopefully the rain can be on our side maybe.",Hungary,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"I think a bit of a combination of a few. I think the first lap overtake was crucial to winning the race, and I feel like I had a really good race start, especially considering it was a rolling start. So that's what really put me in a good place. And then I think managing the Mediums was important. The pace the whole weekend was really strong as well. Even going back before Sunday, it felt like a really strong weekend. I suppose so. Every weekend now, or the last few weekends anyway, it has been Lando and I. I expect our competition to still be strong and put up a good fight, especially at certain tracks through the rest of the year. Whether that comes from Max or Ferrari or Mercedes or someone else, we never really know. I'm not too concerned about what happens in that. I'm just trying to win each race and extend the lead. Clearly, Lando and I are in the same car, which is the best, and he's naturally going to be the close competition. I don't know. Hungary has been historically a good track for us as a team, certainly the two years I've been with the team. I expect us to be strong again this weekend. But there have been tracks this year where we thought we would be very strong compared to our competition and they were closer than we thought. And there have been other tracks where we thought our competition would be very close, and actually the gap was bigger than we thought. So, you never know, but I expect us to still be at the front. I still don't think they count as a real win, but yes, they are important. In the position that we're in as a team, there's often a lot more to lose in a sprint than there is to gain, because each position is one point. You don't really get rewarded for doing an amazing job in a Sprint event, but you get a pretty big penalty if it goes wrong. That's just what you have to deal with. Obviously, any points you can get, whether it's one point, two points, they will help. You just try and approach it like normal and try and do the best you can. I have a lot of confidence in myself that I can do it. Not every weekend has been perfect, but there's not many weekends in my whole life that have been perfect. Just trying to put together a solid, consistent year is ultimately going to be important. The pace in the last few weekends, especially Spa, I've been very confident in and very proud of. I'm more than capable of continuing that for the rest of the year. I'm confident that I can do it, but it's not going to be easy. I think Pierre summed it up very well. In the last few years, we've been giving our feedback to the FIA about what we think is acceptable and what's not. It is always much worse in the car than it looks on TV, and I think the FIA has done a very good job of listening to us and taking that feedback on board. We asked for them to be, if anything, on the conservative side. You could argue that we were, but we would much rather that than the opposite. The feeling in this room would be pretty different if we had a big crash last week. We'll work with the FIA and fine-tune that, but I think we're on the right side of cautious. Both, ideally. You can make an argument for either one. You can be consistent, but if you're consistently coming second, that's not very useful. You need to have both. At the level of the field and the level of my teammate, you need to bring your best. Inevitably, when you're pushing that hard, there are going to be mistakes here and there because it doesn't come without risk. You can't afford to take things easy and try and be consistent. You need to push and you need to be quick. Of course, you try and execute as best as you can, but you need both to win the championship. You can't just rely on one. Honestly, it's a very similar answer. The way you win races at the back end of the season is the same way as at the start. You need to be faster than everyone around you and you need to make the least mistakes possible. That aspect doesn't really change. Like I said, it's great to be consistent, but if you're consistently being beaten, that's not a recipe for a championship. It's a balancing act of both. Obviously, if you're a robot, you'd be able to be as fast as possible and make zero mistakes, but we're all humans, so that's not possible. There is going to be an element of minimizing mistakes, but you need to be fast at the same time, and you can't afford to sit back. If you try to take that approach, you'll end up being beaten. Not necessarily. Everybody knows the history of Senna and Prost and that rivalry, and other rivalries outside of McLaren. You don't really need an example to set the culture that we have at the moment. We're both very conscious that we want this opportunity of having the car and the team in this position for many years to come. The best way we can help as drivers apart from driving fast is by giving the team good morale and good confidence and making it a good team environment. That's very important for us this year and going forward. We've all seen how it can go wrong, but we have a lot of reasons to push for it to not go wrong. I mean, I don't fully get the question, but yes, we are free to fight this year at the moment. If we win the Constructors_. No , we've been free to race from race one. I've not seen much apart from where we're sat now, but it looks really nice from the outside. As long as it gives fans a better experience, then that's great. It's impressive that it's been done from one year to the next. It looks like it's been quite a big task, so well done. I think it underlined the good nature in the team. It was obviously a slightly awkward situation, but it highlighted that we will do the right thing in all circumstances when we're on track. It showed the trust that we have with the team and with each other as well, and that things will be put the right way. Developing a little bit in a lot of areas. Last year, I felt like I had some weekends that were very strong and felt like I had enough to win races on my good days. But there were a lot of average and sometimes bad days in between. This year has been full of a lot more good days. I have improved as a driver, but I think I've been able to get closer to what I think I'm capable of more often. That's been the biggest thing. It's not come from one specific area. It's come from looking at lots of different things. Being able to execute what I think is my best more and more often, that's been the difference.",Hungary,thursday,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"I think it's been, first, a positive weekend because we really had a strong car that was able to be fighting for the point scoring zones. We've maximised that Friday evening and Saturday morning, definitely, with the P5 finish and the P7 for Ollie. That was a really good haul of points. Unfortunately, we didn't optimize Saturday's quali and the race was even worse on our side. We know we have a quick car, but we need to align everything. That's the most important thing and we will try and do that this weekend. No reason why we shouldn't be able to perform. It's a track that I really enjoy, that I have great memories from. I'm looking forward to seeing what this car can do. Since the update, we really have been able to do a step forward in terms of where we position ourselves. Now, it__ easier said than done that we can get into the right zone. Qualifying is going to be super important, so we need to maximise that. And there could be some rain again. It's two races in a row where we didn't maximize our strategy and where we should have ended up higher. Hopefully the third one will be the good one. Going in the good direction, I would say. It hasn't been smooth the whole time, but we were able to get some weekends where we thought, okay, that was a really strong one. There was nothing we could have done better and there was a lot of learning. We started, clearly, as the last car in Australia, and we fought back in a magnificent way. The team was able to react to certain situations in a way that I felt it was a lost cause, and that wasn't the case. It's been great to see how much pride the team takes when we do certain results, and I'm really proud of everyone in the way we've been able to deliver and improve. We set ourselves in a good position now where it's a tight midfield, and we need to deliver every time we are out there, and that will make the difference at the end of the year. I can give an example. The first year I went to Spa was 2012 and I was at the back of the grid. It was a wet race. I couldn't see a thing, basically similar to what happened to Isack when he crashed into Kimi, except we were in Spa. I was P25 or something like that. I tried to look to the right to see if there was some clear vision ahead and no spray, and I backed off. I was maybe in fourth or fifth gear, probably like 160, 170. The moment I pulled to the right, I basically crossed the car that was parallel to the track and I just saw him when I crossed his path. If I was on the left, things would have been similar. I would have probably had a massive injury from that. I've been in those situations. It's not any fun. I think what the FIA did was the correct thing for Spa. We don't want to race in conditions where we are not able to see two metres ahead. It's calling for disaster to happen again. We've lost enough drivers in those kinds of conditions and that's not something we want to see. It's very impressive what the organization has been able to do. That grandstand is going to be fantastic to see full in the Grand Prix before we head to the track. There's always a lot of support around here. To see it being much bigger is going to be awesome. I think it will also facilitate the garage exit because it was always quite tight for us to get into the fast lane. I haven't seen yet the main straight, see how it's been resurfaced. I could not recognize the paddock, which is quite impressive from one year to another. Realistically, no. That__ the real answer. Obviously, that opens up opportunities in this kind of weather. We've been the last two races on the wrong side of things, not going in the right direction to move forward in the race. It's a good thing for the show and for us to suddenly take the opportunity to score points. We'll see how things go, but Budapest always brings interesting races.",Hungary,thursday,Haas
Pierre Gasly,"It's been two good races for us. The conditions made it_ kind of shuffled the order a bit. The rain came in Silverstone, we made the right calls, and as a team we're really doing a good job with the package we have. Might not have the best performance, but whatever we have at the moment, the last few weekends we've been able to really get everything out of it and make the best out of the conditions. In Silverstone and Spa, great strategy, all the right calls. I'm pleased in the way we're operating with the team. Obviously, I'd like a bit more performance, but that's what we have and we battle with this car. I'm very pleased, but it's the team's been able to really provide me with the car I need to feel confident, be comfortable at the limit. It's quite good because it's a tough season. The performance is not quite there, but everyone is really motivated to put our best game and really try to nail every single weekend. Sometimes it might be good enough for 14th, 12th. We are not pleased about the end result, but we always try. With that mindset and mentality, it gave us a P6 and a P10 in Spa. We've got to keep trying and make the best out of this second part of the year. It's really clear. He's been a very long time working in Renault. He knows the DNA of the group, of the team. He's been part of it for all these years when Renault has been part of Formula 1. He's fully committed to the sport, to the Formula 1 team. Obviously wants to see performance, and he's backing everybody in the team. Looking forward to the future with the team. We know where we're heading. We know '25 is a compromise we decided to take at the start of the year to focus on '26. Hopefully, it's going to pay dividends next year. The reality of it is the car has been the same since Barcelona and will remain the same until the end of the year. On one side, you've got to be objective and realistic on what's achievable. Steve will arrive in September, and I think his impact and his work will be mainly seen on 2026 and beyond. Honestly, Steve's got to focus on next year. We know all the work that we are putting for 2026. We are pleased with what we are doing and the evolution. I'm confident. I believe in the team and the fact that they'll be able to give me a competitive car next year. The reality of it is this season, this is what we have, and it's going to be extremely difficult to change the position that we are in. It doesn't mean we are doing a bad job at the track or back at the factory. We just haven't been able to produce a car, in a season where the midfield is extremely tight, with the decisions we've made for '26. We haven't been able to provide enough performance to fight for better than that, which is fine because at the end of the day, whether you finish ninth or eighth or tenth in the championship, you're still fighting for nothing pretty much. But if it gives you a car that can fight for race wins, podiums, top five next season, I'll take that every day of the week. It's always easier to explain why you've been too conservative than explaining why you've put the drivers in dangerous conditions. At Silverstone, we saw a driver hitting another car from not seeing where it was going, which to me has nothing to do with racing. We want to see overtaking. We want to see skills out there in the wet, not a race decided on whether you see what's going on two meters in front of your car. Spa, they said before the weekend, they'd probably be more conservative knowing what happened in Silverstone and knowing the history of the racetrack. Were they on the conservative side? Yes. Can we complain that they were conservative? I don't think so. Can we work with them to help them make a slightly more precise judgment and increase the show and the driving on track in these conditions? Sure thing. I'm sure we're going to talk about it in the Drivers' Briefing and next race they'll do even better and we'll find the right adjustment. I don't think it's fair to say they've done a bad job. It__ explainable. They were on the safer side this time. We'll work on that. Us drivers, we want to drive on the wet. We're fine with it. It's always exciting. You don't want to end up in a situation where you don't see and you end up crashing in the middle of the Kemmel straight and having another incident you need to explain to another family. It's a fine line and we will work on it with the FIA and I'm sure it's going to get better over time. Just to make sure I understood the question, you're saying whether it's a car issue type of thing? We know the spray is definitely not great with these cars. There's been quite a lot of testing going on to reduce the spray from a tyre point of view, like a wheel cover, etc. I'm not too sure where we are at, but moving forward, we definitely need to find a way to reduce that spray, which then will allow us to race in wet conditions. At the moment, when the visibility is fine, there's no need for the wet tyre. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg kind of thing and they need to work on that. Looks beautiful. Same.",Hungary,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"I'm really, really happy. It's not that it's coming as a surprise, but I'm really happy. Especially in the past month, there were quite a few rumours, like it's always the case around the team. To finally have the official news out is important and I'm really happy. Without going into comparing the different eras, Fred has an incredible vision. What's very difficult within Ferrari is the emotion is very much part of the daily job because Italian people in general, and that's what makes Ferrari so special, are extremely passionate about Ferrari. Fred really knows how to leave his emotions aside and have a clear vision of where we are at no matter how much noise there is around the team. This is very, very important. Apart from that, he's got many more qualities. One of them is also to extract the maximum out of every single person at the factory and this, when you put everything together, it makes a big difference. The result will say so. We've had four podiums in the last six race weekends. I don't think yet that we are at the level where we can say that we are the second strongest team on the grid. But we are working towards that and making steps in the right direction. There have been quite a few upgrades in the last few weekends which helped us to close the gap to the guys in front. However, this weekend, I'm not sure. It's by far the worst track of the season for me. I'm looking forward to trying to prove that wrong and to have finally a good weekend here in Budapest. I don't know. I wish I knew. It's just not been very successful for me in the past. It's probably something with my driving style. I've got to work a little bit harder compared to other tracks, but that's fine. Maybe it's the walls that are missing. I don't know where it's coming from, but I'm still confident we can have a great weekend and we'll see how it goes. When I worked with Laurent, he wasn't a team principal just yet. He had a very important position within the team. Laurent has always been extremely good at understanding people. He's one of those where I didn__ have to speak much for him to understand the way I felt. That__ always very helpful. I've never had him as my team principal, but I've always seen him as a person definitely capable of becoming one. It__ great to see what__ happening to him. I__ super happy for him, when he first made the step to AlphaTauri back then and now at Red Bull Racing. He definitely deserves that. I didn't have much expectation because I didn't know. As a driver, you watch the data of other drivers, but there__ always the question mark: when you're off in one corner, how much is it coming from the driver and how much from the car? I was very curious to see where I would be against Lewis. Again, it's still very early on and we're also not fighting for wins and pole positions, which changes things for a driver. For now, my only focus is to try and bring Ferrari back to the top. I'm happy with the way I'm performing and I just need to keep going that way. It's probably too early to judge, as it's a new team for Lewis, and I'm sure he's still understanding and learning about all the different systems, the new systems for him. I'm not the one making the decisions, but I think stability is always very important. Fred is the person we look up to and the person leading the team. To have him for many more years is definitely a good thing, also because in Formula 1 it takes time to build something, especially a successful team. I'm very happy about that. Knowing that I'll be able to have Fred alongside me for more years makes me optimistic for the future. No, don't worry, I'm of course involved. I'm not creating documents on my side, but I'm definitely having meetings whenever I'm back in Maranello with the team to know what is the next thing we want to tackle as a team. Every single driver has their way of feeding back the team. I have my way, which is different compared to Lewis, but that doesn't mean I'm left out. I'm definitely involved in the process. Fred is definitely part of it, but the biggest part is to see how the team works. I'm sure we are working in the right direction. Next year will be a big turning point for us as it will be a new era of cars. Whenever you start a new era, if you are not starting it on the right foot, it's always more difficult to come back because other teams are also pushing for upgrades. To close the gap is very difficult. We'll have to start that on the right foot and then we'll see. For now, I'm fully dedicated to try and make Ferrari great again and to win races again. He definitely changed the way we are working on different things. Where Fred made the biggest difference is his vision, his overall vision. This, he embedded it into the team and that's very important. I feel that the beauty of Ferrari is the fact that emotionally it's always intense, but it can also harm us in some ways, especially when tougher times arrive. Fred has always had very cold blood in those moments and helped the team to be a little bit more, lucid _ do you say that in English? Yes? OK. And that__ the biggest thing Fred has brought to the team. Definitely. The fact that there was so much hype around the team at the beginning of the year made everything worse. When we then started the season, I think everybody thought we were going to win the championship and unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Then there were rumours and that took a bigger proportion than what we want. These are not things we can control. As I was saying earlier, it's part of Ferrari. It's always been the case and it will never change. We cannot focus on that. The best thing we can do is try and not think about those things as much as possible. In terms of my own performance, as I was saying, I'm very happy with the way I perform. The best moment as a driver, no, because I want to win. So, as my own performance, I'm really happy. You always want to improve and obviously, like Silverstone for example, was a very poor weekend from my side. Those weekends you want to have the least possible in a season. Apart from that, I'm very satisfied. That is a good thing. I also think the upgrades go in the right direction of making the life of the drivers, Lewis and myself, a little bit easier because at the beginning of the season, it was extremely difficult. We had to set up the car in very extreme ways and that made us also do more mistakes. Now we are a bit more in a reasonable window, which helps us to extract the maximum out of the car. It__ good that we see the result. He's definitely very funny. I'm sure it plays a part in the team. We've got some very funny guys within the team as well. However, we are obviously here to work. It helps. Whenever we have team dinners, we are having a good time, and it really feels like a family. For me, it definitely feels like a family. I've been growing up in Ferrari basically and I'm still there. Fred has integrated into the team extremely well. Now he's leading it with his sense of humour as well, which sometimes can lighten some difficult situations. Again, I'm really happy about Fred's reconfirmation within the team. I'm pretty sure it's better to finish second than third. However, as you said, there's also the wind tunnel time. This is not something we think of too much. When we are on track, we just want to finish as high up as possible and then we'll deal with whatever amount of hours in the wind tunnel we have. We want to target the highest possible. Second place in the Constructors_ is one of our targets, but the biggest target is to come back to winning races as soon as possible. Wherever we finish, we'll work from there and see how many hours we have next year. I'm not sure. I don't think there's one track at the moment where we think we are stronger than McLaren. Consistently, McLaren is going to be the strongest car this year. Red Bull is a little bit more up and down, a bit like us and Mercedes, but there's one constant and that is McLaren. For now, I don't think there's any tracks where I go to and think we will be the favourite, but I hope I'll be surprised. I agree. It's maybe a bit extreme to say that only the McLaren drivers will be having fun. We are all fighting for something. It would be very optimistic for me to say that I'm fighting for the World Championship. That__ not realistic anymore. However, we are fighting for coming back to winning races. For that, I'm very excited and I just hope it will be as soon as possible. I'm still fully motivated and excited whenever there's a race.",Hungary,thursday,Ferrari
Lance Stroll,"We're not as competitive as we want to be, that__ for sure. As a team, we want to be fighting further up and scoring more points every weekend. Spa was a difficult weekend for us, just not fast enough. There's a lot of work going on back at Silverstone to keep pushing, keep making the car faster. Some fun races for sure this season, some fun wet races where we capitalised on opportunities and scored some points. Those ones tasted good, but we want to be faster. At the moment, it feels like it. On a normal dry weekend, maybe if the track suits the car perfectly and we get everything out of it, we can snag a point or two. But it feels like a lot of the time, it's those kinds of weekends that we're relying on to mix things up and get something out of it. I don't know. I hope so. We'll see. As a team, probably all teams now are heavily focused on next year. With the new regulations, it's going to be a big opportunity for everyone. It's definitely a very exciting time for us as a team, with all the tools we have: the new wind tunnel, new simulator, a lot of people joining the team, Adrian coming on board. It's a very exciting time for us. No one knows where they will stand at the first race in Melbourne, but a lot of work and focus is going into '26. For sure, it's going to be more exciting for the McLaren drivers than the rest of us. But every race you never know what's going to happen. We're all in our own different battles. Some of us are trying to pick up a point or two and that's a victory for us as a team. McLaren are fighting to win the race every weekend. We're all fighting our own battles. I'm enjoying every weekend as they come and you never know what's going to happen. The future, next year, like I said earlier, is a big opportunity for all the teams. That's exciting to see how it's going to fall into place. You mean like the conditions and stuff? I think the cars have gotten big, the tyres have gotten bigger, the spray has gotten worse over the years. That's my feeling. Visibility is the biggest issue now with the size of the cars and the tyres. Races like Spa with the nature of the track, Eau Rouge, going 300 kilometres per hour without seeing anything at the top of the hill__acing conditions like that are hard to go through with and then go racing. I don't know if it's gotten worse. It's always been challenging. The spray is the biggest issue and the visibility. To go ahead with races like Spa, start earlier and race in proper wet conditions, we need to work on the visibility factor and how we can improve that.",Hungary,thursday,Aston Martin
Liam Lawson,"Probably not, to be honest. It's always tricky in those conditions when it's changing. In the car it felt like it was still quite wet when everyone was putting on slicks. We were actually one of the early cars to do it. If they'd asked me if I thought it was ready, I probably would have said no. Those races are very tricky to judge. For us, we were able to capitalise. In general, the car has been quick recently. On most tracks we've been to, practice has been quite strong and I feel like we've started in a good place and not had too much to work on. It's just very close right now. Even in Spa, I couldn't believe that over a nearly two-minute lap, for teams to be within one tenth in qualifying, it's very close. I think Austria was a more complete weekend in terms of qualifying was maximized, race was maximized. I don't think we could have achieved too much more. In Spa the car was quick, qualifying wasn't perfect, and going into the race we were able to capitalize. It's just been more consistent recently. There needs to be more because to have two good races like that in what's been 12 races is not enough. We need to be doing it nearly every weekend if that's the target. It's been busy. It's been a whirlwind, especially at the start of the year. Very unexpected, and what was probably a rocky start has now stabilised and we're in a better place. The speed's been there most of the year, and it's nice that we're finally able to get a couple of good results. As a whole, we need to be doing that more. To have two or three of those races over the first half of the season is not enough. Going forward into the second half of the year, we're trying to replicate this more. Right now, with how close it is, it's the little things that make a big difference. Trying to extract everything each weekend. Charles said it very well. He's a people person. When he came to us, he straightaway led the team. He's very personal with you, very open to talking on a personal level, especially with me as a driver and to everybody in the team. He was somebody that was easy to follow. He__ probably one of my favourite guys in the paddock, honestly. He__ just a very good person, beautiful family. Always working very hard as well, one of the guys there on Thursday mornings before most people, pushing very hard. Very cool to see. If I was to just pick an area, overall, it's qualifying. With how important it is at the moment because everybody's very close, even on tracks that are maybe easier to overtake, it's still difficult because you don't have a three, four, five tenth pace advantage. You have like a one or two tenth pace advantage, and that's very hard to overtake. Qualifying is very important, it sets up your weekend. Where our weekends have fallen away, at least on my side, has been normally in an average qualifying. Where our weekends have been strong, it's when we qualify well. That's the main target: just extracting everything, making sure we have the car in the best place going into qualifying, and then for me getting everything out of it and doing a better job. These guys said it well. With how close the midfield is right now, it's definitely exciting from our perspective depending on how the weekends are going. We're all on our own path and in our own fights. We're all focused on those individual things at the moment.",Hungary,thursday,RB
Charles Leclerc,"Max was behind the whole race within two seconds, so it's never easy. But I knew that the first part of the race was the trickiest one for us because we maybe didn't have the downforce that McLaren or Max had, as they compromised a little bit in qualifying to be better in the rain today. But luckily, it dried up pretty quickly and then the pace was good. But still, Max was right behind the whole race, so I'm pretty happy that we managed to keep that third place. I mean, obviously the pressure is high, especially in those conditions because as soon as you are ten, 15 centimetres out of the right line, then it's wet or greasy and you can lose the line and make a very big mistake. So, at one point I just told Bryan to leave me alone, but obviously he's trying to give me the most information. Sometimes I need them, today I didn__ and I let him know. I hope so. Honestly, we've had what we expected with this upgrade and that's really positive. We need to keep learning about how to maximise this new upgrade. It's still pretty new, but it's a good first weekend and I'm happy that we are on the podium to thank the whole team back in Maranello. We keep pushing and hopefully we'll put soon a bit more pressure on the McLarens. It's nice. I don't think we expected it, especially after the Sprint Qualifying when I saw the gap with the top three. I was like, okay, it's going to be probably the best we can do this weekend. Yesterday, we did a really good lap. We did take a little bit of a gamble with the lower downforce compared to people around us, and then the rain today was tricky. The first part of the race was very difficult and Max definitely was faster than me. I had to keep him behind there, which we did. Once we went on the slicks, things came a bit more towards me. I just knew I had to do the job and P3 could be ours, which at the end it is, and I'm very happy. In the wet, probably. He was very, very close to me, but he never actually made it, which is great. The gap was always exactly the same. Sometimes I was doing a really good lap, and then I would look at the gap and he would do exactly the same lap. I was like, fuck, okay, so I just need to keep that pace now. Until the very end, he was very close to me. I'm pleased with the steps forward we are doing, and I think we should all be proud about that because I know that behind that, there's a lot of work behind the scenes from the people back at home for us to have this upgrade here. It definitely helped us to get the podium when you see how close it was with Max today. However, we are all aware that this is not enough, and we need to keep pushing in order to be closer to the McLaren. This is very clear for the whole team. It doesn't change that we shall be satisfied with what we've done this weekend. I'm not sure. I will rather wait before exposing myself. At the beginning of the race, I think it would have been very unlikely that we would stand on the podium if it was a full wet race, especially with the amount of downforce we had. It was very difficult to actually make those tyres work. Luckily for us, it dried up pretty quickly, and then the car became nice again to drive. Before that, it was difficult. I also had that in mind yesterday in qualifying and probably didn't go as extreme as I normally used to in terms of setup for the dry, which also probably helped for the first part of the race today. I think it's always fine-tuning. On a track like this with what happened historically, I think you cannot forget about it. For that reason, I'd rather be safe than too early. It's a constant discussion, and we'll probably feed the people that made this decision back that maybe it was a little bit on the late side, but I wouldn't have changed anything.",Belgium,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Yeah. I mean Oscar just did a good job. Nothing more to say. Committed a bit more through Eau Rouge and had a slipstream and got the run. Nothing to complain of. He did a better job in the beginning and that was it. Nothing more I could do after that point. I would love to be up top but Oscar deserved it today. It__ __houlda, woulda, coulda_, so I__ not going to_ Oscar deserved it. I__ sure he made a couple mistakes. So if he drove a perfect race_ I couldn__ have won today. I__l review my things, but I__ so happy for the team. Another one-two. I think our first one-two here for many, many years. Nice to bring that back to the team. A well-deserved result for them and for Oscar too. Yes. Budapest is one of the best ones for me in terms of what I've done there in the past years and it's where I started my Formula 1 career. Always good memories. Normally one that suits me a bit better than Spa. Happy with today. Slightly disappointed but looking forward to next week. I don't know. It's hard. I didn't have the best Turn 1, so hard to know how much that played a part. At the same time, Oscar came past me pretty easily. So even if I had a better Turn 1, his run and the slipstream probably still would have got me. Not too disappointed. Of course disappointed to finish second. When you saw Saturday and you saw today, then P1 didn't look the best place to begin with. I also didn't get the best Turn 1, so I need to look at what I could have done better. I need to look at it with the team. I don't know. I wasn't. Will said, do I want the Hard tyre? And I said yes. That was about it. I didn't even know Oscar was on the Medium, to be honest with you. That didn't influence my decision. I thought the Hard tyre would be a slightly better tyre to the end, a bit trickier to get warmed up and the opening laps maybe would be a little bit more of a struggle, which I think it was. The last few laps, I had the advantage in terms of grip, but it was not a great pit stop, I was the second one to stop. I think I lost eight, nine seconds just by being the second car to box. To catch Oscar from that gap is quite an achievement. I gave it a good shot, but just not close enough. I need to ask the team. It's tough because you're going to lose quite a good chunk of time doing that as well. Considering the slick tyre was so much better by that point_ like Oscar said, it was a late call for us to box on that lap. I think if we review it, we probably would have kicked ourselves a little bit for staying out as long as we did. I think there was enough evidence that we should have boxed early, but no one boxed that early. It was just Lewis that boxed one lap earlier than us. It was just more painful for me that Oscar got the good lap. I had to go one lap longer. That's life. Same.",Belgium,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Lively. Very lively. I knew that lap one was going to be probably my best chance of winning the race. I got a good exit out of Turn 1 and lifted as little as I dared through Eau Rouge and that was enough. The rest of the race we managed really well. Struggling a little bit at the end, maybe the Medium wasn__ the best for the last five or six laps, but we had it mostly under control, which is what I wanted. I was pretty disappointed with myself after yesterday but turns out starting second at Spa is not too bad after all. Once I knew I was close_ To be honest I was a bit disappointed it was a rolling start because I thought that was going to take away some opportunity. But I got a good exit out of Turn 1, was able to stay close. When I was that close, I knew that I was just going to lift a little bit less than Lando did and try and keep it on the track. A bit lively up over the hill but managed to make it stick. From there, the tow helped me out. Proud of my first lap. I kind of had the same plan if I was going to be second. I knew that was going to be a likely decision for him. For me, the Medium was the safest tyre to be on at that point. You never know if someone's going to crash and there's a Safety Car, and then you want a Medium for the restart. Also, the Medium seemed pretty good in the Sprint yesterday. I think it didn__ make too much difference, but when you're fighting like that one-two, you're always going to try and get an advantage in one way or another. I think we did the safest thing. Definitely. It's going to be exciting to go back. It's a track I enjoy. Yeah, scene of my first win last year, I__ looking forward to getting back and hopefully we can continue the momentum because this weekend the pace has been incredibly strong. It was a tough race. Difficult conditions at the start and then just trying to manage the Inters firstly because it was drying relatively quickly, but you can kill the Inters in a lap or two if you really want around here. So that was a bit tricky. And then I felt good on the Mediums for about five laps, and then when I could see that the Hard on Lando's car was not worse than the Medium, I was a bit nervous considering we had nearly 25 laps to go at that point. So, I had to be a bit careful, but it held on in the end much better than I feared. I had to manage a bit, but nothing special. We'd spoken about it before the race. It was quite a late decision to pit on the lap we did, but there's risks either way. If I was in Lando's position, I probably would have done the same thing. At that point, it seemed like the safest thing to do was go on the Medium, because the Hard is two steps harder here. You don't know how it's going to react in those conditions. If there's a Safety Car, which often there is in those conditions, then you probably want a Medium, not a Hard. There are risks both ways, but ultimately I'm happy with what we did. I knew it was going to help me pretty significantly if I did. I had a good run out of Turn 1 and then tried to be as brave as I could through Eau Rouge and was able to stay pretty close. After that, the slipstream did the rest for me. I knew that was going to be pretty important for trying to win the race today. I'm really excited to go back. It's always a fun weekend. It's a great city, a cool track as well. I'm sure Thursday will be nice to go back to where I had my first win. But as soon as we get on track, you forget about that immediately. It'll be cool, but I'll enjoy today for a bit first. It's the first race outside of Australia that he's come to. One of my sisters, in Spain, that was her first race outside of Australia, and that was a good weekend. Now my grandfather the same, so maybe I need to get my family members one by one for the rest of the races. I didn't know. It seemed like the best person to dedicate it to. It's a nice thing to do. I had a good restart in general. I was close into the last chicane, had an okay run out of the last chicane and then a good exit out of Turn 1. The move through Eau Rouge, I knew it was going to be by far my best opportunity to try and win the race. I'd been thinking about it for a while, put it that way. Obviously, in those conditions, it's a little bit more difficult than if it's dry. I knew that I had to try and do that. When I watched the onboard back, it didn't look quite as scary as it felt in the car. I knew that I had to be very committed to pull that off. I think the past few years, particularly here, we've given the FIA feedback that we would much rather be on the safe side than risk anything. I think that's what we did today. If you were to be picky, maybe we could have done one less formation lap. But in the grand scheme of things, if that's one lap too early, is it worth it? No. Also, us three are the worst people to ask because we have the least amount of cars in front of us. For someone at the back, the first time we tried to start the race, even for myself with just Lando ahead, I couldn't see a thing. You can only imagine what it's like for the guys at the back. That's always a tough thing to balance because the guys at the front have an easier time than the guys at the back.",Belgium,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Not really [I did not see it coming]. I mean, I'm very happy today. It's strange to say that because it's still three tenths and it's only a third place, but I did not expect it. We thought we were quite a lot more back. We knew that we had something more in the car obviously with the upgrade this weekend, but we still struggled yesterday. But that was a really, really good lap. I'm very happy with the lap, very happy how the car felt. So, it's good that we put everything together for quali. No. I mean, obviously it takes a little bit of time to maximise those upgrades that we put on the car. So, there were a few things that we've changed, but nothing major. It was all about putting everything together and I felt comfortable with the car since FP1. So, it's good to have a qualifying where you look back and you know you haven't left anything on the table. I don't know yet. For sure the race pace looked very strong this morning. I couldn't keep up with them. But again, with the small changes we've done, I hope that this gives us the upper hand tomorrow in the main race. Quite big. I think we expected to be P4, but with a significant gap in front. At the end, the gap is still significant, but a little bit less than what we initially expected, so that's positive. We brought upgrades this weekend which have been working since the beginning, but we had to do some fine tunings from yesterday to today. It's going in the right direction, so I'm very happy. I think it was also a really good lap. I don't think I left much on the table with the potential we had today, so for that, I'm happy as well. However, it's only P3, so now we'll see what we can do tomorrow. A little bit. But then I think as always, especially for our team, everything is hyped up a lot. Yes, it's an upgrade and it's a step in the right direction, but we are still speaking about very fine differences over a whole lap. So, it feels a little bit different, and it's going in the right direction. Again, that's thanks to the hard work that the whole team has done back at the factory. Unfortunately for us, McLaren has also brought a few things this weekend and seem to have done a small step in the right direction as well. So, it's very difficult to close the gap. But I think we are doing a good job as a team and we just need to keep working. Wet weather, we were speaking about it in the last race weekend. I don't think it's a strength for our car at the moment. We are really struggling. But having said that, every weekend is different. We'll learn from the past and see what's possible tomorrow. I will only be able to tell after the first few laps to see where we are. But I'll try to look forward before looking in mirrors. Yes and no. I think it's definitely going in the right direction once again as I was saying. However, compared to the McLaren, I think we are probably on average three or four tenths behind in qualifying. We__l do a step forward. I don't think though that we'll find those three or four tenths in that upgrade. But it will help us to get closer. The more we use it, the more we'll be able to maximize this and there'll be some more potential to gain. But no, I don't think it's enough to be able to challenge the McLaren consistently from now on. It's a little bit better. I think that's what helped me also a little bit this weekend to be a bit more consistent. The lap times in qualifying, both yesterday in Sprint Qualifying and today, came together a bit easier. That's been my strength normally, but this year I've been struggling a little bit more to put everything together in qualifying. This weekend seems to be better, but we just need to prove that over multiple race weekends because it's also_ I mean, the grip this weekend here is incredible. There's so much grip _ but that's not only for us, but I also think for everybody. Generally, this makes it easier. So, we'll have to prove that on a track that is a bit trickier.",2025 Belgium Grand Prix,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"A bit disappointing, yes. The second lap was coming together really well and just made a little mistake into 14 and lost a lot of time. So yeah, disappointed. Felt like the car was very good again, but it's fine margins out there. Obviously not a bad place to be starting, but I think there was more in it which is always disappointing. I don't know. I mean, I think we're a good team-mate pairing and we learn a lot from each other every weekend. That's what makes us such a good team but it also makes it difficult when you're trying to fight each other. So, I don't know. I feel like I did an okay job today, just didn't quite execute when it mattered and yeah, a bit of a shame. Yeah. I mean after the Sprint I was aiming for P2. I don't know what the weather's going to hold tomorrow. I think it's going to be quite different. So, we'll wait and see what we get. But yeah, try and have a good race. A lot. Enough. I think so, yeah. The lap until that point was strong, but it doesn't really matter if you could have done it. I didn't. A bit disappointing. I think both laps in Q3 were a little bit like that, but that's how it goes sometimes. A bit of a shame, but the car was great again. I felt like I was in a reasonably good flow. Just didn't quite happen on the second lap. Not really, no. In all honesty, it felt very similar. You get a few more laps on softs, you
explore the limits a bit more, you push the limit a bit more maybe, and today that probably bit. But it still felt very good. I had just as much confidence as yesterday, so it definitely wasn't that. Let's see. If it's dry, then yes. If it's wet, then it obviously adds in some other challenges, but we'll have to wait and see what the weather does first. I know what I'm hoping for. Didn't change it either. In the dry, potentially. But there have also been times where pole has maintained the lead _ unfortunately, not this morning. It's probably the hardest track to maintain the lead on the calendar from the start. If the weather is wet though, I think pole position is an advantage, but it also depends on how wet it is. Whether Eau Rouge is flat or not makes a big difference.",2025 Belgium Grand Prix,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Which one? Oh, I don't know. Can't remember. I mean it was a decent lap, of course. So yeah, happy. I don't know. Everyone was pretty worried after yesterday. I wasn't even that far off. It was just a couple little issues that we had. So, I was confident after yesterday and confident coming into today. It's nice to see that I could get back to the top. Three tenths is just slipstream and not being first out the pit lane. So yeah, it was nothing to worry about. People like to make a lot of things up but no, I felt good. The car has been flying all weekend. Oscar's been doing a good job all weekend. So, we're pushing each other a lot like you said. It's tough because you kind of see where your strengths and weaknesses are easily and you learn from each other quickly. So, it's a good but tough battle that we have at the minute. I mean I prefer it to stay dry honestly. Even for the fans. I think it's rained here for like the last ten years or something. So, it'd be nice to have a dry Sunday. But I don't mind whether it's dry or rain or whatever it is or somewhere in the middle. It's normal here and I look forward to a fun race. Yeah. Obviously, good enough for pole. I felt like my second one, I improved, just the lap time didn't. So maybe a little bit more out there, but I think nice improvement from yesterday. Just nice to be in a better position in the pack and be out there again. So, a good day. The car's been feeling great all weekend, so it's nice to have a one-two. No. I just think there were a couple of corners that I must have gone slower, I guess. I don't know why. I don't see if I'm going quicker or not on my lap. Maybe Turn 1, I hit the kerb a little bit, and it's a long run after Turn 1, so probably cost myself a little bit there. And the last corner, a bit too much kerb in both of them, and I probably lost, I mean, we're talking half a tenth, touch more, and I go slower. We're talking small margins, but yeah, that's it. I think what feels nice here quite often is just when you put a new set of tyres on, it's a good step of grip. There__ not more pressure it just feels like you can push that 1-2% more, and that's always a good feeling. You have Turn 9, 5-6-7, you have Pouhon, 12-13, all corners which are pretty damn quick. You try to get that balance perfect with the car, getting the lifts right. A lot of it's about timings and just getting things nailed in terms of timing. It's a fun track. No matter how good you do, you always go into the last chicane and think, __kay, just get this bit right_. It's a fun track in any car. I've driven here since Formula 4, quite a bit slower in that, but in Formula 1, it's good fun. It always puts a smile on your face during qualifying, especially when you can be on top. It's probably going to rain. I don't know much more than that. We'll wait and see. It's Spa, so high chance of rain, but that can also mean it just sometimes hits half the track and the other half stays dry. Could be in for a Silverstone-esque chaotic race, similar to Australia or Silverstone, the ones that are sometimes a bit in the middle. Most likely some rain and drizzle. Hard to know. We're going off the front, so hopefully, I can make an advantage of that and clean air and go from there. I think we have the best car, so that's the most important thing. No. No. I think as soon as you start to bring in some strategy and tyre differences, especially with the C1 to the C3, C4 jump, I definitely expect more racing if it was to be dry tomorrow. The tricky thing is you're talking about the field being more compact than ever, which puts on a good show in qualifying and things are tight and thrilling and great to watch. But that often just makes it trickier at times for the racing. The gaps are smaller, you can make smaller differences from car to car and driver to driver. So, there are pros and cons in everything. The more we develop these cars, generally the trickier it becomes to overtake and to follow as well. It's never an easy one to get right. But I'm sure if it was a dry race tomorrow, I'd expect more racing. I don't expect it to be dry, so I expect just more racing and more chaos anyway. But I think sometimes there are some Sprints every now and then that are like that because everyone's pushing a bit more flat out through the race. You're thinking less of strategy. You're not thinking of doing a one or two-stop. So, we'll wait and find out.",2025 Belgium Grand Prix,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah. I mean, not a lot going on. Obviously, a bit of fun at the start with trying to overtake Charles. Maybe could have positioned myself a little bit better but otherwise a bit too difficult to get past Max. Max drove a good race and I wasn't going to get past anyone unless Oscar got past Max. They drove good races. Not a lot we could do on a day like today, so looking forward to tomorrow. Yeah. It's tough. Obviously, I hope for a bit of battling or something but the Red Bull was just too quick on the straight for us to catch up. Maybe some tweaks for us to make into qualifying, I don't know. We'll reassess and see what we can do. This is the plan. I'm not too fussed about Sprint races, but obviously main races I prefer to win. We'll see. I wasn't too bad yesterday. I was comfortable, just a couple things didn't go my way. But I'm confident we can have a good result later and put in some good quality laps. Thank you. The same as what I had before. Like Oscar said, I think we knew we would find it tough to pass Max if he got ahead at the beginning. I got past Charles and from then it was just kind of a bit of a waiting game to see if anything happened, but nothing did. So I had confidence before that we would be quick. But here, you still need to be a bit quicker in this race than what we were today. Difficult. I think we probably have a quicker car altogether, but just not enough to overtake. I don__ know. Impressive. I don__ know. The tyres are nowhere near good enough at the end, so I don__ know if he just had some clearer air or something. I don__ think that means anything. We__l see. We__e just got qualifying ahead now, and then we__l wait and see what the weather makes us do tomorrow.",Belgium,post-sprint,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Pretty much, yeah. I tried my best to snake my way through the straights and not give too much of a tow but I just didn't have enough straight-line speed and then obviously didn't have enough straight-line speed for the next 15 laps either. Still a good result, still good points. It is only the Sprint, the main points are tomorrow. Pretty happy with it but just a bit frustrating that I couldn't get past. It's a great question. The weather is looking pretty bad for tomorrow, which obviously means you probably don't want to take off too much wing, but I don't really want to repeat the Sprint we've just had. We'll have a look, see what we can do. There's a lot of things to look into before tomorrow. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. Spa is my favourite track of the year and especially in qualifying it's just mega around here. Looking forward to some more laps this afternoon. Thanks. Realistically, not that close. I think there was one or two times where I got within a car length but the problem is I didn__ have enough. And Turn 5 is not really a corner where you can make a lunge on someone. Once they defend the inside, it__ difficult to do anything. So I think realistically I was going to have to try and get past on the straight, which we were no chance of doing. A little bit frustrating, but we knew that was a possibility going into the Sprint and I was prepared for maybe not to be within eight tenths the whole race and not be able to do anything, but for this kind of result. Not necessarily. I was hoping we would be super quick in the middle sector and be able to hang on, but I think I could for the first part of the race. But spending that much time right behind someone, you overheat the tyres very quickly. Especially around here, they deg as well. It__ not just getting hot. I think the back end of the race I lost some of the advantage in the middle sector that I had and obviously you don__ gain anything more on the straight. So realistically I don__ think we had quite enough to even get close enough, but we__l see what we can do for qualifying. I don__ know yet. We__l wait and see. If it is wet, then naturally you want a bit more downforce, but if it__ not wet, then I don__ really want a repeat of the sprint race we__e just had. So we__l have a look for sure, but it__l be interesting to see if anyone changes and which way we go. I think it was probably a little bit better than I expected, but I wasn__ expecting Max to be slow, that__ for sure. I knew it was going to be a challenge, maybe not quite as difficult as it was, but I think, like I said before, after following so closely for so long, the tyres just naturally get to a point where they can__ do much anymore, and it__ a bit of an equaliser. So, it wasn__ a big surprise for me. I was trying. I was definitely trying. It__ difficult because you want to save the battery at some points, you want to use it at some points, but you also don__ want to drop too far back and give yourself too much of a gap to actually close up to because it wasn__ as simple as just getting DRS and then letting DRS do the rest. You had to be even closer than that. That was tricky, but I certainly tried in those 15 laps, but to no avail.",Belgium,post-sprint,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. It worked out really well. That's the only real opportunity you're going to get against them and we got it into Turn 5. Then I knew it was going to be very tough to keep them behind. It was just playing cat and mouse, DRS, battery usage. The whole race was within seven tenths. I couldn't really afford to make big mistakes. I had one tiny lock-up in the last corner but apart from that it was a great result to keep them behind and to have a win here in Spa. Of course it's a Sprint win but it still counts and I'm very happy with what we did out there. Basically, you're keeping faster cars behind so you have to drive over the limit of what you think is possible. Tyre management is out of the window so that is what makes it really difficult. I'm just doing 15 qualifying laps to try and keep them behind on a track where tyre management is important. It wasn't easy but we managed to do it so I'm very happy with that. Do I feel pole is possible? I'm not sure but we'll try our best, try and set up the car how we want. After this race we'll have a few more ideas of what we want to do and then try to be as close as possible to them. Yeah, I__ just happy that I was able to hang on to it. I knew, of course, in the start there were possibilities up to Turn 5. We took it. And then, from there onwards, I knew also they had new Mediums. I knew that it was going to be even more difficult. Just trying to hang in there with the top speed that we had. I knew the middle sector was going to be the weaker area for us and just trying not to make any mistakes there, basically. And it worked very well. The only thing that I had was one time the braking into the last chicane. But it__ also, you know, you__e driving a bit over your own kind of management, so it__ easy to just overheat the tyres a bit too much. But we hung in there and kept the two McLarens behind. Of course, very pleased to win here. I mean, it__ my favourite track, home crowd, home feeling. So, yeah, just very nice always to be here. No. I knew that we had a little bit of a pace advantage on the straight. So, as soon as we got out of Turn 1, I knew that I would have a run to Turn 5. Need to have a look. Silverstone wasn__ particularly fantastic for us on Sunday. So just need to have a double check, yeah, double check the weather basically, and we__l have a look what we__l do. It__ very difficult to, within two weeks, suddenly say a lot of things need to change out of the blue. It__ about starting the relationship and just understanding how everyone is operating. And then at one point, you come to conclusions and maybe you want to change something, and this is something that will happen over the coming weeks, months. So, it__ really early days, but so far, he__ very keen and very motivated, and that__ exactly what you want also. I got on very well with him. So, yeah, it__ been a very good start. And also with Simon, he has a lot of racing experience already. He__ been part of the team for a very long time. The last few years, not anymore in a race engineer role, but he steps in and he__ immediately on it. So again, very enjoyable to work with Simon. Yeah. I think it__ been good. We just tried to optimize the car. We tried to put performance on it like everyone else, and I think we are doing that. So that__ for sure a positive. We just need to keep doing that. The team can always count on me. They will always get my very best, whoever is in charge. They know that. I__ never holding back or anything. I__ always trying to give them the best possible result, and that__ also what they pay me for. For sure, it__ positive. We need, of course, positive energy, and that__ a great start for us. From what I__e seen so far this weekend, I think that will be quite tough. But we__l try to improve the car a bit more. I think I got a bit more of an idea what I want with the car. Now is it always possible to do that with the car? I__ not sure. But we__l give it a go, and hopefully I can be close in qualifying. I think it__ always something that you decide together. Of course already before the race, but even during the race, they have to update you as quickly as possible with these things. I think everyone does that. But it was good. It was very nice today.",Belgium,post-sprint,Red Bull
Nico H_lkenberg,"Yeah. Surprisingly, they've been very good. Nice to have a bit of time after and to enjoy the moment properly and not dive straight into the next Grand Prix. So that was good timing from that point of view. Obviously, just an incredible race. Those conditions were very tricky, but we made all the right decisions and rewarded ourselves coming from last, which was pretty crazy and special. The aftermath was also overwhelming _ the feedback and responses we got, well over 700 messages. Took me a good week to work through it all, but obviously amazing and nice to feel and see all that. Also, a warm one. Obviously, a very happy one. I think it was important to go back and cherish the moment and share that with everyone in the factory, not just at the track. So it was good. Amazing memories, amazing emotions for us, and I hope that they can boost us for the rest of the season. I think we're definitely on a good run lately. Silverstone, set aside _ special race, special circumstances. I think you also have to remember on Saturday, both cars were out in Q1, and it didn't look that fantastic. Had it been a dry race, it would have been a totally different story and outcome. So, you always have to remember that too. But definitely from Barcelona, we gained some momentum. We made a big step forward with the car, especially in the long stints in the race on Sunday. We have a good race car now and we can do something even with not the best starting positions. I think that__ the best news of the season so far, but still a lot of work ahead and still a very competitive and tough fight in the midfield. The first part _ to be honest, it was not something actively on my mind. You go out there as a driver, you want to maximise and get the best possible result every time. Of course, you're still dreaming and want to achieve these things, but it's not always in your full control. So, it didn't really bother me. I'm confident and happy in my own skin and just enjoying the ride, enjoying the season, the challenge that's ahead, and the project I'm part of. That's the most important and main thing for me, to be honest. Jonathan _ I think he arrived, and it's still quite fresh. But coming from a team that has been so successful and dominant in Formula 1 and operationally very strong, I think he sees us with a fresh pair of eyes with his experience. Very quickly he saw possibilities to optimise here and there. It__ just shortcuts to performance and to a better and a more streamlined organisation and race operation. He applied some things in the structure of the team which are beneficial and helpful. Often, it's just little tweaks, but many little tweaks are a positive contribution. And back at the factory, there's a lot more work to do as we grow, to put the pieces into position and make sure they work productively in the future. Honestly, I think many teams can aim for that. Probably all the midfield teams have a crack at it and a realistic chance. It's always going to be a little bit track dependent _ maybe who's going to be better, more competitive that weekend _ but I feel that we are all in a very tight battle. We all have that possibility to fight for that position in the Constructors_ Championship. So, yeah, half a season to go and it's going to go down to the wire, I think. Yeah, I mean, you obviously have past references. We go out and feel the grip _ you start somewhere and build from there. You react to what you feel and to what the conditions are and just work your way in. Physio _ yeah. I mean, they__e one of the people you work with probably closest and spend most time with on a race weekend. Maybe also off-track preparing the season and in between races. So, it's usually someone important to you that supports you, keeps your body fresh, makes sure you__e in physical good shape, but also there for many other things mentally. They're not just support crew _ your personal one. They are very important. It__ not something I thought about further or spent time thinking about. It is what it is, and I__l happily take it. Yeah, some time at Renault. Obviously, [Alan] has been around so long, so much experience _ so, great opportunity for him to put that all to work. Happy for him and wish him best of luck. Nothing to add. What kind of a question is that? I think it's very personal. Everyone is different. Some like it and are on it, some less. I think you need to find these things out for yourself and then find the right balance, I guess. I__ not sure I understood the question properly. But I think there__ no correlation between the movie and between experienced drivers or older drivers and recent results. It just always happens circumstantial _ what your relative car performance is, how your weekend goes. We just came out on the right side of it two weeks ago. But it could be very different here this weekend. It__ different every time, and you just try to optimise and maximise what you have, like Fernando says. Well, I don__ expect Silverstone Sundays to repeat themselves so easily or so soon. I don__ think that__ going to happen again quickly. I think it__ more, like I said earlier _ the midfield battle is very alive and very real. Depending on the track, you__e in the points or you're not. Everyone is very close together. The gap between P10 and P last is very tight. Small differences make the difference. We__e had a strong race car recently _ strong race pace, good tire management, good tyre life. So, I hope we can put that to good use in the remainder of the season and score more points. 2026 _ well, for everyone, it__ ongoing in parallel to this season. Everyone is developing, pushing, exploiting the new regulations. Obviously, there__ no reality for us yet _ the car is only going to be available in January next year. Maybe some simulator stuff, but it__ only starting to drip in a little bit with us drivers, at least in our case. But I know back at base, all the teams are flat out working on the future.",Belgium,thursday,Sauber
Franco Colapinto,"Yeah. It's been good. I think to have a break to reset and go back to the factory, work a bit with the guys, and really focus on what we need to improve. Keep working with the engineers and everyone back at the factory was good. Little break to reset as well. So, yeah. Ready for Spa. I think there have been different tracks, we have some different weaknesses, but especially in long runs, they've been quite strong lately. We are still focusing quite a bit on performance in low fuel and still lacking in the new tyre runs most of the time. So working with the car to find that confidence that sometimes I lack in the very high-speed corners. But I think generally it's been improving. I started quite strong in Silverstone. Of course, it didn__ end as we wanted, but I think with some good progress. I think maximise the opportunities. It__ going to be a tricky weekend with the Sprint race, with the weather forecast as well. So I think try to maximise the car we have, the opportunities, and try to get on top of the weather. I think it's great to have MotoGP back in Buenos Aires. It's a country full of very passionate fans, and it's great to see a sport coming back. Of course, Formula 1 would be a bit more tricky to go there, especially with the track changes. I think they are more for a bike than for a Formula 1 car, but it would be great in the future. If they can do something about that, it would be amazing for the fans and for F1 to see what they can actually achieve there. I would love that. Of course, it's one of my dreams, but it still looks a little far away. A lot of work to be done for F1 to go there, but it would be great if in the future it can become a reality. I think nowadays they are getting more and more important. We spend a lot of time with them on-track and off-track. Sometimes the cars start to be a bit harsh on the body, especially when the porpoising started, and it__ good to have a good physio next to you to fix the body a little bit _ especially maybe for Fernando a bit more. We recover quick. I think, you know, Formula 2 is a great championship, but it still doesn't fully prepare you for F1. I learned a lot of things over these last few races. Since I started in Williams, to start working with so many engineers _ suddenly you__e got 30 engineers in a room compared to two or three in Formula 2 _ and that__ a pretty big shock. Being able to communicate, to learn and listen to what they have to say, work with so many people _ it's a massive team. You__e putting in a big effort trying to go quick to score points for 1,000-plus people that are in a factory building the quickest car for two guys, throwing it on track. So it's a big job, and it__ a lot of effort that everyone is putting in to make the car go quick, whereas other categories are quite a lot smaller. Over the races, you just learn a lot of things. Experience matters a lot. That__ why Nico and Fernando are here next to me, they have so much knowledge. And when those special moments and special opportunities come _ like last weekend in Silverstone _ they are always a step up there. So, yeah, it comes with time, but it's definitely quite different to F2 and F3. Yeah. I think Formula 1, we all know it__ a tough sport, and we all want to be here. There are only twenty places, and it__ always going to be very tricky how you get here. It__ a lot of effort, a lot of sacrifice in the past for all the drivers that go to Formula 1. And only 20 drivers get to be here, and there are thousands that want to be. So it__ the sport we all love, and we are very lucky to be able to do it.",Belgium,thursday,Alpine
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah. I think since Silverstone probably with the package that we introduced there. We are a little bit more competitive and on the edge of Q3 and the edge of points every weekend. So, hopefully, we can keep the momentum going. First, I think the priority is to understand if the new parts are bringing performance. Always on a Sprint weekend it__ difficult to achieve that with only one free practice. Maybe the weather is not helping on that side. So, that will be the first priority. Then, yeah, try to score points if we can again this weekend. But in terms of car performance, I think understanding the new part will be the main difficulty and the main priority as well. Actually, I think 80% of the focus is already on 2026, in a way. Not only on the engineers and the design team. It's also the drivers_ head, apart maybe from the two McLaren drivers. The rest of us, we are just thinking a little bit and dreaming about what could be a good season next year, because this year is going to change very little, I think, in the second part. So, it is fun to see all the midfield so close, and maybe there is some action between all the midfielders in the second part of the season, and it will be a fight for fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth in the Constructors_ Championship. But apart from that, I think there is not much more to do. Try to learn, keep improving, try to work with the team in the best way possible. And as I said, in terms of points every two or three weekends, try to see the Constructors_ Championship and have some fun there. You try not to go flat the first lap and then slowly you go a little bit faster and faster. But on a Sprint format, for sure, you have to go into Q1 quite soon and maybe with a circuit condition that you didn__ test in FP1. So, that's the nice thing of the Sprint. But I don't think that it's a huge challenge. And actually, here, maybe we did more laps in wet than dry, so we know the circuit quite well. Especially, Eau Rouge I think, is quite dry, it never gets too wet there, it's quite steep. But last year the circuit was resurfaced and I think it could be a little bit more standing water, and visibility will be a challenge as usual here. So, yeah, let's see. Yeah, they're important even though the cars are now very easy physically. So, it's good for the young guys that they didn't experience the full attack. We are, like, ten seconds slower in the race than in qualifying now, with fuel and degradation, so it__ quite easy! No. But I think the team is trying to bring the upgrades whenever they're ready. Probably this was forecasted for Budapest or later in the season and they managed to bring it a little bit earlier, and we have a chance to test it here. There's no guarantee that we will race with it if we have no time to test it. But at the same time, I think it was welcome _ that there is this push from everyone in the factory to bring the new parts as soon as possible. So, let__ see if we can test it properly. If we do and we opt to race with it, we will have a better feel after the weekend. If we cannot test it in FP1, maybe we opt not to fit it for qualifying. At the same time, I think we have the parc ferm_ open after the Sprint race, so we could use the first part of the weekend as a test and then race on Sunday with the best spec. So there are plenty of possibilities. I__ not concerned. Yeah. It's great to see. Obviously, I worked with the three of them. And with Alan, particularly _ I worked two times with him, also when I came back to Alpine. So, yeah, happy for them, happy for him. They have a lot of experience, but also, they have maybe the leadership capacity and qualities that you need these days. With Jonathan it__ well known, but I think with Steve and Alan it will be a good thing for them and a good thing for the team as well. You're the driver manager now? No. Little advice, I think. For sure, it__ an extremely competitive environment _ Formula 1 but also any elite sport. You have to be ready to deliver your best performance every day. And when you don__ deliver, you have to be ready to accept some criticism and try to get better. But in Formula 1, I think we have a lot of support from our teams, our engineers, the technology, the data. So, I don__ think that it__ a bad place to work and to try to get better every day. There__ not really any advice. We all have different ways of driving, different driving techniques, different ways of delivering the job. We are all enjoying our time here. It__ true that we all want to win. And if you get to Formula 1, it__ because in your past you had opportunities to win _ in karting, in the junior formulas _ and then you had the opportunity to get to F1. And when you get here, there__ only one guy winning, normally for five or six years in a row because they are dominating. So, this is the only thing you have to manage _ you have to control that frustration. You need to still deliver 100% knowing that you will not win. Long, long question. But I don't think there is a straightforward answer. Actually, I don__ think Nico_ or think we both don__ care too much about what the next-generation fans think. We only try to win races, try to work with our team the best we can, and deliver the performance. The fans and the people outside watching TV, they don__ have the full picture of what is going on and the difference in performance between the cars. So, if next year Nico and myself have a winning car and we win eight consecutive races and fight for the championship, then they will think that we ate something different in winter or had a different training programme and we learned how to drive in the winter. This is not really the reality. We train every day, eat every day, travel every day, go to the simulator every day. We try to be better and better every day with our teams. When we achieve the result, we just try to share it with them and our fans around the world _ but they are not in our priority. And it cannot sound rude to anyone _ we love the fans _ but we don__ think about of if they realise how good or bad we drive. That is more for the team and the technical aspect of the sport, I think.",Belgium,thursday,Aston Martin
Carlos Sainz,"I would say, oh, it's a difficult question to write in a report card, but I would say it's been with some highs and lows. Extremely frustrating because I feel like I've had a lot of pace in the car. I've adapted to the team quickly. Right from the beginning, I felt with good speed in the car, but it's been very difficult to put two results together through the whole first half of the season. When it was not a reliability issue, it was an incident with a rival. And when it's not an incident with another rival, you don't even get to start the race in Austria. Then it was traffic in Q1, or some strategic mistakes we've done through the year. So nothing really has come together for us in terms of results. But in the middle of those ups and downs, there's speed. There is proof that we are going in the right direction. It's just when you don't have a result to back it, that's when it gets frustrating. A mix of things. For sure, being back racing in the midfield has its challenges. I think I've been out of Q1 two or three times by ten milliseconds, and you know exactly where those ten milliseconds can be. And that changes your whole weekend because you don't have a car to actually make it back through the field, like when you have a very competitive or a top-three, top-four car. If you're out in Q1 or Q2, you can actually still make a difference on race day and make it back through the field. In the midfield, everyone has the same race pace as you, and it's extremely difficult to actually recover unless you do something crazy. And then, yeah, just the car obviously feels very different to a Ferrari__ery different limitations, very different driving style required, very different setup that I need to find to drive the car. But that side of things I've managed to adapt pretty quickly. And maybe putting a bit of emphasis on how much lap time and results come from actually understanding yourself with your engineers, with your team, with all the strategy calls__ow you communicate during the race, how do you come to the point of making the right call. That needs a bit of bedding time to actually execute a good race weekend, both in quali and the race. Yeah. He's, I think, an extremely good professional. My time in Ferrari when he was there, I found someone that was incredibly hardworking. He understood very well the driver. He had a special feeling and a special communication with drivers, which I think makes things for the driver very comfortable and very open. Since his time in the FIA, then Ferrari, now Visa [Cash App RB], and now coming in Red Bull__e has plenty of experience to lead one of the biggest teams in Formula 1. I think he's honestly the perfect fit for that team. So, congrats to him__robably he deserves that upgrade or that step up. I think he's going to enjoy it. No, I think there__ no secret in Formula 1. If you do such a big commitment from the team to realise that you__e not going to bring many upgrades to a Formula 1 season, you need to expect that sooner or later you will start falling back__ecause this is exactly how Formula 1 works. And even the midfield teams__hey never sleep. Everyone is bringing, every three or four races, a bit of a package, a bit of an upgrade. At Williams, yeah, we brought a couple of things at the beginning of the year with the updates of the front wing regulations. But realistically, we haven__ brought anything up until now. So no secrets__e expected that. We still believe it__ the right call, and we still trust the process. We still trust that will pay off next year. We are doing a massive push on next year__ car. I__e had already a few simulator sessions with it. In debriefs, we almost talk more about next year than we talk about this year__ven if we are racing this year. I guess the most frustrating part is that when we had a very competitive car in races like Miami and Imola__hat__ when we had the chance, maybe with both cars, to score top fives. I was in the top five all the way through those races until something out of my control happened. And that__ where we__e missing 20, 30 points that could give us that extra bit of space in the championship. But that__ how the year has decided to go. Now that we have maybe a less competitive car, we need to get those small points. Maybe we__e not going to fight for P5s, P4s like we did at the time, but we can still get top 10s, top 8s that will help in our championship. Very complicated. It occupies a lot of brain space while you're driving. But I think if you ask_ I think Lewis was in the big regulation change between 2013 and 2014__oing from a normal V8 to a complex V6 with battery management and all these things. For sure, at the time it was a shock__ow much the driver had to think about things that before, on the V8, we would never think about. But then we all got used to it, we all adapted, and now it feels normal. I think with next year it__ going to be something similar. At the beginning, we__e all like: what the hell is going on here? Why do we need to do so much of this? Why is the car feeling different every lap? But then, by the time we start racing with it and the races go by, everything will feel more natural__omething we__e more used to__nd it will become the new normal. The big question is whether that new normal is better than the old normal. That__ the million-dollar question that everyone wants to have a say on or have an opinion about. But I think as drivers, we__l just adapt to whatever they give us. We__l just go as fast as we can. If we have to do six or seven switch changes through a lap, we__l do them. And we__l just become good at it like we always do. Yeah, I'm not frustrated with Formula 1 at all. I love Formula 1. We just obviously get to do a lot of interviews during our year. Some interviews are longer formats where you get to open up a bit about things that maybe in a more closed environment, like this one, I wouldn__ give you here a speech of ten minutes on how everything works. That__ why I__ actually a big fan of how podcasts allow you to explain yourself and to expand into deeper thoughts, deeper conversations that old-school, one-to-one, quick, rapid questions don't allow. In a high-pressure environment like Formula 1, you don__ get the chance to feel comfortable enough to explain all that. And you don't have the time__ecause we are here to race, not to talk too much. We already talk too much during the week and the weekend. So yeah, I just enjoy those formats, especially when it comes down to mental psychology, training, personal life. I like sharing some of the things that might be useful for other athletes or younger generations coming through__o see that we're also going through a rollercoaster in Formula 1 of emotions and things. So yeah. But towards Formula 1? No hard feelings at all. I love the sport. I enjoy every single time I jump in an F1 car. I have great friends in every team that I__e been to. I__e met incredible people, and I cannot wait to be racing here in Spa.",Belgium,thursday,Williams
Kimi Antonelli,"It's been challenging. I've had some highs and quite a few lows. I think the European season hasn't gone very well_ I think it__ gone pretty badly. A few mistakes on my side and then we had a couple of issues as well. I'm still trying to learn a lot and gather all the information because sometimes, especially when you have back-to-back races, it's a bit difficult to put all the information that you get over a weekend together and try to put what you learn on track right after. So, it's been a bit challenging. Also, on my side, I think qualifying has been a bit weak, but it's more for me about trying to put it all together, especially when you get to the point where you have to find the last couple of tenths, I think I__e not been that good on trying to do the right step. Overall, it__ still been quite positive because I__e been learning a lot and we__e got some good results. But now the second half of the season is important to do the step and find more consistency myself. Yeah, for sure. I think the rhythm of this first part has been quite high. The intensity definitely has been quite high as well. So it also requires some adjustment, especially after the first triple-header. I had to adjust the way I was managing energy during those three weeks. So overall, there__ a lot to learn on that side as well__specially on how to manage energy the best way possible in order to have the most amount when I go back in the car. This means also taking time for myself to recharge and be focused, especially on the mental side. There__ a lot of learning to do on that side, but I have a much clearer vision and ideas going into the second half of the season. That__ the one million-dollar question. OK, ok. No, I think, you know, I've never been worried, to be honest. I know the situation. I know what the team wants, especially looking at the future. Also, Toto has been clear recently, so that__ obviously good to see. But the team is working well. The line-up is good. Me and George are working well together. We__e trying to help the team to find performance again. I think we're doing a good job, and there's a really good atmosphere in the team. It's always nice to go back to the factory and see how much the team is pushing__ot only for this year but also ahead of next year. This means there's a good dynamic in the team. I'm sure the team knows what's best, especially for next year, and I'm pretty confident that I'm in a good position.",Belgium,thursday,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"We didn__ test. It was a photo shoot day, basically. So did like 10 laps or whatever_14 laps of filming. It was not a test. The same as before. So the same as it did the weeks before. No. I think, well, firstly, we'll get to test the suspension tomorrow, and I__ sure there's going to be learnings from it. We'll figure out how to fine-tune it and try to extract performance from it. On the simulator, there's no difference. But I'm sure across different circuits, perhaps there'll be benefits. For me, the positive thing is arriving at the filming day where you see that new bits are coming. You see that we are getting development. Because in general, we had an upgraded floor in Bahrain. Then it was quite some time before we got another upgrade__ think it was Austria. And pace-wise it wasn__ necessarily what I thought we would have. If you look at some of the other teams, they bring small pieces every single weekend__ike Red Bull often do or Mercedes do, for example. Whereas these are more like big chunks along the way. So I was just really happy to see that there clearly is a big push back at the factory. There are a lot of changes, and then to see the results of those changes takes time. So I was just really grateful to see that we got new parts. We'll try and put them to use this weekend. I can help you with the contract. I know how to work Toto. I didn__ hear what the question was previously. But I don__ know. I wasn__ really__hen I__ away from the race weekends, I don__ really pay attention to anything that__ going on in Formula 1 other than what__ happening within our team. So, I was neither surprised or not surprised. I was just minding my own business. And of course, I think when you change CEO or someone that__ running an organisation, they come with their own formula and more often than not, make changes. So that__ inevitable__ut that takes time. Yeah, I was at the factory two weeks, a couple of days each week. We did preparation__oing over where we were at the previous race, things that we need to change. I hold a lot of meetings. So I__e called on lots of meetings with the heads of the team. I__e sat with John Benedetto and Fred in several meetings. I__e sat with the head of our car development, with Lo_c, also the heads of different departments__alking about engine for next year, front suspension, rear suspension, things that you want, issues that I have with this car. I__e sent documents. So through the year, after the first few races, I did a full document for the team. Then during this break, I had another two documents that I sent in, and then I come in and want to address those. Some of it__ structural adjustments that we need to make as a team in order to get better in all the areas we want to improve. And the other one was really about the car__he current issues that I have, some things that you do want to take on to next year__ car, and some that you need to work on changing.
We did development__ried the 2026 car for the first time and started work on that. Thirty engineers come into the room and you sit and debrief with every single one of them. So big, big push. Otherwise, just training__retty hard. Maybe a little bit too hard. A bit heavy this weekend. For me, the thing I love about Formula 1 is that there are these changes that come along the way. There__ so much innovation and development. And every time they make these changes, the learning curve is so steep for everyone within the team. So it really challenges us all to dig deep, to innovate. Even from a driver__ perspective, it__ got more and more intricate as the years have gone on. Like Carlos mentioned, this next step, I would say, probably the driver has even more input into the development__articularly of the power unit and how you use the power. I don__ really want to shut it down, because maybe things will be good. Let__ see when we get into the next season. It could go either way__t could be good, it could be not so good. But only time will tell. What I love is that while we__e fighting this season in this championship, we__e also having to develop the current car__nd then the next car. And that, for me, is fascinating. If we were just with the same car all the time, evolving on a very small gradient, it just would not be anywhere near as fun. Very, very difficult. We don__ have a lot of time, so you need to double up. You need to make sure you get as much information from both cars. You need to do the whole session. If it__ wet, then that really helps your learning. But in terms of fine-tuning the car, it__ highly unlikely we__e going to fully optimise it during this weekend. It'll probably be something we__e optimising over the next few weekends. That doesn__ change anything in my life. What to say? The team has been__t__ been incredible to see the progress. I remember sitting with Christian back in 2005? I remember sitting in his office in GP2. Well, I was in Formula 3, but looking to go into GP2 for his first year. I think he was at Arden or something. I wouldn__ say we hit it off from the get-go! But to see his progression and career__t__ been clearly remarkable what he did with the team. With a huge group of amazing people, to really run an organisation that big and that well takes talent and skill. And that__ what he brought to the team. So, I wish him all the best. The reason for it is that I see a huge amount of potential within this team. The passion__othing comes close to that. But it__ a huge organisation, and there are a lot of moving parts. And not all of them are firing on all the cylinders that they need to be. That__ ultimately why the team has not had the success that I think it deserves. So, I feel that it__ my job to challenge absolutely every area, to challenge everybody in the team__articularly the guys that are at the top who are making the decisions. If you look at the team over the last 20 years, they__e had amazing drivers: Kimi, Fernando, Sebastian__ll world champions. However, they didn__ win a world championship.",Belgium,thursday,Ferrari
Nico H_lkenberg,"Yeah, good! It's been a long time coming, hasn't it? But, yeah, I always knew we have it in us, I had it in me somewhere. So what a race, coming from virtually last, doing it all over again from last weekend. It's pretty surreal, to be honest. Not sure how it all happened, but obviously crazy conditions, mixed conditions. It was a survival fight for a lot of the race. I think we just were really on it. The right calls, the right tyres, at the right moment. Made no mistakes and, yeah, quite incredible. I mean, today, I think I was in denial until probably the last pit stop, you know, and then when I heard we gapped Lewis quite a bit with the one extra lap, I was like, __kay, this is good, this is some breathing space_, but then he was catching quite quickly. So yeah, the pressure was there. It was an intense race, but like I said, we didn't crack. No mistakes. And obviously really, really happy with that. Yeah, I was thinking that, you know, obviously he's going to give it all here in front of his home crowd. And I was like, sorry guys, but it's also my day, I__e got to stick my neck out and, yeah, super happy. Thank you very much for the great energy and support here every year. Thank you. Happy, but, you know, it's a lot to take in, to process. It's been a very intense race. I think Lando has put it pretty well. It's so intense for us in the car in these changeable conditions on a damp track. You always feel like with one foot you're in the wall when you're exploring and on the limit and then trying to push. So, yeah, very intense. Obviously, it was a kind of a distance battle with Lewis at the end who was making up some ground, but not enough, luckily for us at the end. So, yeah, everything coming together, big relief, very happy, very positive day. From a massive low yesterday being almost last, literally on the grid, to this result is kind of surreal. It's going to take a few days to process everything and take it all in. Good news is we have two weeks now to enjoy it and to celebrate it properly over the next week before we go again. Before we pitted back onto slicks. I passed Lance, then Lewis passed Lance pretty quickly, and then I was able to keep him at bay and even pull away when the Inters started to wear more and more. So I was like, that was looking pretty positive and encouraging. Then I think we made a really good call by stopping one lap later than he did for the slicks, and we gained I think around ten seconds. That gap was crucial. From there onwards, felt like a pretty long ten, 11, 12 laps, whatever it was. But from there onwards, I knew we have every chance to get this result. We just needed to keep it on the road while pushing. You want even more? Jesus! I think that's pretty good for starters today. If we had a dry race, it would have been a very different day and outcome for us. Whilst we've made some really good improvements since Barcelona, today is obviously circumstantial, and the conditions made this race and this result possible. But I feel in the midfield fight we've definitely gained some momentum, and we are a serious competitor there. That's where our fight is, but it's always about maximizing every race, every weekend, and just trying to do well. Felt good. I still remembered how to do it. Used to do it a lot in the junior stuff and then had to wait for it quite a bit. But it just happened so quick, the race, and you're still processing that. Then so many emotions, so many people coming at you, a lot of positivity, a lot of congratulations. At the moment just happy, relieved. But like I said, it's going to sink in more over the next few hours and the next few days, and I think I'll feel the enjoyment even more in the week to come. What? Sorry. Yeah. I love Lego! It's good. My daughter can play with it too. You__e always got to see the bright side. But, you know, a bit of silver or gold would have been nice too, but I won't complain. It's true. We pitted from inters to inters. Obviously, it was drying out. The inter was wearing down, the first set from the start, but the team said there__ some rain about. It actually changed within one or two laps from a pretty bright sky to dark clouds and I was just dropping back. I was really struggling with that first set. They said the rain is coming, so I just dived into the pits, to be honest, without thinking too much at the time and then went out and the rain started. It was really good timing. All the stops we made today, they could not have been better. We pitted at the perfect time every single time, which is very rare and difficult to do. But it's just how it happened today, and we really hit that one on the head. Behind Lance, he was quick. We had very similar pace, but then on that set of Intermediates, he eventually was just degging off a bit more than me when the track dried out. So, it just took a while to find a way through. But I wasn't even really thinking about the podium there. We were running P5, I think P4 at the time, so it was already pretty good. I was just about keeping it going and making no mistakes. Yeah. I mean, it's_ I thought about it. But today is better.",Great Britain,post-race,Sauber
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I'm not going say much. I'll get myself in trouble. So well done to Nico. I think that's the highlight of the day. So yeah, I'll leave it there. Yeah, I mean, apparently you can't brake behind the safety car anymore. I mean, I did it for five laps before that. Again, I'm not going say too much till I get myself in trouble. But thanks to the crowd for a great event. Thanks for sticking through the weather. I still like Silverstone even if I don't like it today. So, thanks for coming out, everyone. I hit the brakes. At the same time I did that, the lights on the Safety Car went out, which was also extremely late. And then obviously, I didn't accelerate because I can control the pace from there. And, yeah, you saw the result. I didn't do anything differently to my first restart. I didn't go any slower. I didn't do anything differently. So, a shame. I don't know. I don't think it's worth doing at the moment. I'm not sure it's going to be very constructive in all honesty. I don't know. But I don't really care at the moment. I don't know. It obviously hurts at the moment. It's a different hurt though because I know I deserved a lot more than what I got today. I felt like I drove a really strong race. Ultimately, when you don't get the result you think you deserve, it hurts, especially when it's not in your control. A lot. I think it was a really, really good day. A similar race to here 12 months ago and a very different outcome for the whole team. The whole team did a really good job. The car was obviously mega, and giving myself credit, I feel like I did a good job today. So, it just makes it more painful when you don't win. I don't know how different it was. I can only comment on what I felt I did, which I felt was well within the rules, and I did it once already in that race. So, yeah. I don't really get it. I'll go have a look back. I also have a question for Nico. How does it feel after fifteen years of F1 to get a podium [trophy] that's made out of Lego that you can just pull apart? It's just made out of Lego that you can pull apart and probably buy next week. Yeah. I thought I would ask the question. I knew what the answer was going to be before I asked. But I just wanted a small glimmer of hope that maybe I could get it back. But no, I knew it wasn't going to happen. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Lando didn't do anything wrong. I don't think it would have been particularly fair to have swapped, but I thought I'd at least ask. It doesn't change much for the championship. I feel like I did a good job today. I did what I needed to. That's all I need, and I will use the frustration to make sure I win some more races later. I don't think he had to evade me. I think he managed the first time. Going back to Canada, I think you had to evade more there than you did today. So, yeah, I'm a bit confused to say the least.",Great Britain,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Oh, wow. It's beautiful. Everything I dreamed of, I guess. Everything I've ever wanted to achieve. Apart from a championship, I think this is as good as it gets in terms of feelings, in terms of achievement, being proud _ all of it. You know, this is where it all started for me, was watching actually, was watching you on TV many years ago. And now, thankfully, I've been able to have my go. So yeah, incredible race. Stressful as always, but the support from the fans made the difference today. So I__e got to thank them for it all. Yeah, I mean, your mind just goes pretty blank. So everything you might think before the race, you forget. I mean, the main thing is always just don't ****** it up. That's rule number one. But the last few laps, I was just looking into the crowd. I was just trying to take it all in, enjoy the moment because it might never happen again. Hope it does, but these are memories that I'll bring with me forever. So incredible achievement. Thank you. Sorry. I'm also sorry. But yeah, amazing. Yeah, I think in terms of being a stressful race, this is as stressful as you can get. But I mean, it was a good race for Oscar as well. I__e got to give my credits to Oscar. He was fast the whole way. So yeah, a round of applause for Oscar because he put up a good fight, and I enjoy those moments together when we're on track. Not as much as when he's ahead of me as when he's behind, but that's life. And yeah, so credit to him and of course McLaren. To win at home in front of all the friends and family we have here is pretty amazing. So, a big thanks to them. Yeah, I mean, it's always hard, right? Because before the race, I'm like, I want to give them something to cheer about. But it's a long 52 laps and you never know what's going to happen, especially when it was raining earlier. So, it's always hard to imagine what it's going to be like. But now I'm feeling it, and it's unbelievable. So yeah, thanks to all the fans, all the British fans, all the McLaren fans. And shout out to my grandstand in the corner because I gave all my credits to them. They were amazing. They cheered me on every lap and it was really a beautiful thing. Where do I start? I mean, eventful race. Yeah. Eventful race. I mean, it means a huge amount. You know, at the end of the day, being on top in your home race is very, very special. And I said in some of the other interviews, you know, this is where it all started for me. I was watching on TV. I was watching, all those many years ago, Lewis, Jenson, Fernando. I think it was, you know, that extremely wet race here, in 2007 or 2008. That's when I really started watching Formula 1. And I think Lewis won, and I got that picture of him going around and seeing all the fans standing up, and that picture of what an atmosphere in Silverstone is like, and dreamed of that for many, many years. And today I got to live that feeling myself and see it through my own eyes. So pretty amazing, pretty special. A lot of people, from my friends and family, my brother, my sisters, my mom, my dad, my dad's parents. Every person that I could have here is here. So, yeah, more special than ever, 100%. And, yeah, tough race to do it in as well. I mean, it's tough to say it. Look, you can always class it as momentum or whatever, but I don't think that_ yeah. I don't know. It__ whatever you want to believe in the end of the day. I think it's still just one race at a time. Obviously, I had a good race last weekend and we had a good battle, and we got close, and I was looking forward to another good battle. So, you know, I give my credit to Oscar at the same time because he drove an extremely good race. But, you know, it__ two wins, but they've not come easy by any means. We've had good fights, but they're pretty strenuous, exhausting weekends because you're fighting for hundredths and thousandths, and you're fighting for perfection every session and I__ against some pretty good drivers. So, it takes a lot out of you, especially when you have a race like today. So, I've had two good weekends and, of course, I would love to continue that momentum, but it still requires more consistency. Two weekends doesn't mean anything otherwise. And I just need to keep it up and keep working hard. I think as a team, we did a very good job. I was pretty happy with everything. I think we made the right calls at the right time. Probably could have boxed for slicks a couple of laps before we did. But, you know, the first part of the race, Oscar and Max were fighting quite a lot, and I was pretty patient. I didn't push too much. I tried to look after my tyres a little bit more for some of the later stages when it started to rain again, but it was probably the wrong thing to do. I probably should've just pushed because we went onto another set of Inters. It's just tough to not crash in these conditions. It sounds so obvious and easy, but the amount of moments you have, at Turn 1, the aquaplaning in 2 , the aquaplaning into 9, where Hadjar crashed _ you don't realise how close sometimes we are to crashing and it all being in the bin in a matter of tenths. They are scary moments inside, but then they excite you in a way, and then you open your eyes, you concentrate again. It's scary and thrilling at the same time. But they're also fun races, but they take a lot out of you in one single race. So, a lot of decisions, but I think as a team, we talked through things perfectly well and we kept calm through the whole thing, and that paid dividends at the end. No. No tears. I tried, but no. I don't know. When I get emotional, I don't cry, I just smile. It's pure happiness. It's pure enjoyment of the moment that you're in. I wish I could cry because I think it looks better for pictures sometimes. But no, I just smile instead. Like I said before, this is where it all started for me, seeing this, having all my grandstands here, and even before the race just thinking like, someone's got to win today. I probably have a better chance than most. There's no reason why it can't be me. I always find it at times hard to picture and be too positive prior to races and never say today is going to be my day. But I was actually surprisingly hopeful this morning that today I could do well, and I had the pace when I needed it. I've joined a long list of pretty incredible winners who have won here in the past. Most of them are Lewis! But to join him and, from a British side, to continue the reign of the British here is pretty amazing. And just for the fans. The last two laps, looking up at the fans and seeing them on their feet and cheering _ these are moments that no one really gets, none of you guys get to witness. This is something that I and very few others, especially Brits, get to witness. It's a very selfish moment, but it's one of the most special, the most incredible, because it's such a rare thing that someone gets to feel and to see and to witness. For me, the best win. Maybe not the best way to win, I'm not going say it's my best win, that's not true. But in terms of what it means to win here at home, the want, the desire to do it in front of my own grandstand, my family, my friends, McLaren, His Royal Highness is here, to win in front of all of them and to make amends for last year makes it all even more special. So, yep, very memorable. You sound more positive than I still am. Yeah. It could be worse. It could have made it_ people talk about it probably too much. That's just my honest opinion. It could be that it's helping me, and when I say helping, it__ helping me by hundredths, thousandths, I don't know. It's impossible to numerically put a number on it. Like I said in previous interviews, it's something the team believed might give me more feeling, and I just roll with that. I believe. My faith in the team and my belief in them thinking this might help. Not a guarantee, but it might. And that's it. Yes, I won two races since. I was real quick in Canada. I'm not going to say it's down to that, obviously. I want to put more of it down to my hard work, my work I've been doing away from the track, with my team, with many people that I have around me. I put it way more down to that than some alterations on the suspension. At the same time, I could just say I think I could have achieved the same thing without it and just going back to our previous spec. So, I don't know. Hopefully, one day we get to back-to-back test it and I might get a feeling, I might not. My feelings have been good over the last few races, but I think more of that's come from just my working on trying to get better feelings and maximizing lack of feelings in certain areas more than it has been by so many improvements from a car point of view. But we've improved the car. We've had upgrades last weekend, things like that, and that helps. We won by what, 30 seconds here. We won by 20 seconds last weekend, so the car's pretty damn good. I want to put it more down to my hard work rather than that, but it's a combination of both.",Great Britain,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yes, good qualifying and you know I__ not going to be unhappy with third. Of course I__ love to be on top here in Silverstone, but Max did a good job, not quick enough for us today. But still, a fun qualifying. Qualifying here at Silverstone is pretty fast and it__ enjoytable and good fun. Yeah, not the top but still a good day. Little things today. Little things today, put you ahead of behind. Like, you saw how close Q1 was, which was pretty shocking, and I guess good at the same time. But yeah, little margins, little mistakes, little things. You__e talking a couple of hundredths here and there can win or lose you the game today. So tough, especially with the wind and the conditions. A little bit of rain every now and then. But still, all good fun and still happy with the third. I think it__ going to be fun tomorrow. I think it__ going to be a good battle between the three of us. Probably more, you know, with Lewis, with Charles behind, with George as well. It__ going to be an interesting Sunday, so I__ looking forward to it. Reasonably smooth. As smooth as I could probably ask for. Most of my laps were all pretty decent. Q1 was the only little nervous one just with how close it was from the front to last really. Otherwise, all good. Most laps always improved and found good lap time. Probably just my final one, would have hoped to find just that little bit more. Just didn't quite get the grip out of it in some corners, and the right balance, but I'm still happy with the third. Certainly it can be a factor. It was very warm yesterday comparing to today and then comparing to what it's going to be tomorrow. There's also some rain expected for tomorrow, so let's wait and see. I think it could still be a difference in strategies. Like Oscar said, every car gets lap time quite differently. We probably seem a little bit more in the middle of both a Red Bull and a Ferrari, but I think it can easily make a lot of opportunity come everyone's way tomorrow. So probably expecting a tough, but an exciting race. It's hard, honestly, to know until you get behind and you have the dirty air and DRS and things like that. To be honest, at the minute, our DRS speed probably just about matches Max's speed. So, I think it'll be tough because we__l probably catch him in the high speed, but we just won't really close much when we open the DRS. I think it can be tough, but there's also probably more opportunities than a normal race. Like they both said, between everyone, we're fast and slow in different places. You look at Red Bull Ring and you say Red Bull Ring is high-speed, but comparing to Silverstone, it's quite medium-speed. Here is definitely high-speed, and it's probably highlighted a few more of our weaknesses. We've performed very well in the slower and medium-speed tracks, some of the higher speed, we__e not bad, but we always seem to lose out to Max and the Red Bull, like Oscar said, in Japan, here, things like that. So, yeah, clearly things to work on. But I think we go into the race tomorrow, there's still plenty of opportunity for us. I expect everyone, probably more so the Ferraris because they're the highest downforce of the lot. Their high-speed performance is pretty impressive and a good step better than ours even. So, I would probably more likely say Ferrari, but I just wouldn't rule out the Mercedes as well. I think they're quick. George is always there in those kind of races where there are a lot of opportunities and unpredictable weather, things like that. So, opportunity for everyone, but I think the Ferraris are the ones who have been very quick since FP1. Very quick in high speed, and that normally always helps in the rain. I spoke to him once, I think. Once or twice. Twice including five years ago. But I remember that day, the day I launched my go-kart, and I literally remember the moment he said that to me. It makes me feel old, probably for one of the first times in my life, which is not a good thing. But yeah, cool to see. Always nice to see the new guys coming through and doing well. He has done well in the previous categories, and Formula 2 is always a tough one. So I'm sure he'll keep fighting and probably be in Formula 1 in a few years.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"I was happy with the first lap. The first time was mega, to be honest. I was trying to think of how I was going to go faster and I didn__. So yeah, the last lap was a little bit messy, but it__ been tight all weekend. I think the first time was very good. I don__ know how much the track would have improved, but a little bit on the table, whatever it was, it wasn__ enough. The team__ done a great job. We__e tried a lot of things this weekend, trying to get a bit more pace. The car__ felt mega all weekend, but there__ been a few points where we were scratching our heads as to why we__e not quicker. So yeah, the team doing a great job getting us back onto the form that we know. It__l be an exciting race tomorrow. Yeah, it__ tough. Especially when you think it__ a good lap, you don__ want to overdo it and try and go over the limit. I think it was a couple of corners where maybe I was a bit safe on the way in and tried to make up for it on the way out and it didn__ quite work. So yeah, always little bits, it__ fine margins as we know, but ultimately pretty happy with second on the grid. So, I__ looking forward to a fun race. Yeah, I think so. It__ going to be a fun race. You know, it__ been very evenly matched between Max, the Ferraris, I saw even George being up there at the end. So I think it__ going to be a pretty evenly paced race tomorrow, and all of have us got slightly different strengths. Red Bull is very quick in a straight line, we__e going to be quick in the high speed. So yeah, it__ going to be a fun one. That__ all. We__e going to enjoy it. It was a good lap. I was very happy with it, but I kind of felt like every run, the track was improving a bit. So, I felt like I probably needed a bit more, which was correct. The second lap was a bit scruffy, couple of moments that caught me a bit by surprise. I mean, I always hate blaming wind, but I need to see if it was the wind. But also, maybe trying a bit too hard in a couple of places as well to make up for it. Overall, pretty happy. It's been tight all weekend, especially through qualifying, so P2 is not a bad result. Not necessarily. For me, what's the biggest surprise is how each car is generating their lap time. You look at the speed traces and they all look completely different, but they end up basically at the same point at the end of the lap. So that's been quite interesting to get our heads around. I'm not that surprised that Max is quick here. It's quite similar to Suzuka, similar conditions to Suzuka. Clearly, they found some pace from yesterday. I think the big surprise was Ferrari yesterday, and even this morning. So not a huge surprise that it was so tight. Maybe how many teams were involved was a surprise, but it's been tight in nine out of ten qualifyings this year. I hope so, because there wasn't a whole lot in Japan. Let's see. I think the tyres will be a bit more interesting than they were in Japan potentially, and also with the different strengths of different cars that we'll see which seems to be the better compromise tomorrow. I hope so. If it's good for one overtake, then I'd be pretty happy. But let's wait and see. It's hard to know at the moment. I think, for us, what's been impressive is some of the high-speed performance that they can continue with, even with the light downforce. So, let's wait and see tomorrow. Of course, I hope that the higher downforce works a bit better in a few areas, but honestly, we really won't know until tomorrow. It's also been interesting with other teams, it's not always just been the higher the downforce you have the quicker you are in all the corners. Some of the corners we__e still slower than the Red Bull and Max. So, it's not that straightforward, but I think it's going to be an interesting thing to see tomorrow.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"It was tricky out there with the wind, through the whole qualifying Q1, Q2, Q3. It was all shifting around a bit. Yeah, a bit different. And around here with these cars, it__ extremely sensitive to it. So yeah, just trying to tidy it up throughout the whole qualifying and that final lap was good enough. But you know, I mean, this is a proper track, in qualifying when you have to go flat out in all these corners. It__ really, really committed and that__ really enjoyable. Yeah, exactly. We__e quite quick on the straight, which of course is not that easy in the high speed corners to manage. But we did today, luckily. Of course, we have to wait and see what tomorrow will do, if there__ a bit of rain around and all. But I__ happy, of course, with our qualifying. It__ a big boost for the team as well. Just excited to go racing now tomorrow. Difficult to say, but we__l try. Now we__e going to go racing, we__e going to have fun, and we__e going to try to do the best we can. Pretty good. I mean, it was not easy out there to produce a consistent lap time just because of the wind, the gusts as well that you got out there. The car was moving around a lot even just on straights, so sometimes a bit unpredictable in places because of it. But luckily, that last lap came together quite nicely. Just had to commit a lot in the high speed with this low downforce that we have on the car, which we just tried to build up on. Luckily in Q3, that worked out. Everywhere except the last sector. So, every single corner, a little bit. My first lap, I don't know, it just felt really different to Q2. Just more oversteer, more understeer in places, and that then made the lap not amazing. But I never thought that I could find whatever it was, almost four tenths, I think. So yeah, it worked, so I'm happy with that. In some places, quite different. Yesterday, I was just understeering a lot but at the same time also having oversteer in places. It was very difficult to balance. I think today, we definitely improved the understeer and that just allowed me to push a bit more because understeer is slow, especially in F1. So, we just needed to try and minimise that. Yeah. I mean, let's see. We__l just go in there and try to do the best we can. Normally in the race runs, we struggle a bit more on tyre life. I don't know how that will be tomorrow. We have to wait and see a little bit also how the weather will be in general, if there is some rain or not. The straight-line speed is nice to have but you still need to manage the tyres around here. It's very tough with all these high-speed corners. But I'm just looking forward to it. I'm not really in a battle, so I__l just try to have fun and try to get the best possible result. Sometimes more than other weekends. I think it just caught us out yesterday. We had that much understeer in the car, which we didn't expect to happen. So, then you need to work around with the tools that you have. Luckily, we went into the right direction with it. I'm not sure how much it did, but for sure it brought something. I'm happy with any kind of upgrade that we get on the car. We just keep learning, keep trying to be better, and take it race by race what we can do. We looked a bit slow yesterday on the other wing. Plus, I was just understeering to the moon. So, I had to try and reduce a bit that understeer, and it seemed to work. It is light on downforce for sure. You can see that, I guess. But it seemed to hold on and that's why we decided to stick with it. We'll see what we get from it tomorrow in the race. Well, I guess naturally, I have everyone behind so I have to look behind me and see what will happen. But for sure, I can see a proper battle. Even in the long runs, there were a lot of cars that were quick. Even in qualifying, it was all quite tight. Like Oscar said, quite different lap time gains _ some quick on the straight, some quick in the corners _ and I think it's just going to depend on who can keep their tyres alive in the stint. Well, I think it's natural. Tracks that I just enjoy more. I don't like street circuits in general. I just like the high speeds, where you have to be committed. It's more flowing. That's really where an F1 car comes alive. Naturally, of course, the car has to work with you, right? We know that on this kind of track the car just comes alive a bit more. But as you could see yesterday, we were also struggling a lot with our balance. So, we had to fix that as well to be able to do what we did today. Naturally, I think if you look at our season so far, we haven't performed the way we wanted to. But that's how it is. I cannot change that. We are pushing all flat out, myself, the whole team, to try and be more competitive. Some tracks naturally are a bit better for us, unfortunately. The calendar is not all like this, so we need to try and also improve in other areas. It's not that straightforward. Otherwise, of course, we would have done so already. But at least I'm happy with today. It's a good boost for everyone, also after last weekend, which I think we were lacking a bit of pace, but also we were a bit unlucky in general. From my side, he raced for my best friend's go-kart team, so I already had a bit of information on him, and he's great. He's very fast and he just needs to do it step by step. I think the way that Red Bull also is preparing him is good. He just needs to do his thing. Being labelled as the next Max, he should just be himself. That's what you need to focus on. I think that's also what he knows how to do. He has good people around him that are like a mentor to him. So, yep, step by step. I'm happy for him. He's doing well. Let's see what happens when he eventually can get into F1.",Great Britain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"I mean, I'm very excited for everything. Every day is one to look forward to. Of course, the driving on track is still the best bit, but I've already done some stuff this morning. We did Trafalgar Square yesterday, which was pretty special. I went over to the stands earlier this morning. So, plenty of things for me to look forward to. All good things, all exciting things, more like a positive distraction more than anything else. So, it's good. And, of course, coming off Austria is a nice feeling too. So, ready to get going. Yeah. I mean, I think it's tough to ever put something above Monaco, but I said it before Monaco that if I could win anything, if I could swap all race wins for one, it would be for a Silverstone win. So, it's a plan. Obviously, a lot of work, a lot of things to do before then, but Monaco is special. I think they'll be very different, for different reasons. Monaco is just the history, what it means to everyone and the people that have won there. Silverstone is because it's my home race, and the British fans and the Lando fans, all those guys. So, different reasons, but it'll be the one that probably puts the biggest smile on my face, bigger than Monaco, and it's the one that since I was a kid and since I first started watching Formula 1 that I've wanted to win the most. I mean, it's obviously not something you necessarily think of when you are a kid, when you're watching it on TV. But you see the grandstands full, and you see all the fans. And I think that definitely adds to it. If you watched the race and there were no people there and you just saw a podium, I'm sure it wouldn't look as exciting. So, I think it's always very difficult to know what it's going be like, the feelings, in the sense of coming here and seeing people with your shirts and your hats and shouting your name. You don't know what that's going to be like until you're here. So, it's hard to anticipate that feeling and have the knowledge of it. But it's also the reason why we love our home race. It's a great track, but it's more the fact that the fans are the best, and it just gives you an amazing feeling that, for us, you don't really get it in any other sense of life, that feeling of support and endearment. So, special. Even more from my side that this is my seventh Grand Prix here, I think, and every year it gets better and better, and my supporters have grown and grew, and now to finally have my own grandstand is also something that's pretty incredible, to think that I'll have that many supporters and that many fans cheering for me. So, special to all of us. At the same time, it's one of the most loved sports at the minute, and it's still growing. The amount of people that are going to be either here or back at home watching on TV and supporting people who are trying to do it for their country and do it for the Brits, it's the same as when we watch tennis or football or golf or whatever. So, it brings a lot of people together and I think it's always an incredible thing. But it's weird to think that that's us. That it's going to be us on the TV and people are going to be cheering for us. So, it's always hard to think of it from that perspective, but that is the perspective and that is the feeling that probably makes us more proud than anything else really is the fact you have those people supporting you. So definitely, for me, one of the most exciting, fun, enjoyable, and memorable weekends of the year, for sure. I definitely don't say yes to everything. But this is a weekend when you almost want to do more, not more stuff, but more of the things like the fan stage. I'll do it more than just one time, and I went to see the grandstand earlier and my merch store and things like that. There's always a balance, which is the biggest part of it. I'm here to drive, to race, and to do well, and you have to always remember that's the priority. But there's only one home race a year. For me, it's all about the enjoyment and memories and things like that. So, it doesn't just mean more interviews, but it might mean more time with the fans and doing events rather than sitting down and doing more interviews. If you ask me now, do you want to do an interview, I'll say no. But if I want to go and see the campsite and some of the fans, then I'm happier to do that because it's more about the fans than anything else. I mean, if there's any place you would hope I can __ind my garden_, it's here. I definitely felt a little bit more back on track in Austria, but it's not a guarantee that I'm going to have the same feelings here. Sometimes it can be very track specific, tarmac specific, tyre temperature, whatever. I certainly felt better, certainly felt more back in the rhythm. My quali lap in Q3 was one of the best I've ever done. I certainly got that feeling, a bit more of the old me back, but I'm also not one to ever just say I'm back. I think I__e got to prove that with consistency and prove it to myself as always. Austria just gives you more motivation coming here to try and achieve a similar thing to last weekend. You always want to feel like your home race gives you a bit more of an advantage. So, I hope that's the case this weekend. I would say Canada was a fairly red line. Yeah. That was the red line. So, the red line is just no contact. That__ it, I would say. It's simple. It's also not simple because when you're racing so much on the limits and you're trying to push the limits of everything, it's so easy to make mistakes. As much as you can say we're the best drivers in the world, doesn't mean people don't make mistakes. Even the very best who have won multiple World Championships still make mistakes. That's the line that we don't ever want to cross, and I think we both know that very much so as drivers. We want to race. There'll still be times when as a team we get told we'll have to hold position or do this or do that because we're still under the guidance of the team. But the whole race last weekend was ""let them race"", and that's what we did. It's clear to us. It's not always something that we have to voice and make clear to everyone else, but it's quite simple. You can do what you guys want to do. You can have fun. You can get close. I'm sure it'll make them nervous like it already did last weekend, but there's also a lot of people that work hard to build our cars and give us the possibility to win a race in the first place. If we lose those opportunities because of something silly, then that's where we easily cross the line. So, free to race most of the time for sure, and just don't do what I did in Canada. Yeah. Honestly, and it's even an answer I can't give to the team that clearly, if you ask me now, is it better or not? I can't give a definitive answer. It's something that we believe might shift things in the right direction. That's how small of a change it was. It wasn't like, we know this is going to help, it's going to do a better job. It's also not a performance item. It's not something that we've got and gone, now we're going to be quicker. It's something that might change how the feeling is to the steering and to the front suspension. But because you go track to track, it's not something you can necessarily just change between sessions. It's not where I can just go out and give a clean answer to the team. It's one where I__e just got to have the confidence and belief in the guys and girls who have put it together and thought of it believe it's in the right direction to give me maybe some more feelings or a better feeling, or more of a contrast in feeling. And I'm happy enough that that's a good enough answer, that they think it's better, and I'm confident that it's going to give me that feeling, but it's not something I can go, I'm feeling a lot more in the car. I certainly felt more in Austria. Canada is a very separate one and the car is always all over the place in Canada, so it's hard to judge things there. But certainly in Canada, I felt like we unlocked a little bit more, but I also don't feel like I'm still back to the level necessarily that I was at last year with feeling, understanding, and things like that. But it's a complicated one at the same time because a lot of other things have changed too. So, as a team, we're working hard. Obviously, I'm working very hard with my team to understand more things and tried more stuff in the simulator and expand my vocabulary of driving in a way. But it's, yeah, also one where I guess I have to use my experience of being a driver and saying last year I was very confident that I had more knowledge, more feeling through the car, because I'm the last guy that will ever say, guys, the car is just not good or isn't as good or whatever. I never want to blame it in that perspective, but I certainly wasn't happy. I made that clear to the team, and I think I was therefore in a position where the team got to work on their side and I got to work on my side. Together, we made some improvements, and I'm happy with that so far. I mean, it's definitely my goal to do something like that again. I think especially from a qualifying point of view, my lap in Q3 was probably one of the best laps I've ever done in quali. So, in some ways, I want to be confident that if I can replicate it, then no one can beat it. That's how good it felt. But I also know how hard it is to achieve that every single weekend in the first place. So, it's a tricky one. All I can do is focus on this weekend, focus on practice, then quali, then the race. I also don't have the expectation that I'm going to do it every weekend. I have the desire, but not the expectation to have a weekend like that every single weekend. Like I said, all I can do is work on my job one step at a time. The team do their stuff, and together we try to achieve it more than once. I'll clear up the first bit. I'll say I'm more comfortable. I wouldn't say I'm completely comfortable. The thing is, it's hard because I can't really compare to many other people. I don't know what other people think, feel, do inside the car, and I can only speak for myself and my experience of previous years, and only ever driving McLarens, because that's the only car I've ever driven. So, I have to use my experience and voice my opinion on what I think is different and all those things based upon my past experiences in different cars over the past few years. But I'm also very much a driver who feels most of my things, like most people, through their hands. There are obviously many other senses that when you're in the car, you try to use and utilise and put them all together, whether it's your vision and just feeling through your body and your legs, your feet, but always my understanding of where the grip lies comes through my hands and through the steering wheel. For me, that's my most sensitive area. Anything that's always been since I've started, I've always been very vocal, more vocal than my past team-mates, whether that was with Carlos or Daniel, on issues that I've had in terms of feeling through the steering and grip and understanding these different things. That can be positive and negative at the same time, but that's just something I've learned over the years. I think it's a strength of mine, my understanding of that. But therefore, when I don't have those feelings and I can't use those feelings to get the maximum out of the car to perform at my limit, then I'm not happy, I guess. And I'm not as comfortable as I want to be. So, it's trying to understand where I feel like we've lacked or we've lost some of those things this season and how to get them back. I mean, theoretically_ I'm not even going to say it. I have the best chance of winning the race, I would say, and of course the one who's most likely fighting for the Championship this season. Am I British number one? I don't know. I don't know how much you take history into account. I think if you still take history into account, then Lewis is quite convincingly at the top. A lot more race wins and poles and championships than anyone else really, put together. So, maybe I'm the favourite of the weekend from a British point of view, but I don't know. That's your job to put the numbers on people, not mine. It would be nice. That's my goal. It's the same as it is with any sportsman in whatever series they are, tennis, golf. You want to be number one, but I would say I've not proven myself to be that yet, but it's something I'm working on.",Great Britain,thursday,McLaren
Alex Albon,"Yeah. It was great. It was first time there. Have you been there before? No. Ollie was there as well. It was interesting. It's bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. Didn't expect that. That was about it. Firstly, we need to understand why we've had so many DNFs. It's a recurring issue. We have some tests to try to understand where it's coming from. We'll change our own plan and try to get to the bottom of it, but it's not totally solved yet. So, obviously, it would be nice to finish the race on Sunday, and we're working hard. We've done a lot of work back at the factory over the last two days to understand it more and more. I think we know what area we need to focus on, and then hopefully FP1 produces some results that we can move on from. Yeah. I would say very similar to Lando in many ways. The sport is so fast-paced, it's hard to self-reflect and look at where you've come from and where you are now. Silverstone for me, that's where my dad took me to my first race, and the noise of the engines was obviously captivating, but in many ways also intimidating. I was like, there's no way as a five, six-year-old that I would ever end up driving one of these things. Back then, they did sound louder, to be fair. But the impression it gave me at that time was partly complete awe, but also didn't really believe that I would be able to think about going into one of them. It was always a dream of mine. Then I got my racing license at Silverstone as well. There was a kart track, which I think was taken down before. So, it always comes back to Silverstone when I think about my career. It's what Lando says. It's weird to think about now that you're one of those drivers that you looked up to as a kid. Sometimes I don't even want to really think about it. Just get on with my racing. But it is very amazing. Yeah. I think it's inevitable. For most of the teams at a home race, with a lot of people around, sponsors, family and everything like that, the demands are up, but I think the demands have been up every race, every year so far. It just gets more and more. But for the most part, we learn to try to stabilise everything and rest as much as we can. I think there are a few races where we don't mind doing a little bit more, and Silverstone's one of them.",Great Britain,thursday,Williams
Oliver Bearman,"Yeah. I think excited is an understatement. It was 12 months ago I announced that I would race in F1 this year, and that was very special. So, returning as a full-time driver is an incredible feeling and really excited to race here for the first time as an F1 driver. Yeah. We have some upgrades this weekend. It looks like it's going to point us in the right
direction. Generally, our weak point has been qualifying, because actually in race pace, we've been pretty strong. We've been P10 and P11 for the last two races, with qualifying positions that tell us that we shouldn't be that good. So, this is going to hopefully bring a bit more quali performance, high-speed performance, and hopefully that can give us a few hundredths, because that's all it really takes. It's really tight. Yeah. I'm just starting, so I don't know how it feels to race at home yet, but my first time at Silverstone was in 2015 for the Grand Prix, so exactly ten years ago. I was one of the people in the crowd, cheering, and now to be one of the people on track and making people so happy and united is a really incredible feeling. I'm really proud to be racing in the UK, flying the flag, and hopefully we can all have a great weekend. I was cheering for [Sebastian] Vettel! Actually, if you hear the podium ceremony, you can hear a little kid shouting Ferrari, that was me. Lewis won but Vettel was third on the podium. Yeah. Definitely a bit busier than the standard weekend. Starting on Wednesday, we visited the Prime Minister yesterday. Can't say I've ever done that before on a race week, or ever, actually! But, yeah, it's the home race, and of course there's a lot more attention and stuff going on. But by the same token, I think we saw in Kimi's case in his home race, a lot of extra stuff, and I think it's important to still have the energy to race and remember that the focus of the weekend is qualifying and the race. So, I've personally been quite vocal with the guys about trying to keep things as efficient as possible, especially since it's my first time. I want to remember it for being a great weekend and such a fun weekend on track, and we're doing a great job of that. Yeah. It's been amazing to watch him grow up in motor sport. I remember some of our first times on the track together in karting, and those are always some really fun memories, ones that I'll cherish. I was so proud to watch him win his first race. That feeling of standing on the top step of the podium for the first time is incredible. He got to share that with his _ well, with my family actually. Except me. I wasn't there! With his family? I'm not adopted, I promise. And, yeah, it was really, really nice to see. Now he gets to race in the British GP, so I'm not the centre of attention. It's spread about. No, it's going to be really nice. The only thing I don't envy him for is the early starts, because I think he has to be at the track at like 6am on Saturday. Aside from that, he's going to have a great weekend, and I'm really looking forward to it for him. We were on the sim together a little bit. I was giving him a few tips. I think he has the highest chance out of us two of scoring a podium this weekend. So, I wish him the best of luck.",Great Britain,thursday,Haas
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah. I mean, first of all, I think we are quite satisfied with the latest tendency. We are improving step by step. We are not fully satisfied yet because obviously the end target is to try and win races. But going into this race, I think it's a race in the past where we were pretty competitive. Lewis has always been exceptional here as well, so I hope we can have a great weekend and hopefully have a shot for victory. I mean, it's been a long time since we last fought for victory, so I hope this weekend is the one. Much tougher first part of the season than what we expected. I think when you end up last year like we did fighting for victories, fighting for the World Constructors_ Championship, we started this year hoping that at least we__ start in the same position, which was not the case. We struggled a bit more. But now we are finding our way again with the development. It definitely helped us to do some steps forward. I know that there are more things coming, hopefully as soon as possible, which will help us to close the gap to McLaren, to Red Bull as well. Mercedes seems to be maybe a bit more up and down. But it__ up to us to do a better job than others and try and catch the guys in front. I don't know. I hope brighter than the first one. I__l be worried if I didn__ think that way because obviously we are doing everything in order to close that gap as much as possible. We are going to try and bring upgrades as soon as possible that will tackle some of the weaknesses we have. I__ sure it will close the gap. Whether it will close completely the gap, I don__ think so. It__ a significant advantage that they have at the moment, and it__ not down to only one upgrade or one part of the car. I think it__ a multitude of upgrades in order to get to the level. But little by little, at least if we are close enough to put them under pressure, I hope that we can force them into a bit more mistakes because at the moment, they__e got too much margin for us to be putting any kind of pressure. I can definitely say that the two reasons of why we did a step back are definitely not related at all. But again, I felt like we learned from our mistakes. I just hope that at one point, we manage to build a strong car from the start and have a very strong season from start to finish, which hasn__ really been the case so far. But yeah, we__e working in the right direction. I just hope that we don__ end up finding another issue in few months. But this you never know. Especially with those cars, I think it__ not only us in this situation, but many teams are in this situation where it__ very difficult to find your way because you always tend to find another barrier along the development line. So, yeah, we__e working well, and I just hope that we find our way now. I mean, I agree with everything that George said. I wish I knew what made McLaren so fast this year. For sure, they__e done a significant step forward, something that I don__ think many of us expected, exactly for the reasons you mentioned because when you get to the last year of those regulations, everything tends to converge a little bit. But this year they just did a big step forward. I doubt that it__ coming from one thing. It never comes from only one thing. I think it__ just many different things that they are doing better than others, which makes a big difference at the end. But it is true that one of the characteristics that significantly improved since last year is hot weather. I think I remember there was an FP3 in Bahrain this year where I__ still wondering how did Oscar do that lap time in that heat, which was very impressive. There are these kinds of laps that you look and you say, you__e just a bit lost for words and you don__ really understand where the performance comes from. So they found something, especially whenever it__ warm and on tyres, that we__e still trying to figure out. Oh, it__ so different that for sure I don__ confuse which car I__ driving. But to put back into context my comments that I did, it wasn__ really specific to our team, which I__e seen did headlines saying that we are struggling or whatsoever. I was just meaning that the new direction for us drivers is a little bit less attractive and a little bit less nice to drive overall. But it__ the way it is. I still find the motivation in the challenge of making these new regs as fast as possible. If we are competitive, I__ sure that I will start to like it a lot more. If not, then I__l probably hate it a lot. But I hope it won__ be the case. I mean, I kind of agree. It__ a big shame because we are very slow in qualifying. I wish it was the other way around, but I also think that it makes it look that way because McLaren is very often on pole position this year, and they are the fastest car by quite some margin in most of the tracks. So then they end up also winning on the Sunday, which makes sense. So, yeah. I don__ know. I mean, he has a point for sure. Numbers say so. I just hope looking at ourselves that we__e going to improve our qualifying in order to be a bit more in the mix for victories.",Great Britain,thursday,Ferrari
Yuki Tsunoda,"The issue in the race was me. The overtake_ tried to overtake in a way that probably I could just wait one more lap. It was a bit unnecessary to push flat out that much in that situation. So, the race craft wasn__ ideal for myself. The pace itself, yeah, to be honest, after that_ changed the front wing and everything and just, it__ not really probably the best reference I'll get. But, yeah, it__ still the mostly the session I__ working on really hard so far. Especially the long run is the stint or the session I__ normally struggling at. So we worked so hard last couple of days into here, what we can do better or not. And we're going to try another couple of stuff that I never thought about. So yeah, I'm looking forward to it, feeling strong. I think in the short run it will just come hopefully soon in terms of the confidence level I want. Definitely, yeah. I mean, I feel definitely the support, especially these days and more than ever, from Christian, Helmut. I went to the south of UK with a physio Red Bull Racing to kind of reset myself, and that was coming from them. They just wanted to have fresh air and everything. So that helps a lot to me to build up my rhythm. Also, we're going to try a couple of things that I never tried, and they allow me to do quite a lot of things that probably they wouldn__ do in a normal case. So, yeah, definitely. Yeah. I mean, I don__ know. It depends on the driver, but also at the same time, I didn__ see yet so far the driver who probably got used to it in that car straight away. So that__ probably the fact, but at the same time, I feel I__ in the right direction, at least on the short runs. Yeah, I missed out probably Q1 in Austria, but at the same time, gap was pretty small. Also in terms of the whole package, I know there__ something to come as well into this year compared to Max. So once I get full package, I still have good confidence that I can be in a level that they want. That__ what I__ working hard on. In terms of the long run is exactly the place that I__ still probably struggling at, but I__l find a way. I saw a couple of driving styles that I can try that I never tried in my career in Formula 1. It__ just the learning stuff. Is it true that in terms of confidence, when the condition changes every session, maybe I__ taking a little bit more time compared to where I used to have at VCARB where for example, I knew exactly how the car was going to drive in each set-up, I can go flat out from the first push. But maybe in the Red Bull, I had to build up, which for me is the right approach. I don__ think it__ a wrong approach, but just takes a bit of time. I don__ know if it__ going to take a whole season or not, but at least it__ positive that I__ going in the right direction. Yes, rather than him saying probably going switch in two races or whatever, for sure. But like I said, him and Christian are very supportive. He was not obviously happy with my race in Austria, but at the same time, he__ still willing to continuously help or support me. He still trusts my talent and the speed, so I just have to prove on track that I can do it. Helmut is just a direct guy. Some races if you do bad, he just tells me what was wrong and what was right. It__ a kind of pressure that he gives me. Sometimes brings me into the level that I never think about or extracts from me some performance. It__ just the way that he works since when I was a junior, and yeah, I appreciate the amount of support I__ getting so far. Well, it__ the truth that probably we__ be behind. But he was saying that probably that [unclear]. I don__ know. I mean, the performances at this point I__ getting, probably we__l be behind. But at the same time, I was not in the off-season tests there, so I don__ know. But VCARB so far, yeah, definitely performing well. I__e shown good performance first two races. Probably if everything goes well with Australia, China was a bit hectic, and if the strategy, everything goes well, I was probably scoring a lot of points. So it__ good that they__e performing. But at the same time now, I__ fully focused on Red Bull, and it__ a car that definitely you can make it work. I just need, I guess, my opinion, just need more time, build the understanding, work hard to understand, work hard with the engineer as well. I just have to get his point more. I didn__ drive last year in Red Bull, so yeah.",Great Britain,thursday,Red Bull
George Russell,"No messing around there. No updates since the last time we spoke. Honestly, as I__e said for the majority of this season, I__ just focused on the driving. Of course, this weekend__ a huge weekend for us. For me, my home race is my favourite race of the year, and that__ where I want to give all my focus and attention to try and win this Grand Prix. We were on pole here last year. We were leading the first third of the race. Temperatures look slightly more favourable for us this weekend. Not as favourable as they were 12 months ago, but much more compared to Austria last week. And we know clearly that__ where we struggled. So, yeah, just excited for that. I mean, there__ a lot of conversations behind the scenes that are not public. And I know where their loyalty lies. It doesn__ need to be public. It doesn__ need to be broadcast to everybody. We__e obviously spoken a little bit more over the last week because there__ numerous news articles and whatnot out there. But in all honesty, it doesn__ really change anything my side because, as I__e said before, I feel I__ performing better than ever. And it__ as simple as that really. Performance speaks for everything. No. I mean, that__ for you to judge. For me, I feel quite thick-skinned, and I don__ really read much news or listen to rumours. I just focus on the facts, and I focus on the driving. I said it at the beginning of this year, you can have a contract, but if you don__ perform, you__e out. And if you do perform, everything sorts itself out. So, yeah, from my side, not really much more to add really and just focus on the driving as I__e been for this whole year. I mean, every team has two seats available, and it__ normal that every team is considering what the future holds. And I don__ take that personally because I made it clear from the beginning. I__ happy to be team-mates with anybody. So of course there__ lots of conversations, lots of rumours, and all of these are being pointed towards me. But from my side, that isn__ really going to be the case. I want to continue with Mercedes into the future. The fact is, Toto has never let me down. He__ always given me his word, but he__ also got to do what__ right for his team, which includes me. But it also includes the thousands of people who work for Mercedes. For me, it__ nothing to worry about because I don__ think I__l be going anywhere. And whoever my teammate will be, it doesn__ concern me either. So, just focus on the driving. I think in life, competition is always good because it brings out the best in people. It__ something we__e been vocal about in the past. It__ probably got a little bit too much airtime in the past. Things have seemingly been moving in a better direction, which I think is just good news for everybody involved in the sport. But at the end of the day, if there are two people fighting for one position, you bring your A-game. It__ a bit like a driver__ contract, I guess! I think so. I think going into next year, there are so many unknowns. So many unknowns with the car, so many unknowns with the engine, with the fuel. And I think for us, from both sides, our best opportunity of winning is to continue as we are. We__e performing, I feel, at the racetrack at a very high level. I feel I__ performing at a high level. I__e been working with the team now. Will be going into my fifth year next year. And I think for all of us, you know, Lando, Charles, drivers who have been with their teams for so long, when you__e going into such a fresh start, I think consistency gives you your best shot. Yeah. My very first memory is a real clear one. It was the race start of the 2009 Grand Prix. I was sat on the outside of Copse, which was Turn 1 back then. I just remember the noise and the speed, just sort of giving me goosebumps. I was racing in cadets at the time, and I knew that one day that__ where I want to be. Then it__ where I did my first race, my first win, my first ever test in an F1 car was here as well, so a lot of memories. I mean, there__ not really any deadline in place, to be honest. Obviously, naturally, you try and have stuff done before the summer break. From my side, Mercedes manage me as well, so it__ not really a deadline in my hands as such. So, yeah, not really. And I__ not even thinking about it right now. Obviously, there__ a lot of questions about it. But the more we speak, the less we speak about it, nothing really changes. It__l happen when the time is right. I expect probably in the next couple of weeks, probably something to happen. But, yeah, we__l need to wait and see. If we knew, we wouldn__ have fallen back, to be honest. We don__ really know exactly why. They seem very good on the tyres. They seem very good in hot races. Clearly, their updates are working as they expect. And I think when you find yourself on the right tracks of this development slope, the rewards are endless, and they__e clearly found that perfect path. Like Charles was saying before, these cars, these regs are not easy. I think we__e all looking forward to a change of regs. It__ not going to be easy next year, but the cars do seem a little bit more conventional. But then obviously we__e going to have the challenges with the PU and the batteries, so that__ a secondary factor. Yeah. Pretty confident, to be honest. Because I think what I__e proven so far is plenty enough and not really much more to say. Any teams who did reach out in the past, I said, look, I am loyal to Mercedes. That__ where my future lies. Ultimately, Mercedes are my managers, so it has to be dealt through Mercedes in the first place. But there hasn__ been a lack of interest, let__ say. But I__e been focused on my side. I am loyal to Mercedes. At the end of the day, everything will work itself out. And the likelihood I__ not at Mercedes next year, I think is exceptionally low.",Great Britain,thursday,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Yeah, it was a tough race. You know, pushing the whole way through. Tricky, hot, tiring. But the perfect result for us as a team, a one-two is exactly what we want, and we did it again. So, I'm very happy. Probably the best comeback after Canada. We had a great battle, that's for sure. Yeah, it was a lot of fun for me. A lot of stress, but a lot of fun. Yes, a nice battle. So well done to Oscar. Hopefully, it was a nice one for everyone to watch. But inside the car it was tough, especially when he was in the DRS. The DRS is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap. But once I did, I could manage things pretty well. But yeah, he was still quick. So, it was good fun. Thank you. Crossing the line at the end! That was the best bit, but there was plenty of fun along the way, with Oscar, in the first stint especially. Some close moments, some good battles. Just a lot of laps of looking in my mirrors out of Turn 1 and all the way down to Turn 3. Stressful for sure, not the most comfortable position to be in, but it was a good battle between us. And then quite a long race from that point onwards because I never had a lovely gap, and Oscar kept coming at me the next two stints. So, yeah, good fun, but a tricky race, but well managed. No. I mean, we just had some good battles, and we've had a couple in the past. Granted, they probably didn't last as long as they did today, but no, I think we both knew what to expect from each other. We both want to race hard and race fair. It goes both ways, and of course, kind of have to put Montreal behind us and behind me for sure. It's something I wish never happened, but it was nice that we could go out and have a good battle and push things to the limits. There were still some close moments, but nothing that would make Andrea or the pit wall sweat too much. Yeah! Especially stint one. I think we got, like, ten laps here, and the gap was already, like, five seconds. And I knew what our pit stop window was going to be or was planning to be. And I was like, there's no chance we're going make it to the pit stop here. Oscar was pushing too, and I think we knew quite quickly that we weren't racing the Ferraris behind with a quick race car, and it was kind of eyes forward. But the first stint was difficult just because I couldn't get my battery up, and it was quite a strategic part of the race. And I was just always vulnerable for those reasons. But as soon as I did the pit stop, I could get the battery back up for the first time, and then I could be a little bit more comfortable. I mean, our strengths here were the high speed, so I want to hope it's a similar case next weekend, but it's still a very different track. It's a different layout. We're not going to take anything for granted. But the upgrades were working as they should have done today, and that's certainly a good sign. So I think we give a lot of credit to everyone back in MTC and to the whole team for giving us another very, very good car, upgrades that we just can put on _ they've been a little while and we've been pushing with things _ but we put them on the car, and they worked as they should. So we're satisfied. The team is satisfied and excited for next weekend. The best race weekend of the year, in my opinion. To have my own grandstand, to have the British fans for McLaren and for myself is something I'm looking forward to for sure. I mean, it's certainly, yeah, it's fulfilling for me. It gives me good confidence. I don't need to prove any points or prove anything to anyone, honestly. I like to prove things to myself, probably more than anything. So certainly, it's been a good clean weekend from FP2 onwards. Felt very comfortable and very on top of the car and performed exactly as I want to and as I need to. I just had a clean weekend. That's what I had. It's not that I've not been able to do it before and the pace has always been there at certain points. It's just there's been some different reasons for different things. But certainly, coming in today and yesterday to do the job that I did, I'm pretty happy with. But it doesn't come easily. It doesn't come just because I've turned up this weekend and things are better. I'm working a lot. I'm doing a lot more work than I used to away from the track with the team, on the simulator, with my own team, trying to improve everything that I can, both on and off the track. I think it's more a positive thing to see a lot of those things paying off immediately. Good step in the right direction. Still need more, so want more. So, we'll keep working. It's part of it. Probably not the precise stuff that I've been working on, but that's just part of the general improvements we've been trying to make. I think it was more normal improvements that I've been trying to make. Just things you need when you're trying to win a race. As much as I like to not have any radio and just do my own thing and concentrate, when you've got some quick guys behind you or ahead of you, there's nothing wrong with asking for a bit of guidance and a bit of help every now and then. I'm just trying to utilise the guys I've got around me. My engineers, my performance engineers, they're looking at a lot more data than I can see. Obviously, I'm the one in the car, but when you've got a guy catching you here and there and there are some corners where you can improve, then I want to know those things. I would say that's nothing more than just general improvements but also me trying to be a bit more accepting of some help sometimes. I mean, I certainly hope that part's not going to happen. The British fans are normally very accepting for all of us and especially for us as McLaren. So I think the first point should be for all the fans to embrace everyone and to support everyone. Certainly, for me, I don't think there's any more pressure. Of course, it's a place I want to win more than anywhere else, but it doesn't change anything. It just puts a bit more of a smile on my face every morning when I wake up. It probably distracts me in a good way more than anything. Now I've got my own grandstand, and I've got more reasoning for different things. More of a positive distraction, I would say, more than a pressure. There's pressure in every race. There's pressure to win today, to be on pole yesterday. I don't think I can put myself under any more pressure. That doesn't change anything. More just something to look forward to, to enjoy every day, enjoy every lap, enjoy the experience, because it's still for me an experience to have my own grandstand, to have so many of my fans there supporting me, cheering me on. Very excited for it. Kind of want to go there now, but I could do with a good sleep as well. I'm very surprised that there were track limits. Maybe Turn 3. Where? I think we just went off track. When we made a mistake, we locked up. The thing is we get a penalty for making a mistake. You get a warning for making a mistake. No. Yeah. I agree. They've got the gravel in the main corners where if you go off, you're going to gain time, and you can't gain time anymore. I went off, and I lost a lot of time. We just get the warnings now, but only when we lock up and go off. Same as me last year. I got a five-second penalty for trying to overtake, trying to race in a race. Makes sense. But those things, I think it's a bit stupid. But no, I think this track's a lot better than a couple years ago. It was like 200 off tracks. Now it's, I think, no penalties.",Austria,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Intense. I hope it was good watching because it was pretty hard work from the car. So yeah, I tried my absolute best and probably could have done a better job when I just got ahead momentarily, but yep, it was a good battle. A bit on the edge at times and probably pushed the limits a bit far. But yeah, it was a good race. You know, that's what we're here to do, try and race each other and then try and fight for wins, and that's what we did today. It was close for me but not quite enough. So, thanks to the team. To have the kind of pace we did whilst battling each other was very impressive. So, I can't thank the team enough for the car we've got. Yeah, I mean, I thought it was possible. I think qualifying yesterday was unfortunate with the yellow flag, and then I felt like the pace this weekend has been good. So, I think once I could stay in the DRS, I felt pretty good. Afterwards, once I dropped out after the first stop, it was tough to make the progress to get back. But yeah, some things to go over, see if we could have done anything better. Thank you. I mean, again, there have been a few battles in the past, not just last week, but last year and the year before. So, I think we both knew what to expect. It was a tough battle. It was close at some points, probably pushing the limits a bit much from my side once or twice. But we're fighting for race wins in Formula 1. It's going to be pretty tough work and pretty hard. I thought it was an entertaining race. After the first stop, maybe we didn't do the right thing giving Lando some breathing room, but the first 20 laps were pretty intense. So, it was a good battle. I knew that I was always going to be pitting second in that scenario. For me, it felt like if I couldn't stay within DRS, then getting back inside one second was going to be very, very tough. So, I kind of wanted to go a bit different and give myself some fresher tyres and hopefully be able to use them at the end of the stint. It didn't really pan out that way, unfortunately, but that was the thinking at least. We'll go back and look and see whether that was the right thing to do. In the moment, I was always going to lose some amount of time by pitting a lap later, so I kind of went, why not try something a bit different? Yeah. It made a big difference. It meant I could stay in DRS from the start, and DRS is very powerful here. So that certainly helped in the battle at the start. That was an important moment of the race, and then it pretty quickly became clear that it was just going to be a fight between us two. That was a key moment. I hope so, but you never know. Canada, we kind of thought we'd be good there, and we weren't. Here, we expected to be good, but probably not as good as we have been. I think we should be confident that we'll be decent, I think that's fair to say. But how quick we are, we'll find out next week. I don't know yet. We'll go back and look through it. Like I said before, I think I was always going to lose time by pitting second. I had past experience of being just stuck outside DRS, and that was a pretty painful place to be in the past. So, I didn't really want to be there again. In the moment, I thought that giving myself a bit more work to do but with better tyres was going to be an interesting option. With hindsight, yeah, maybe you can say it wasn't the right call, but there's a lot of things you can say in hindsight. Yeah. I mean, I thought it was a fair comment. Locking up and missing the back of your team-mate by not a lot is certainly pushing the boundaries. Even if I hadn't been told anything, I didn't think it was a wise decision to try that one again. So, yeah, a fair comment and nothing more than that. I don't think so. A couple of years ago they were chanting my name in the crowd, so that was unexpected. I'm not sure I'll quite get that again, which is fair enough. I feel like the fans in general this year have been a bit nicer to us. We didn't even have Max Verstappen fans booing us today, so that was a nice change. They've always been very accepting of me. Obviously, I race for a British team, and I think they're big fans of everything papaya and that includes both of us. I'm expecting there to be a lot more Lando fans than me fans, but that's fair. It's his home race as well, so I think it'll be fine.",Austria,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"I rate our weekend as a team really well. But unfortunately, the pace today was just not enough. In the first corner I was thinking about going, but Lando closed the door, and then that left the door open to Oscar. I lost second place there. But anyway, I think they were too fast for us to stay in second, so third was the best we could do. I don't regret much of what we've done today. I think we've done our maximum, just not enough pace. Yeah, in the first stint I think I over pushed a little bit at the beginning trying to follow them, then I degraded a little bit more. But it's part of the game. I__e tried, at the end, and it didn't make it today. I think eventually we need more pace. We've brought some upgrades this weekend and they definitely helped us to do a step forward, but we need to keep pushing in that direction in order to close the gap to the McLaren that for now are too quick. I'm missing it too. So, I'll give it all to try and be back on the top step of the podium. Obviously, this is our main priority. The whole team deserves it, and hopefully it will be at the next race in Silverstone. We__l give it all. Oh, I did not expect that question. There weren't very many key moments on my side. Obviously, the start, I wish I had done a bit of a better job to be completely alongside Lando. Maybe that would have changed a little bit for three or four laps. I don't think we had the pace to stay there in front. Basically, from Turn 1 one to the end, it was a very boring race. I was on my own, just trying to manage quite a few issues that we had on our side. Let's not call them issues, but we've got to do some management in the situation we're in at the moment. I won't go into the detail, but the lift and coast was a little bit frustrating. We paid a bit of the price for it on the first stint, but then the second and last stint were a bit more positive, which was good. But there weren't many key moments apart from the start. They are definitely a step forward. Yes. And I think it helped us to be on the podium today. The team has done an incredible job at pushing to try and get them as early as possible. I know that they are still pushing extremely hard to have other upgrades as soon as possible, which I hope will make another difference and will help us to be a bit closer to McLaren, to Red Bull in their good days, or to Mercedes even in their good days. So, yeah, we are pushing hard, and I hope that we see the result as soon as possible. Surprise is probably not the right word. The first stint was poor on our side, but the second and last stint I thought were reasonable, but I've got to look. I mean, I was obviously focused on my race, and I didn't see all the lap times. I saw the gap at the end of the race, and it's not the gap that you would want to see, but that's unfortunately the gap that we've had, if not more, since the beginning of the season. For us, we are working a little bit in relative to the others. And for now, this weekend, it's a step forward, and I hope that we can do another one as soon as possible. Yeah. We changed quite a lot of things on the car. Obviously, I missed FP1, so FP2 was all about trying to understand where we were. Then for FP3, we did a big change in order to re-centre ourselves. I think we did a really good job from Friday to Saturday, only with one session to be able to re-centre ourselves. As soon as I got into the car in FP3, the car was feeling a lot better. I didn't do the long runs with the setup of today, but there weren't any bad surprises as well. I think we did a good job by maximising the car potential this weekend. I don't think it's a problem anymore. I think the changes that have been made to the track are actually pretty good to stop the problem that there was before. So, yeah, it's not a problem. Actually, I think it shouldn__ anyway be a discussion. I don't know if anybody took a penalty today, but I feel like it's already a big penalty enough, as Lando was saying. It's enough of a penalty to go off now on a track like this. I don't think it's a problem.",Austria,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Oh, it was a good lap, that__ for sure. I guess just little bit by little bit. I feel even like my Q3 run one was good, but I knew there__ a few places where if I just got it right, I could get still quite a bit more time. And I did exactly that. So, I did what I planned to do. And when I plan to do something and it goes right, it normally goes very, very well. So yeah, very happy. A good day. It__ been a good weekend for me so far, so hopefully we can keep it up. I don__ know. I mean, I__ still very happy. It__ just a long season. I still savour with this moment, especially because this has been some of my tougher moments in qualifying. So, to put in a lap like today, to have the performance throughout this weekend like I had, was pleasing for myself. But I__ excited. It__ a long race tomorrow. I__ very happy with today, but I want to prove it to myself over and over again, and hopefully this is just the beginning of it. Thank you so much. Cheers, everyone. Thank you. Always impossible to say, but as close as I would probably ask for. You know, in all the places I could be close to being in the gravel or over the limit, I feel like I was. So, it was a very good lap. I think I improved in every corner and, especially around here, with the high speed in Turn 6, Turn 7, 9, and 10, especially in quali, you__e got to commit, and it's exciting and nerve-racking at the same time. So, yeah, again, rewarding when things go right like they did today. And to put the laps in that I did today, I was very happy with. So, yeah, it was a fun qualifying. Not really. No. I mean, the others were not far behind. Even the Ferraris and Charles was a bit closer. I think all the way through quali, actually, the gap to some of the others was bigger than I was expecting. They were not miles away in FP3. But then as soon as we went out for quali, we seemed like a good step ahead. So, I wasn't too worried, but there's this guy here on the left, he's also pretty quick, and the expectation is for him to go out and put some good laps in too, especially in Q3s normally. So, yeah, I think the pressure was still there, and I still knew there were places to improve. So, again, just try to do Turn 1, 3, 4 correctly and then push it a little bit more in the high speed, and that's what I did. I mean, it's very satisfying, but, again, it's about consistency. Everyone can be a hero in one weekend. It's progress. It's steps forward. I'm very happy with today, but it's still a long journey. It's a long season. The job I needed to do today, I did. And it doesn't make up for the last few weekends or anything, but I did it today, and that's what mattered. So, yeah, very satisfied and happy for putting it together when I needed to. I think a good amount. I'm starting in the best position. But we've been good since the first laps I did in FP2. We've been competitive, and I've been feeling confident and comfortable in the car. We've had some upgrades on the car this weekend, which is our first proper set of upgrades for the whole season. So, we've waited a good amount of time to apply them, and from what I see today, it looks like it's definitely moved us in the right direction _ especially on a circuit where there's only eight corners really. So, yeah, I'm confident we can still have a good race tomorrow, but it's a long one and plenty of things can happen. I think it's been clear-ish from the outside, and I think the feelings have correlated to inside, in terms of the car has just felt very strong. It clearly is very strong here, and very quick. I think where we expect it to be a little bit weak, or not as strong as some of the others in the high speed, seems to have been our strength all weekend so far. It's still trickier in some places, but on the whole, it was easily my best qualifying of the year from a delivery point of view from every single lap I did. I still made a couple of mistakes here and there, but none that cost me a lap or anything, just maybe a tenth here or half a tenth there. So, I think on deliveries, consistency and of course putting it in when it counts in Q3 was easily the best lap I've done for this whole season, probably even better than Monaco, honestly. Maybe not as exciting a lap as Monaco, but definitely a better put together lap than I did there. Some of that is small things that have allowed me to get that out of the car from the changes within the car. Whether that's the upgrades or not, it's always very difficult to tell still, but it was definitely, like you said, the most confident and comfortable I've been in terms of getting lap time out of the car and understanding that. I think it showed today that when I have those feelings, well, it's still not all there, but more there than before, I can have a day like today. So it shows that the feelings I've been requiring, the feelings that I've not been getting as easily, when they are more my way and more where I want them to be, I can put in better performances and have days like today. So, I think that's reassuring for myself, which is a very nice feeling. But it's still about consistency. This is one weekend, I__e got to do it for another, what, 12 or 13 or something. I mean, it's a bit of both. Hard to put a percentage on it. But I said at the beginning of the weekend when we all sat down, like, I still expect more from myself at times. No matter what car I get given, I still expect to do a good job in whatever car that is, whether I struggle with some of the feelings or not. But, you know, when you're fighting against the best, you want everything to feel the best possible. This weekend, I feel like I've had a little bit more of that. It could also be a bit track-specific rather than just car-specific, because there have been some tracks this season I felt more comfortable than others. But it is a small element from the team, and it's also down to myself quite often. I was quick in Canada for the most part and made mistakes there and misjudged many things there, and didn't put the laps together when I needed to. But the pace was there, and that wasn't through a lack of feeling. That was through not doing a good enough job for myself. So, I'm never going to just blame the car, and I'm never going to say I blame anything, but there are reasons for different things. What's most reassuring for me is when I've got some other feelings that I need, I do do a better job. That's the best news that comes out of some of these things. I mean, Max has been our main contender for every race this season. I think just because he's had a slightly worse qualifying today, definitely not going to count him out of the race tomorrow and definitely not going to count him out for the rest of the season. They brought upgrades. Maybe they've not worked as well as they wanted or maybe they have. I don't know. But I think we expected them to be quicker here this weekend. They've still looked pretty good for the most part this weekend, but I don't know what happened to Max in Q3. So, no. I think, of course, we as team-mates are probably the main rivals of each other at the minute. But at the same time, I don't think we're ever _ until he's out of the race _ I don't think we're ever going to take Max out of the equation. It's still a very long season. So, I think people just need to chill out a little bit. And we'll see tomorrow.",Austria,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, I__ very pleased. I mean, it__ been a long time since_ I think it was Monaco the last time we started on the front row, and it__ been a difficult season overall, but the team have kept pushing. We brought some new parts this weekend, which for sure made a difference because if you look at the gaps, everybody__ super close. So, it__ also thanks to the team, but I__ very happy with the lap. Overall, yeah, it__ a good start to the weekend. We know that we have a better car normally in the race than we do in qualifying, so I hope that we can put a bit more pressure on McLaren tomorrow. I mean, not with our car yet, but we are going to work towards that. But it__ not to minimise Lando__ job, obviously. I mean, he must have done an incredible lap. I haven__ seen it because I just got out the car, but I__l definitely look at it. Congrats to him. He deserves it. And tomorrow we__l try and bring him a tough time. Thank you. It's nice. It's been a long time. I think this year overall, we've been quite weak in qualifying and then pretty strong in the race, but it's good to be at least this time starting from the front row. At least we have a little bit less road to make before fighting with the guys in front. We're there. However, obviously, the gap is pretty big to Lando's lap, which must have been very special for sure. But I don't know if we've got the tools to fight for a victory tomorrow. However, as I said, we are normally very strong on Sunday compared to the qualifying pace, and this gives me hope. Well, enough to be P2 because the gaps are very tight around here if you take off Lando. So it definitely helped us. I felt like there were some steps forward. How much, we need to see it in different characteristics of tracks. It's not only on this track that we've got to judge that, but over multiple tracks. However, the numbers that we expected, we had them, which is a good start. That means that we are working in the right direction. I'll do everything to put more pressure than usual on those two guys. We have Oscar behind with a little bit of luck today, but tomorrow, try and look forward and see what's possible. There's nothing been confirmed yet for Silverstone, so I won't comment on that. Of course, there are upgrades in the waiting, but I don't exactly know when they will be ready. However, I think we are losing mostly on the high speed this weekend, which was expected. We expected to lose a little bit compared to McLaren in the high speed, but probably we expected to lose even more in the low speed, which was a little bit less the case. So, we'll analyse that. Obviously, we've brought an upgrade as well, and we are still in the learning process of understanding exactly what it does to the car. However, it seems to be working as expected. To reply to your question, very happy to be second. It's been a very difficult season for us qualifying-wise. We've always been fighting for P5, P6 in best cases apart from Monaco. That was a one-off. So, it's good to be starting a little bit further up, and to be straight away with the fast guys, straight from the start.",Austria,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"It was the fact I didn__ get to start it. That was the problem. I had Gasly spin at the last corner, so I didn__ even open my second lap. And Lando__ been very quick all weekend, so it would have been a tough challenge, but I think we easily had enough pace in the car this weekend to be on the front row. So always a shame when you don__ even get the chance, but we can still have a good race from there. Sometimes it__ just not your day. Yeah, definitely. I think our pace this weekend has looked very strong. I think the Ferrari pace looked good as well, which was a bit of a surprise, but I think we still got some opportunities tomorrow. So, I__ not planning on finishing third, that__ for sure. Yeah, to an extent. I think through all of qualifying, I was missing that last tenth, but not getting the chance to do my final Q3 run was quite frustrating. Sometimes those things are going to happen. I was quite happy that I didn't lose more spots by not doing that. So, third's still an okay place to start around here. You can race around this track, so try and make some progress. Pretty comfortable. FP1 was a little bit of a messy start, but then I felt pretty good through the rest of practice. And qualifying again felt quite good. It's very difficult around here to get that perfect lap because there's a lot of corners that have gravel on the exit, and you__e got to be pretty careful there. But there's also a lot of corners that you miss an apex by five centimetres one way or the other, and you've lost a couple of tenths easily. So it's not the easiest track to hook up even though it's short, and I just kind of felt like I didn't quite do that today. So, a bit of a shame. It doesn't feel that different in the car, but on the timing sheets, it looks good. So that's all we ask for. I think the pace this weekend has looked very strong. So, hopefully, that translates to tomorrow as well. I mean, it was changing a little bit throughout practice and qualifying, to be honest. I think some of my weaker corners at the start of the weekend became a bit stronger, some of the better ones became a bit weaker, so it wasn't a clear thing that was different every single time. I think it's been, like I said before, it's a difficult track to get everything together every lap, and maybe that was slightly the difference today. I felt like I was in the game and there. Just first lap of Q3 was a little bit messy, and then, of course, I didn't get to do the second one. So, yeah, I think there was a lot more potential out there today, just it didn't show. I don't have that much to add, but I think at this point of the year, it's still too early to rule out Max. I agree. I think we expected more from him this weekend, or in qualifying, because he looked very close in a lot of the practice sessions. So, I don't know if he also got caught out by the yellow flag. It's too early at the moment.",Austria,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Is it four? Five. It__ five. Well, I mean, there are no guarantees. So, yeah, we__l always, of course, try to do our best. In the past, yes, we__e had a lot of great races here. I mean, some, I think, back then were also unexpected wins. So, in a way, maybe we come into this weekend again, not as favourites, for sure. But I know that myself and the team will always try to optimise everything that we can. It looks like quite a warm weekend as well, so it__ going to be tough to make the tyres last anyway. But I__ excited. I__ here to do the best I can, and of course I hope to be on the podium. Yeah, I mean, hopefully it gives us a bit more performance. The team has been working hard to get these parts. So, of course, I__ very happy that we have an upgrade here. And yeah, every little bit forward will help us be more competitive and hopefully close the gap a little bit. But at the same time, we also know that others are also bringing bits throughout the year. So, we just need to keep working hard, keep trying to close that gap down. Brake late or go early on throttle, smooth driving. I__e always felt good here for whatever reason. I think there are always tracks that are naturally probably suiting you a bit better than others. And this one probably suits me a bit better than some others, naturally. I know, of course, it__ our home Grand Prix, but I don__ know. It__ just a flow of the track, maybe in Sector 2, Sector 3, faster corners. You need a car that performs around here. And I think for most years, our car has been pretty decent. Last year was a bit of a surprise, the gap in qualifying, but I think we really executed the performance well in qualifying with our tyre prep and everything, which on a short lap is not always the easiest. Because I think in the race, it was a proper battle. I mean, it__ more than normal that someone that has achieved so much with Red Bull, has been brought up by Red Bull, that, in a sense, there__ always a spot available, right? I think also, Seb always kept a really good relationship with Helmut anyway, even when he left. So, I didn__ know that they were talking, but I__ sure that there__ always a space for Seb in any kind of form. I think everything has been said about Montreal. At least,  I have nothing to add from that race. I have nothing to add. It doesn__ help anything to keep talking about it. Has it changed? I__e not seen anything. I__e been busy. OK. Well then, it__ the same. We know that already. Well, I think first of all, every driver is different. Every driver needs a different thing from the car. So what I need from the car might not work for someone else. That is quite normal. So, from my side, I just focus on what I need from the car, and just go off what I learned from a very young age _ how I drive, how I adapt to car situations. For me, it__ a very natural process. It__ nothing really special from my side _ how I do things. It__ just how I know how to operate, how to work. We just focus on if I have understeer, oversteer, how can I balance it out, how can I adapt my driving, and how do we move forward with the progress of the car? There__ no rocket science behind it. It__ just what I feel, what the team sees, and you communicate what you want to improve on. Every year you build a new car, and there are always things that can be done better. Then if things cannot be modified very quickly, how can I adapt as a driver? It is a constant process that you go through in Formula 1. You__e joking? Is this like a trap? I'm getting this question every single time, every weekend. I have nothing to add. No. But I think also how you now worded it is not how he meant it. I have a great relationship with Checo. We__e always been great team-mates. I have a lot of respect for him, he has a lot of respect for me. That__ it from my side. I__ looking forward to hopefully seeing him again soon in the paddock. I still need to give him a helmet of mine _ I promised him that, because he gave me one of his with a very nice message on it. I promised him, yeah, hopefully around Mexico that I can give him mine. So, for me, whatever is written in the media, I know how Checo is and we have a great relationship. Well, it was also more for myself. I had not really driven the Aston that much up until that point. It was very early in the season, so I just wanted to get a bit more experience for myself. The guys, of course, are racing it, preparing for the 24 Hours. But it__ more for me to get more of an understanding of what we can do with the car setup-wise and development.
That was the only day available before arriving here. It was a great day, nice and warm, and we did a lot of stuff, which I enjoyed _ just to help my understanding of that particular car. It__ quite different, yeah. But it doesn__ matter _ in any car, for me, Spa is amazing to drive. I__ not going comment on that. I cannot risk a penalty point. The thing is that I don__ know any better, right? I__e basically started with Red Bull, so I only know one car. And that__ how I drive. I adapt to it. Is it the best? Is it the fastest? Is it not? I don__ know. I just adapt to what I have _ or just drive what I have under me. And, yeah, it__ been performing for many years very well. We, as a team, have done great things. And this year, last year, other teams have also stepped up. Now it__ up to us to try and find more performance. But every car, I guess, when you drive on the limit, is not easy. I__ not going to comment. No, I mean, of course, I think teams are already focusing also on _26. So you try to get more performance out of this car, which is already planned for a while _ the steps that come. But at the same time, you know that _26 is a big opportunity to get it right as well.
So I think, from what I__e seen, what I__e heard, it__ been the right approach by the team. I__ in the middle, you know. Maybe good, maybe bad _ we__l see. I__ very open-minded, honestly. I don__ even think about it too much _ just enjoying the moment. When I sit in the car next year, we__l figure it out. I__ not making the rules anyway. Even if I have my concerns, it__ not going to change anything. So I__l just jump in and drive it, and then we__l, along the way, get better at it, understand it better _ like any regulation in the past. You keep optimising, keep improving, and then just go from there, really. I don__ need to go into that now. I__e had that question before as well in my life! Yeah. I don__ think we need to talk about that. I don__ know, do you want me to repeat what I said last year? I don__ know. It__ the same answer. I don__ even remember what I said last year, really. But again, it__ not really on my mind. Just driving well, trying to push the performance, and then we focus on next year. Is it out? I haven__ seen it on Apple TV. I was on Apple TV yesterday. I haven__ seen it pop up. Romantic comedies.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,Red Bull
Isack Hadjar,"No. It__ been probably the most consistent car, performance-wise. We never had bad surprises. It__ just you don__ design your car around Montreal, that__ for sure. It__ a very specific one. And I think going back to a more traditional track, the European rounds, we__e going to be much more competitive just like we were in Barcelona. It__ going to be the target. If the car is able to go to Q3, then I__l go to the maximum I can, to top the midfield. But again, it__ a track I really enjoy. I__e been competitive in the past. But every time you go in an F1 car on a track you__e been in the past with Formula 2 or Formula 3, it becomes a different track, to be honest. It__ so much faster, obviously. But yeah, I enjoy this. Sector 1 is more like pure braking efficiency and very slow speed, and then you go into very high speed. So, the track is kind of split in two, which I really like. Yeah, clear. Yeah. I mean, all the fights I had this year, they__e been clean and I enjoyed them.
I didn__ feel like I was reading a book when fighting them, so, following guidelines. It was really, really natural. At the moment it__ going well. Copy-paste from what he said. I mean, I don__ like having penalty points, that__ for sure, because then you don__ want to end up changing your approach. And, yeah, I think it__ very clean field, to be honest. So yeah, it__ not very needed. Well, I didn__ learn much from the movie because we have one driver, so it__ not much we__e learning. I think it__ just good that it__ going to hopefully send our sport into another dimension again _ make another step just like Netflix had this impact on the sport.
So hopefully this benefits us. I think it will. I mean, when I got signed by Red Bull four years ago, that was definitely the target _ to end up in the big team. I__ still on my way. At the moment I__ happy where I am, learning a lot. And yeah, that would be the natural progression _ no need to hide it.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"Well, I think it was quite unfortunate. We had an unfortunate Q1 exit, which put us on the back foot, starting from the pit lane, in a DRS train for 40 laps. So, it was a very frustrating race. I think the pace was not too far off to challenge the last few points inside the top 10, but starting from the pit lane obviously was going to be tricky. We got some learnings. We knew going to Montreal it wasn__ going to suit our package too much. And looking at the gaps this year, how tight it is, you can easily swing one way or the other, and we would probably be on the wrong side of it in Montreal. I wouldn__ say it__ difficult. I wouldn__ say it__ easy. At the same time, I think we know our weaknesses and we know our strengths. And at the minute, it__ very much about maximising the strengths. A tenth at the moment can move you three or four positions up and down the grid, and that__ why we__e got to focus on every single detail we can. The focus is going to be there. We know the car we have is going to be the car we love until the end of the year. The focus is on next year, and that__ our weapon and we__l try to get it in the best position we can every single time. To me, it__ clear on how hard you can race and the limit of it. Obviously, as drivers, you always take it right up to the limit and try to use any grey area that you can. But I think step by step, we__e reducing these grey areas. And I think it__, at least to me, it__ very clear on what you can do and can__ do. No. To me personally, I don__ feel that way. I think you go hard racing and you know where the limit is. There is mutual respect with other drivers and that__ the limit of the environment, and you try to push it to the absolute limit. Sometimes you go slightly over it. Now, the way we penalize is another question _ whether some of the penalties are too strong, not strong enough, etc. This is another conversation. But in the way that we go racing wheel-to-wheel, it feels natural. You know you__e not going to get a long answer from Max, right? Yeah, I mean, personally I__ not a big fan of penalty points. I think the level we have in Formula 1 _ we are professional in what we do. We obviously push things to the limits, but to have a race ban potentially_ I was in that situation a couple of months ago, and I don__ think I was a dangerous driver on track. So, for me, it__ something that can be reviewed, and maybe there__ another way of applying some sort of penalties without getting into the risk of having a driver missing a race. I just wanted to tell Max: they show you winning the race at some point, so you definitely should watch it. You__e going to enjoy that. Personally, I really, really enjoyed it. I think we__e already made a lot of comments about the movie, so I don__ want to expand too much. But it__ cool and really looking forward to seeing what the people think about it.
Hopefully, as Pierre said, it just brings even more fans and people enjoying our world of Formula 1. And yeah _ about Brad Pitt__ comment, I must say it clearly made my mom pretty happy. She was very pleased to be the first one in the family group chat to send it to all the family. So yeah, let__ see how the season goes, but hopefully we score a few more points. Otherwise, you might see me in Hollywood. Zero. I think it__ just the French side of me. I can play a French lover or something like that.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,Alpine
Oscar Piastri,"It was fine. Half of it was on the way to the Stewards' room, so that was fun. But, no, all good. We spoke about it honestly before we even got back to the team. Lando put his hands up and apologised. So, all good and looking forward to going racing again. Nope. Same as always. What happened in Canada wasn__ ideal, but we__e still free to race, still fighting for a championship each. So, no, keep going racing and make sure that we don't come into contact again. I hope not. We got taken by surprise a little bit that we weren__ as strong as we hoped in Canada, but hopefully it__ a one-off. By the time we got to qualifying, I think we were in a better place and in the race, our pace was actually not bad, just we qualified a bit further back. I think we kind of understand what went wrong in Canada. So, we'll try and have a better weekend here, but I__ confident we'll be back on top form. We do have some new parts, yes. I think some bits at the front of the car, and hopefully it makes us quicker. That__ normally the plan. Potentially. I'm not sure. I don__ think it__ made the biggest difference this year. We've seen at some races where it__ been cold, we__e still been strong. At some races where it__ been hot, others have still been strong. So, I don__ think it__ so much to do with the temperature or the weather. It__ just going to be how the track suits everyone__ cars, and hopefully it suits us well. Not really. I mean, we've been doing things in terms of strategy to just try and get the best result for each car. I was trying to beat the cars ahead of me, and we wanted to give me enough laps to try and pass them. It is a difficult position. I think the fact that we've got a healthy lead in the Constructors' Championship makes that a little bit easier to manage, but it's obviously a tough situation. I think we've done a very good job of managing things, of pre-empting things, and not being naive that, whilst it's a good position to be in with two strong drivers and a good lead in the Constructors_ Championship, it obviously does have certain aspects of that job. A healthy lead in the Drivers' Championship? Your version of healthy is much bigger than mine. I think, for me, I just want__nd we all want__ fair opportunity trying to win both championships. Especially in the Drivers' Championship, because ultimately, it can only be one of us. I think the situation has to change dramatically to start having those conversations, and they__e a very long way away at the moment. So at the moment, all I can ask for is a fair chance to try and win the championship, and that__ what I want as well. No, I__ not willing to enter those talks at all. No. We__e obviously been keeping an eye on them, whether they__e team-related or just power unit related. I don__ have any concerns, and I know the team doesn__ either. I think the biggest and most important thing was just that things remained fair from as many aspects as you can. Obviously, there are certain situations that are not always going to be completely fair__hether it__ strategy, because there__ only one pit box, or some other things. But I think that__ the biggest thing for both of us. Obviously, the first rule, regardless of whether it's written down or not, is that the two cars from the same team don't crash. I think that__ the big thing. In Canada, what we__e done well this year is acknowledging that it's a possibility. I think we dealt with it very well in Canada and since Canada. I don't have anything else. I think what we're doing and the way we're going about things is the correct approach. It__ obviously a difficult one to navigate, but that's a good problem to have in some ways. What we've been doing is good, and just a fair opportunity is what we both ask for. I think the first important thing to point out is that they are guidelines. They__e not set-in-stone rules. Trying to put in words every single racing scenario is impossible. So, it's a very difficult job. I think these guidelines provide the Stewards with some guidelines on what should be acceptable and what__ not. Obviously, there are still degrees of factors that can__ really be written down. Every situation is different, but I think it at least gives us as drivers some clarity on what is and isn__ allowed. There have probably been some tweaks since they came out__ can__ remember when they came out exactly, but maybe in the last 18 months or so. It__ just important that people don__ treat them as black and white__his is what needs to happen, this is what isn__ going to happen__ecause even if you wrote 10 pages of lines and a driver__ going to find a grey area just from the situation you end up in. So I think it__ important to recognise that and not jump to conclusions like, __t says this in this sentence, so this is what should happen._ It__ still in the Stewards_ hands. No. I think the situation is very different. I think Lando and I are very different people to Mark and Seb. I think the situation within the team, the situation in their careers, was also different. Also, the incident in Canada didn__ warrant any big discussions or big decisions. It was a misjudgement from Lando that he admitted to and apologised for immediately. I don__ think it needed anything else. We knew going into this year that it was probably going to be a close fight between Lando and I with a championship at stake, so it__ no surprise to anyone that we__e kind of in this scenario now. Ultimately, just trying to make yourself as fast as possible and do the right things__hat__ all you can do. I__e said it multiple times before, but Lando and I don__ just want one opportunity this year to win a championship. We want this to go on for as long as we__e in Formula 1. The headline a few weeks ago was: __t__ not wise to fight for a championship or win a championship and bring the house down with it._ I think that__ still very much at the forefront of our minds, and we want this success for years to come. Having the team united is a very simple way of doing that. No. I mean, obviously I__ enjoying the position I__ in at the moment. It__ a position I__e been in before in my junior career. I look at it quite simply: it normally means you__e doing something right if you__e leading a championship. That__ not to say there aren__ things I can improve on__anada was a scrappy weekend. There have been a couple this year that have not been as good as I wanted, but there have also been a lot that have looked as good as I wanted. Just trying to make every weekend look like that__hat__ the most important thing. What__ happening with anyone else on the grid, I__ not really concerned by. Ultimately, to try and win the championship, I need to put my best foot forward. If I do that, then I know it__ enough to win. That__ what I__ focused on and trying to do every weekend. No. I don__ think it will change anything. For me, I certainly won__ do anything different, I won__ behave any differently. If Lando__ going to do anything different, that__ for him to answer, but I don__ expect anything to change. We__e still got a long season ahead of us. I think it__ going to be a tight battle for the rest of the year. No. I saw the movie as well. It looked like a cool event, to be fair, but I was otherwise occupied.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"By surprise, no. But we knew that our race pace was going to be better than our quali pace. It__ usually the case. So, we did a really good strategy. I was very happy with that. Managed to fight with Carlos the whole race as well, which was a good surprise because we thought they were going to be quite a lot quicker than us. But yeah, it was very nice for our 200th Grand Prix that we managed to score some points. Took a while because there were a lot of decisions happening after the race in the FIA__ room, but it was all good in the end. We sealed the points, which was a good thing. I think it can go wrong very easily, but so far, definitely when we had the performance, we were sealing the opportunities. In such a tight midfield, you need to be taking these points every time__ven if it__ one or two__ecause you never know when someone__ going to have a great weekend and you suddenly recover all your loss in one go. So yeah, it can only seem like two points, but I__ not going to say it__ a victory, but it__ almost like a podium for us. It was a pretty strong race, and we need to keep that going, see how the car feels this weekend. It__ an interesting track always, and the team has done well historically here. So, we'll see if our VF-25 will work well here. We will see. I think it__ been great that the team had good races historically, but it__ good preparation because you can rely quite a lot on some data and what the team has done last year in terms of work. But we need to see when we put the car down in FP1, see how we are compared to the others and not arrive too confident, obviously. I think so. I mean, I thought that was public already before. So it is news to me. But yeah, I think that's a very good thing that it__ transparent for everyone. Yes. It__ a very good question because this is what we are trying to improve__ur consistency in terms of performance. The issue is how close the field is, especially in the midfield. One tenth can be three or four positions, or can make you go into Q2 or not, or can make you go into Q3. That__ the difficulty. A couple of years ago, you could be two or three tenths slower but still keep your position compared to one team or another. Now it really is about nailing the lap, nailing the set-up, and getting everything under control. If your car is not suiting the track well, you clearly have no chance in qualifying. You still have a chance in the race because it__ so close between everyone, but not in quali. That__ where the difficulties are. Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of rules, that__ for sure. I think the racing aspect is quite straightforward for us and very clear, but it__ all the little side things__ike what happened, for example, at the exit of the pit lane with that double yellow flag with me and Carlos. That was not that straightforward and a bit of a surprise for all of us. That caught Carlos by surprise as well. So yeah, it__ all these little things on top of an already complicated situation that can lead to difficult scenarios and going to the Stewards and having long decisions and all of this. In the end, I think the FIA took all the right decisions. They knew it was side things and small things not leading to any consequences. It was quite straightforward before I went to the FIA__ room, but it's always a stressful moment__specially when you get a result which means something. So yeah, the next three hours after the race were quite long for me and the team. Yeah, it was not something I thought I would experience one day in my racing career or my dream to get to Formula 1. Being there in the middle of Times Square with all ten cars behind was quite incredible. It didn__ feel real, really, but we were there and it was a crazy experience. First, to be in New York has always been a dream of mine__o really visit the city. I grew up watching Spider-Man, so for me, it__ quite special to be there. I had an interview, which is probably one of the random things I__l be able to tell my kids in the future: being in the middle of Times Square with the roads blocked, having an interview on the big screens all around - it was very impressive. The movie__ out now, people are able to watch it. I think it will boost our sport even more. Yeah, it__ true. I think it__ one of the highest altitude tracks after Mexico__robably the second highest. This is quite hard for us in terms of brake wear, in terms of temperature in general__or the car, for the engine. It__ tough on every component of the car. We__e seen in the past some teams struggling with this and having reliability problems. I heard it's about to cool down anyway for the rest of the weekend, so that should reduce our issues. But in terms of driving, the elevation is really something that I encourage people to go and watch in real life if they have the chance, because you don__ realise how it is until you see it with your own eyes. On TV, it flattens things quite a lot more. When you go and have a run with your team around the circuit, I can tell you that Turn 3 is quite a big one. For us, it is as well. When we're in the car, you brake super late__t__ almost like 65 metres to take a hairpin, which normally would be more like 100 metres or 90. For these guys, it__ 50. But yeah, it__ a really cool circuit. It__ iconic. It__ a bit of a shame in the past that track limits have been such a topic, but now with the gravel being put closer, I think it__ really a good sensation around here.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,Haas
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Well, for sure, it's good. In Barcelona, we brought this new upgrade that worked very well. So, we expect a jump again with the new parts. Obviously, we need to see how big it__ going to be, if it's going to be as much as the one we brought in Barcelona or a bit smaller. We are only going to know tomorrow on track, but I__ looking forward to it. The team has been doing a very good job developing the car, still in a good way, for this year, and finding some lap time. Hopefully, we're going in the right direction. At least that's what it looks like. We're getting closer and closer to fighting for points in a more constant way. Because so far this year, before Barcelona, unless there were big crashes ahead and a chaotic race, it was very tough to score points. From Barcelona on, I think we are at least in the fight now. Let__ see. Hopefully, this weekend will give us even more chances. I think I'm a bit more confident and comfortable with the car on one lap. Since the beginning of the year, the pace has been there in a one lap. Since Australia, I already felt quite comfortable. Obviously, I've been evolving since then and understanding a bit better how the car works and what it needs to go faster, from my side as a driver and also from a set-up side. In the race, I have a very experienced teammate on my side. Sometimes I feel like he still has a wider vision of the race than I do in the moment__hat is happening around him, the strategy he's going for, or the way he__ pushing or not at the beginning of the race to save the tyres. Stuff like this. Things you get with experience. As a rookie, you learn. And you can only learn doing these mistakes sometimes. I feel like Nico has been doing a very good job in the races on that side, also positioning himself in good ways in lap one. We are always starting very close to each other, but somehow these two positions make a big difference in the big picture of the race. So, yeah. So far, I'm quite happy. I feel like I'm extracting quite a lot of it in a one lap, as I said, and now we are making the jump in the right direction for the race pace. It's definitely positive. It's better than going to a track that you don't know, and you lose a bit of time understanding what you can do or not. But still, it__ a new track for me in F1, so it will be a bit different compared to F2. In F2, it__ much slower here in the high speeds. It__l be interesting. But I__ confident about it. I__ happy to be in Red Bull Ring. I have very good memories in this place, not only in F2, but in F3 and other series. Looking forward to the weekend. Well, I like this track. But since I didn__ actually have maybe great results here in the past, I always liked the way the circuit is made__he low speeds, the high speeds combined. I think it's a track that is quite complete in this sense. You need to apply different techniques of driving through the lap to be fast. I like this concept of tracks that you need to change your driving, adapt, and set up the car in a different way to behave in certain areas of the track compared to others. It__ just a bit like a mystery, and that__ why I like it so much. I think they said everything. I share their opinion, and, yeah, I stand on that. Yeah, it was a cool event. As Esteban said, in the middle of Times Square__t__ not something you have every day. It was enjoyable. I met Brad Pitt, so that was cool as well. I watched the movie in Monaco, but not again in New York. The movie is quite cool. I think people will enjoy it. It__ going to be a good thing for the sport. Oh, there__ a lot of drivers here that can be actors, I think. Well, I think Brazil__ last driver was Massa, right? Eight years ago, something like this. And obviously, we are a country that won a lot in the sport back in the day. There__ a lot of fans that didn__ actually watch Brazilian drivers winning in Formula 1 because they are new fans__ootball fans that saw Brazil win 20 years ago _ and they miss the feeling of winning in a sport again. Obviously, Brazil has not been successful in the football World Cup recently, and in motorsports, in the last years, in the sense of winning a title. Even if we do well, we don__ win a title. Brazilian fans are very emotional people__hat__ Brazil. That__ what I love about my country as well. I think those that understand the sport and understand the difference between the cars, and that it__ a sport where you can actually develop a car__t__ not that everyone has the same chassis like in junior series where you just play with the set-up and make your car fast__hose fans understand my situation right now. They just expect me to do better every race and improve with time and experience. But maybe some people that don__ understand much about F1 and they look at Senna back in the 1980s, they think you can get any car and win a race in Monaco in the wet. And it__ not like this these days anymore. It__ not that easy. Not saying it cannot happen, but this is okay. I don__ mind these comments. It__ okay for me. I do my best on track, and that__ what I care about.",2025 Austrian Grand Prix,thursday,Sauber
George Russell,"It's amazing to be back on the top step. Obviously, last time for us was back in Vegas. I felt last year was a victory lost. And then obviously we got the victory today probably due to the incredible pole yesterday. And obviously, so happy to see Kimi on the podium as well. So amazing day for the team. Thanks to everybody back at the factory who's been working so hard to get us back fighting for victories. And yeah, it feels good. No. It's a little bit cooler around here. You know, we saw it last year in Canada. I'd love to get our hopes up, but I think the strength of our car is in these cooler conditions and, you know, let's see going into the coming races, but we'll just enjoy it for now. Time will tell. Time will tell. I mean, we won Austria last year, so maybe that's a good omen. But, you know, we'll enjoy it for the time being. We did have high expectations coming into this weekend, and it worked out as we thought. So yeah. Good day. Good day. Yeah, it's been great to get the win and, you know, seeing Kimi up here as well on the podium. Really, really pleased for him. And, you know, as a team, we've been performing so well this year. Up until the last triple header, we'd maximized every single race weekend, whether, you know, that was the P2 in Bahrain or the other podiums we had. But coming into Canada, we knew we did have the potential to fight for pole and for the race win, and, ultimately, it came down to that quali lap yesterday. There was obviously not much movement in terms of positions shuffling around but really pleased with the job. I was, to be honest. There wasn't much tyre overheating even though it was hot. It's a very smooth tarmac here in Canada. There are quite low speed corners, so the tyres aren't under much stress. I think we expected a bit more tyre overheating considering the track temperature, but we're under no illusions that this really suited the strengths of our car the same way as it did last year. But for the majority of the circuits, we know it's a bit of a challenge, and that's why this is the first weekend both of us are on the podium. But it's great to see that when we get that chance, we take it. No. Not really. To be honest, for the last couple of weeks, obviously, there's lots of noise going on, after what happened in Spain as well. But from my side, you put it to one side, and you know that if you make a good start, you get into a groove. I knew I had potentially the fastest car today, you've got to dial into that and put all of the additional noise to one side. And, of course, it was a bit challenging at points when you had Charles and Lando on the offset strategy, and they were kind of getting in our way. But as soon as I had clear air, I could comfortably pull the gap out. It wasn't dead easy, but I felt confident in myself and the car. I was keeping a close eye on how Kimi was getting on, and on the TVs, and seeing Lando and Oscar closing down. But, no, it was a good day, and I feel proud of myself, feel proud of the team, especially after this time 12 months ago when it was a victory lost. It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt at all. But, you know, as I've said many times, I'm not concerned at all about next year. I know I'm going to be on the grid next year. I feel that I'm driving better than ever. I still feel I've got more in the tank. I feel ready to fight for a world championship, and I think results like today, results like Bahrain this year when we got half a chance of a good result, we're there to take it. And I'm pretty relaxed. Just enjoying the moment, enjoying my racing, and just taking it week by week. Yeah. It's definitely a special moment to win on Father's Day because, I mean, for all of us, our fathers have been such huge figures in our life and racing career. My father was at a go-kart track today with my eight-year-old nephew, go-karting, and starting journey number three of motorsport after myself and my older brother. And, you know, they got back after probably a six-hour-long drive this evening to watch the Grand Prix and then to win for him, the whole team, it's really special and it means a lot. No. I'm not talking with anybody else and any teams who have shown interest, I have been quite open to say my intentions are to stay with Mercedes. That's always been clear. And I am loyal to Mercedes. They gave me this chance to get into Formula 1. There haven't been any hard feelings with any of the talks that have been going around, especially around Max. Because, like I said on numerous times, why wouldn't teams be interested in Max? If every driver had no contracts for next year, Max would be number one for every single team. And that's understandable. But ultimately, there are two seats for every race team. I knew if I continue to perform as I'm doing, my position would not be under threat whatsoever. So, I feel in a good place. We're in no rush to do contract negotiations. We want to win together. Especially Kimi and I being team-mates now _ we're getting a result like today, both junior drivers from Mercedes, we're both doing the job in terms of performance. Why would you want to change something that's working? I mean, to be honest, I don't really know how Max and I are so close to those two because they clearly have the most dominant car. I think the two of us have been very consistent and getting the maximum result from our packages week in, week out. But I can't imagine them to continue throwing away points in the manner they're doing. Of course, we hope that continues to be the case, but I don't foresee us getting in the championship fight through pure pace as Lando did last year. We'll only be there if results like today continue or things like today continue to happen. My first podium obviously came in Belgium 2021, which was a bit of a unique race and very stressful for many different reasons, because scoring points for us as a team was far more important than the result itself. But it's a day you remember forever. I remember that day in Spa. I'm sure many people remember that day in Spa. I'm really happy to see Kimi here because it's a lot of hard work. As he said, the triple header was tough for both of us for different reasons. But to come back _ he showed a really solid race, had good race pace. That's what we need to do as a team to continue getting these points and try to finish P2 in the constructors_. Oh my god! A song to represent my win _ wow! That is such a great question, but I'm just going to embarrass myself with whatever I say here. Let me get back to you. It__ going to be a bit too much Taylor Swift if you look at my Spotify playlist. That took you long enough. For sure. So, we have this crazy German who's living in Los Angeles who has rejoined us this weekend. He's a friend of Valtteri's and is probably an inspiration for Valtteri's nude calendars and the mullet and all of this stuff. He's in the room with us today, and he__ the one who said, __f I win, we need to jump in the lake._ So yeah, thanks for the reminder. Well, I__ considering the calendar. You know? If I don__ have a contract next year, I need to bring the calendar out to bring the income in. So yeah, maybe. Is it clean? Could somebody let me know? He's shaking his head. Is it clean or not? Oh god!",Canada,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think so. It was quite a good race even though I think the two stints we were struggling quite a bit on the tyres. So we were doing quite an aggressive strategy. But luckily in that final stint, we managed to hang in there and actually the pace was a bit better on the bit lower fuel load. So that was good. I think we drove an attacking/defending race__ttacking with a strategy, defending of course with the cars behind. But it worked out for us and I think that was the maximum possible for us today. It__ a long, long season, you know. So you need to go race by race, and we'll always do the best we can. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's always a great weekend there. We've had a lot of great results, and hopefully, we can have another strong weekend there. No. Not really, to be honest. The first two stints, I was struggling a lot with the tyres. Just too much degradation again. So we drove quite a defensive race, to be honest, because basically two times, Kimi was about to overtake me, and we boxed. So that worked out quite well for me. We did a very aggressive strategy. I think the last pit stop, I was a bit worried if I was going to make it to the end competitively because on the hard tyre in the second stint, I was already struggling as well. So I think just a lighter fuel load helped a bit. But the gap wasn't that big towards George, and I never really felt like I had the pace to do anything. It was more about just looking in the mirror, trying to maintain that gap, try to look after my tyres to not overstress them. It was not the easiest race, but I think as a team we managed it well. I think we definitely optimised everything we could because, honestly, throughout the whole race, I never really felt like I was actually holding on to second. So, yeah, we did a good job. I mean, the whole weekend, I think the car was reasonable. Strategy-wise, we did the best we could. Well, I hope that we can start every weekend like this in terms of how I feel with the car, but overall, we do need more performance to be quick everywhere. I also think that this weekend was a bit, I won't say an off weekend, but McLaren wasn't as strong as normal. And, of course, we benefited a little bit. But if we go to all the other tracks now coming up, we definitely need more performance to even be close to them. This has been a good weekend for us, but we need a lot more to be able to fight with them for the whole season. A lot needs to happen for that, to be honest. We need to start winning races more often. And how do we do that? By being more competitive. Now, this was a good weekend, but again, not competitive enough. Like I said before, we have our moments where maybe we can win here or there, but we just need to make the car faster. Then we make it a lot easier for ourselves. We're working hard on it with the team. Of course, bits are coming, but is it going to be enough? I don't know. It's small margins in this world that can give you better results every single weekend. But what I think so far, what McLaren has shown this whole season is quite extraordinary and difficult to beat. So now, okay, one weekend is not as good, but they are still by far the favourites. And that's not going to be something that is easily beaten. But the coming races, we really want to try and improve our car. For me, it's not a surprise. I knew Kimi coming up through the karting ranks _ people were already saying great things. So I was keeping an eye on him. I think what's impressive is he's naturally quick. What I like is his level-headed, calm approach. Those are great qualities to have. I was never in doubt that the podium would come this year. He had a few unlucky races _ one of them in the sprint was also my fault with the pit stop. But it was just a matter of time. I'm very happy that it happened for him. It gives you more confidence. It's a nice boost. And it will only get better. You're in your rookie season _ there's so many things that will come at you. You learn from the weaker races, you learn from the good ones. In the coming years, for sure, we'll see a lot more of Kimi. Check your Spotify playlist. You should do the calendar.",Canada,post-race,Red Bull
Kimi Antonelli,"I mean, it was so stressful, but super happy. Had a good start, I managed to jump into P3. And yeah, just stayed up there at the front. And the last stint, I pushed a bit too hard behind Max, and I killed a bit the front left. I struggled a bit at the end, but really happy to bring the podium home. Yeah. I mean, I had a good launch, and I managed to get alongside. And then in the corner, I just tried to carry as much speed as possible. And then when I was alongside him in T2, I knew I would have had the advantage, especially going into T3, and really happy to stick that. I mean, that__ the goal. But yeah, definitely, this track has been good for us. The car has been incredible all weekend. And yeah, hopefully, we can carry the same momentum into the next few races. It meant a lot, especially after a difficult triple header on my side. Definitely took some confidence away, but this was the best way to bounce back. I was just hoping for the race to finish, to be honest. I was even looking at the screen counting the laps because it was very stressful. In the last stint, I pushed a bit too hard behind Max and eventually degraded the front left. The last few laps were a struggle, especially seeing Oscar getting closer and closer in the DRS range. At one point, he even tried to attempt the overtake in turn one. It took a lot of effort. Yeah, definitely. I mean, I'm still aware there's a lot of work to do, especially when it comes to qualifying, trying to be quicker at the beginning of the session. But we're on a good path. The team is doing a great job. Also, with George, he's helping me to push myself even further. There's a really good dynamic in the team. Hopefully, we can carry this momentum into the next few races. Well, it was much better than what I imagined. Hearing the crowd while walking onto the podium, I had massive goosebumps. That is definitely a moment I will remember for a very long time. It gives you a boost _ results like this and this feeling, you can't buy this feeling. It's an amazing feeling and you just want more. I think the goal now is to try to keep the same momentum and try to achieve more podiums, and hopefully maybe the first win _ you never know in the future. Racing in F1 with the 19 other best drivers on the grid gives you a lot of motivation. Having the chance to race at your best and show what you're capable of is a great boost. Of course, seeing what Max has done over the years, especially in his rookie years, was quite astonishing. So definitely he's a model who I get inspired by. But at the end, racing against the best is a great chance. And having someone like George as a team-mate really helps you improve. It's also down to George this result because he has helped me during this first part of the season to develop and push myself even further. It's obviously a great feeling to be the next Italian on the podium after such a long time. Now the next goal is to win, to bring Italy back on top. This result was needed. It's also for all the Italian Tifosi out there. Imola was an incredible weekend for me in terms of support. It didn__ go as well as I wanted, but seeing so much support already early on is great. So, this result is also for them.",Canada,post-race,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, to be honest, after how practice went, I'm pretty happy with myself at the moment. So, no, it was a nice turnaround. You know, there's always the question: do you want a medium or do you want a soft for Q3? And we went with a soft because we were having a lot of problems. We just wanted to keep things consistent. So, I'm pretty happy with it, which is a bit different this year, but I'll definitely take it here. Thank you very much. Cheers. Much better than practice, that__ for sure. I mean, honestly, I__ quite happy here in P3. After all the practice sessions, I was struggling, obviously. I didn__ have a smooth session this morning, and, yeah, everything just felt more back to normal. In qualifying, everything came alive again. So, you know, there__l always be the question__hould we have gone for a Medium at the end? But I think with how we__ been going in practice, having just a clean run on the same compound seemed like the best idea for us, and honestly, I think it worked well. So honestly, pretty happy. I mean, we always kept it on the table, but I don__ think we were ever that__r I certainly wasn__ ever that tempted. Like I said, practice was pretty miserable. So, I just wanted to have a clean run through qualifying, not introduce any variables that could have made things even more difficult. That__ what we stuck to. I think it__ been a strength of ours so far this year__ticking to our guns and doing what we think is best for us. Would we have been on pole position on a Medium? Maybe. But there__ also the risk that it goes wrong, and you end up worse than we are now. So, I__ pretty happy. I think so. Again, Friday didn__ look great in any run, but I certainly feel more comfortable now than I did this morning and then yesterday. Our pace on race days is generally where we__e strong. These two next to me were very quick in the race runs yesterday, so it__ certainly not going to be a slam dunk win, but I think we__e definitely in the fight. I__ not that concerned really. I__ obviously not going to get into too much detail on it, but I could have run it if I wanted to, and I didn__ really. It changes some things__ome things are better, some things are worse. It__ not as simple. It__ not an upgrade, it__ a different part. So, yeah, I had the option to run it but chose not to. I__e been happy with how the car__ been so far this year and, again, just wanted to keep consistency. I think for me, I__ not going to race any differently. I__ not going to take any less risk, any more risk. I__ certainly not going to do anything different. I__l race as I always race. I think we have struggled so far this weekend. In qualifying, we found our feet a bit more, and it became a little bit more normal. But apart from maybe one or two races in qualifying, it__ been very close a lot of the time. Today, you had the added complication of the Medium tyre versus the Soft. And like George was saying, it__ a track where they__e been strong in the past. The conditions maybe suited them more. There__ a thousand reasons it could be. But yesterday, we were on the back foot. Even this morning for myself in particular__ was not particularly happy. In qualifying, I think it__ just the kind of normal battle. That__ a bit of the price you pay for not being on top of things from the start. You miss that extra half a tenth maybe, and that can be the difference. That__ more or less what it was today. Obviously the gap was bigger than that, but again, with some other factors in there, I think we were in the mix but paid the price for a slightly messy weekend.",Canada,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think I felt quite good all weekend. The car actually was in a good window. I mean, this track is quite cool. It feels a bit like a big go-kart on the kerbs. And then, of course, you have the long straights, heavy braking. You need to be quite efficient on the straight, which I think we are in general. Yeah, so I'm very happy with qualifying. I think the car was again working quite well. Then, of course, the tough choice was the tyres, which one to use. But I think we did the right thing. I mean, I would always pick P1. You just start a little bit more forward, but it's fine. I mean, we'll see what we can do tomorrow. I'm already very happy with what we achieved today, to be on the front row, and hopefully tomorrow we can have a solid race. Thank you. No. It was fine. I mean, I made progress every qualifying. We planned it with a Medium like that, and everything worked well. So I__ happy with that. It felt okay yesterday. I mean, I was fairly happy with the car. You just need to look after the tyres. There was a bit of graining for everyone yesterday, so we__l try to keep that under control for tomorrow, also with the warmer temperatures. I think being on the podium, trying to be as competitive as we can be, trying to extract the most out of the car. But I don__ know. We__l probably find out after the race if we did so. But, yeah, hopefully we can just be good on tyre management. I don__ need to hear it again. It__ really pissing me off. I mean, you were speaking about it on Thursday. It__ such a waste of time. It__ very childish. So, that__ why I also don__ want to say too much because it__ really annoying, this world that we live in. No, I ust go race by race. I don__ really look at that at all. I mean, even when I was in the championship fight or leading, you__e not consistently thinking about it. Just race by race. Try to always maximise everything. Try to do the best you can. That__ why you__e breaking is so good? Well, I mean, the car has been the same as Barcelona, but I do think the team did a great job. When we arrived, the car was immediately in the right window. So setup-wise, I think the team did a very good job. And then, of course, it__ fine-tuning little bits and choosing the right tyres for qualifying. But overall, I__e been fairly happy with the car, which has definitely been a bit more hit and miss for us this season. I think we just also need to focus on the overall performance that we maybe are lacking sometimes. But also sometimes we are chasing the balance of the car. So it__ two different things. But this weekend, I felt good, and that__ why I__ also very happy, honestly, to be here today in qualifying.",Canada,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, today was awesome in front of this amazing crowd as well, to get the pole. I mean, to be honest, that last lap was probably one of the most exhilarating laps of my life because on my steering wheel, you've got the delta, and I just saw every corner I was going one tenth quicker, one tenth quicker. And I got into the last corner and I was, you know, six tenths up. I was like, alright, this lap is mighty. And crossing the line, seeing we were P1, was a real surprise, but I was, yeah, so chuffed with it. We__e mates, so it__ all good! I mean, I've got a few more points on my license to play with. So, yeah, let__ see. Yeah, honestly, it was probably the most exhilarating lap I__e ever done in my life because around this circuit you__e got to be so committed. It__ not easy. It__ quite bumpy. It__ so easy to make a mistake. You know, I think I almost found seven tenths on that last lap. Every corner I was going a tenth faster, a tenth faster, and it was just like the car was on rails. I just felt in such a rhythm, and crossing the line, when you do a lap like that, to get pole position afterwards as well was just insane. I had goosebumps in that moment. I don__ think I__e ever had goosebumps after a pole position or a good result. That one meant a lot to me. I think that was definitely the faster tyre today. We've seen it a few times before. The qualifying was a tricky session. The people who were at the front__t was always variable. In Q1, I was further down the order. Then Q2, I had a good lap. First run in Q3, I was a bit off the pace__hree or four tenths off__nd it felt like a good lap as well, but the Medium really gave me that bit of extra confidence. But I think the gap still to Oscar on the Soft was still almost three tenths. So, I__ not saying I__ have been able to do just as good a lap on the Soft, but the Medium__ definitely not three tenths better than the Soft. So I think whatever tyre we had on for that lap, it would have been the one. I think so. Every lap you do, the track__ always going faster and faster. Especially on a circuit like this, which is a street track, it__ a little bit windy, so you get a bit of dust on the circuit between the sessions. That__ why it__ always that very last lap in Q3 that counts, and that__ when_ It doesn__ matter how the whole weekend goes and we__ been having a really strong weekend up until qualifying, so the pressure__ on. If you don__ perform as well as you did in practice, it__ a bit of an underperformance. But, obviously, getting that result was mega. Right now, I__ not too sure. To be honest, we had good race pace on Friday, but it depends on the temperature. In practice, it was five degrees cooler than it was today, and the car was easily in its sweet spot. Now, it can easily go the other way tomorrow in the race. If the sun comes out__t__ a 2:00 race, it was a 4:00 qualifying today__hat makes quite a bit of difference. So, it__ not going to be an easy race and, you know, of course, got some really quick guys around me. We don__ know if it__ going to be a one-stop or a two-stop, so it won__ be straightforward. Yeah. I think, obviously, we__e both fighting for the win here, and neither of us are really in a championship battle. I haven__ had a win this year, so I want to get one on the board. Time will tell. I think, as I mentioned before, it really depends on these temperatures. At the moment, the tyres aren__ really overheating. And any circuits we go to where the tyres aren__ overheating, such as here, such as Vegas last year, we performed really well. McLaren__ou know, we saw them yesterday__hey were really on the back foot. So, it depends tomorrow. It__ something literally as simple as it clouding over that could give us a two-tenths advantage over McLaren. If the sun comes out, that sort of neutralises everything. I__ love to say something more than that__t__ a little bit out of our hands right now. But regardless of the conditions, we__e obviously starting in the best place. You know, we__e obviously all open to have our own views. I think what Derek said__ don__ think it probably offended anybody. Hence why we__e going to see him back. Principally, I think these days every word you say gets scrutinised, and that__ just the nature of the game we__e in. We also have to remember the stewards are volunteers. They don__ make an income from stewarding. They have a life outside of Formula 1 as well. We all speak to media in the paddock. So, yeah, if it was anything more than his sort of temporary__ot ban__ut his temporary avoidance of stewarding this weekend, I think anything more than that would__e been a bit OTT. So yeah. Yeah. I mean, well, one thing__ou know, in Montreal, you just can__ discount the weather or things happening on track. It__ a street track. You__e got to fight until the last lap of the race. And, yeah, last year was a poor race for me, and I felt it could__e gone differently. So obviously I__l be doing my best to make up for last year__ losses. But it__ totally different this year. As we said before, we don__ know how the race is going to pan out because the hard tyre is the one that we__e all going to use at some point in the race, and no one knows if that would do the distance to give you a one-stop or not. So, there__ that curveball in there. Yeah. Clearly feeling pretty good in the car. Always in these cooler conditions, it performs really well. Even_ we__e just comparing shoe sizes here. I struggle to get these in the car. Yeah. So, I__ lost now to where I was. Yeah. That__ why__ook at these! You know, braking is no issue whatsoever. So, yeah, absolutely. No. As I said, when it is cooler, the car feels great, and it gives me that confidence. And even throughout the course of Q3, over the course of qualifying, you know, from the start to the end with all the red flags, it was probably an hour and 15 minutes or so. The track cools down in that period, and it__ no shock that we were quicker in Q3 than we were in Q1. That is something we are, as a team, doing our utmost to try and improve because, of course, we take the benefits from today, but not every race is like today. And we probably have three races where our car is in the sweet spot. But it__ a 24-race season, and we need to find some improvements for the rest of the season. I don__ think any driver goes out looking to crash into somebody and get penalty points on your licence. Max is one of the best drivers. There__ no reason for him to race any differently, and I__ not sitting here thinking he__ going to give us more room. If anything, probably the opposite to try and prove a point. So I__l be keeping an eye, but ultimately, we__e all here to win. You__e not going to do something that__ going to jeopardise yourself from the race. It__ a busy season as well. If you get a race ban, you get a race ban and spend some time at home. It__ not ideal, but it__ not the end of the world.",Canada,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lance Stroll,"Thanks. Yeah, it's good to be here. It's good to be home, racing in Montreal. The wrist is feeling good. Pretty confident. Should be good. Yeah. Just because it was bothering me for a few weeks, over in Imola, Monaco. And then Barcelona was just really brutal throughout the weekend. I got a procedure done and drove this week, and I was feeling pretty good, so I'm confident. Yeah. It's just the old injury that I had a couple years ago. Just started to bug me again and, you know, so just got it sorted. I'm feeling good about the weekend for sure. I think historically we've been good here as a team. We scored points here the last few times we came, and it's a track I always enjoy coming back to. So yeah, just looking forward to it. Long time ago. I was a little boy. Thank you very much. Yeah. It__ my right one. A little bit, but it__ feeling good. Like I said earlier, but I__l say it again. I was in pain for a couple races. Barcelona was a lot of pain, so I got a procedure done, and now I__ not in pain. Yeah. I mean, as an athlete in any sport, you__e always trying to push through pain, discomfort, as much as you can to try and get a good result at the end of the weekend. In that situation, I was struggling and I was trying to push through it, but I just didn__ feel it was sensible to push anymore. I felt like the damage was getting worse, and I needed to do something more serious about it. I don__ really want to get into detail about what I had to do and how I had to do it because it__ just my medical privacy, and I like to keep that confidential. But all I can say for sure is I__ feeling a lot better. I__ looking forward to the race weekend. Being here in Montreal is always special. Good memories racing here every year. Good results over the years _ point-scoring results. I just love coming back here, racing in front of the home crowd, and I__ looking forward to the weekend. Yeah. I was frustrated for sure. Frustrated about my wrist and the last three races from Imola. It was just inhibiting my driving. So I knew that Sunday was going to be tricky, probably impossible. And at that point, I was pretty frustrated about it.",Canada,thursday,Aston Martin
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon, everyone. Yeah, pretty special day. I was fortunate to have a call with the Prime Minister and we were just discussing the work that is needed within education and the work that we're doing at Mission 44. He invited me down. I said, it__ really important that we get young people in the room. So, we brought some young students, some that are working within communities that are suffering in terms of kids getting expelled. So, we had all these kids from different backgrounds come in and speak directly to the Prime Minister. We're working on shifting several policies within education to improve school attendance, reduce exclusions, because I was one of those kids that was at risk of that and did get expelled. It's just the beginning of the work I think we're going to be able to do. They're obviously very focused on improving education in the UK. It was a really special day. I hope it's not the last time through that door, for sure. I think it's a Grade 1 building, so it's very old. You walk in and you're like, it needs revamping! But you can feel the history when you go in there. It's pretty incredible. There's a staircase in there that has all the images of all the Prime Ministers going back to the early 1800s. In the main room at the back, where we sat around this table _ big decisions, like Winston Churchill would have been sat there making decisions back in World War II. You could feel that. It was incredible to be there. Massively. Unfortunately, the team yesterday said they didn__ really want us to talk too much about it, but we both had issues that were hindering us massively from halfway through the race already. I didn__ know whether or not we had that problem, but I said on the radio that it was the worst-feeling car I__ ever had _ and it truly was with that issue. At the end of the race, I was like, __eez, I've never experienced something this bad for such a prolonged time through a race_. It wasn__ until after the TV interviews I got back to the engineers and we found out there was an issue. It was a bit of a relief to hear that because I didn__ feel so terrible afterwards. I was just made aware of it before I got here, so I__e not read the stories. It__ definitely not nice to hear that there are stories like that out there. Firstly, I love working with Fr_d. Fr_d__ the main reason I__ in this team and I got the opportunity to be here _ for which I__ forever grateful. We__e in this together. We__e working hard in the background. Things aren__ perfect. But as I said, I__ here to work with the team and with Fr_d. I want Fr_d here. I do believe Fr_d is the person to take us to the top, and so that__ that. To me, it__ all nonsense what people have written. Most people don__ know what__ going on in the background. It isn__ all easy, like, it__ not the smoothest sailing. We are having to make changes and there__ a lot of work to do. Naturally there__ a lot of pressure because we want to win, but that__ not any part of the discussion at the moment. I don__ feel that I__ searching. Of course, a good weekend is always a good thing, but I don__ feel like I__ in desperate need of one. I think it looks a lot worse outside than it probably is on the inside. Even just coming from engineering now _ how they set the car up compared to any other year that I've been here is completely different. And having discussions with engineers to change things_ There__ a certain way they like to work ands it's __old on a second _ that doesn__ actually make sense_. Like, this is what I__e done for the last 17, 18 years here, and it__ worked in a lot of them. So, getting those things to consistently work with the team and making sure you're working in a constructive way to make changes. The car has a real sweet spot, and we're trying to get it working at all those tracks, which everyone's having a struggle with. Yeah. I'm hoping this weekend can be strong. What year was that? I don__ know where I was then. I was 10. I also wasn__ here. No, I don__ remember watching that Grand Prix if I__ honest. Maybe I was racing or something. But I__e always been a big admirer of Jean. He__ one of my favourite characters of the older drivers. He__ always been so kind and polite to me, which is not always the case. Obviously, my Grand Prix win here was pretty epic. I was just talking to my engineers _ we just watched the qualifying from 2007, or my lap, for example. That was the race where_ back then with refuelling, the two cars were often separated by a couple of laps of fuel. One car would get the lighter fuel and I__ sure in some teams it alternated. And because Fernando was the world champion, he__ always get the lighter fuel. I was often carrying at least a tenth of fuel every time we went into qualifying _ until this race. I remember arguing after Monaco that I wanted equal opportunity and equal chance, and they gave us equal fuel. Then I out-qualified him and won the race. It was one of those moments where you really have to listen to your intuition and fight for what you feel is right _ and that was one of those high moments for me. That was our goal. I don__ think any sport has been so immersive in the sense of filming on race weekends. That__ been a real amazing opportunity for Joe and for Jerry. I think they did such a great job in how they approached it. We barely knew _ even though they had a whole team here _ we were all so focused on our jobs, but it was never disruptive to any of us. I think they captured some really great footage. We had a bit of a preview for the drivers in Monaco, which was really amazing for us. For me, it was nerve-wracking because it__ a four-year project and you want everyone to love it. Just before we watched it, Jerry said, __ook, just remember, we tried to make it as authentic as possible, but this is also Hollywood._ So it__ the best combination we could find of both. I remember on the days that I got to work with Brad, we were at Silverstone. We actually did a track day together in LA. I got to drive and he drove, and straight away I already knew _ you could sense he kind of knew where the lines were. He had a bit of a feel for it already. It wasn__ completely alien. I worked as a driver coach when I was a kid just to make a bit of money on the side, and I had some pretty bad drivers along the way. Just didn__ know where they were on track. Straight away you could see he had a concept of a driving line. I didn__ get to drive on track with Damson, but they both went to training. They were both super open-minded and really dove deep into what it takes to be a racing driver, which was really cool to see. Through that process, it was amazing to speak to Brad and see his shock. He__ kind of like, __eez. What are our bodies going through?_ _ especially when he got to Formula 2. He__ text me after the test, like, __y appreciation for what you drivers do is even higher than it already was._ So I hope that reflects in the driving in the race. I don__ really know how to answer that one. I mean, the times have changed. I would say the racing space has probably got a lot busier with the fame of the sport, so it's probably more intense. Maybe the media is more reactive, maybe. You__e got social media presence and online abuse that we didn__ have when I got to the sport. It__ been pretty amazing to see how mature the young drivers that have come in _ young men that have come in _ have adapted and how they__e carried that weight, because it__ no easy situation to be thrown into. When I got there, it felt like being thrown into the deep end without having the skills to keep yourself afloat. But there wasn__ the online stuff that you could see, and that__ significant. There are probably even more demands on the drivers today, outside of the car, than ever before. The thing I look forward to most _ it is one of my favourite Grands Prix. The track is very unique. I like coming to Canada. I just enjoy it. I__e always wanted to go to Vancouver and I just came from Vancouver _ it__ my first time in all these years. I get to go to BC in the winter sometimes. I know we both share an interest in heliboarding, heli-skiing _ we__e talked about doing it together at some stage. It__ such a huge country with so much to offer. But Montreal specifically for the Grand Prix _ I__e not been here when it__ not the Grand Prix _ during the Grand Prix, it__ just such a great vibe in the city. Great restaurants. The fans have been amazing since I started in 2007. Probably apart from my home Grand Prix, it__ been one of my favourite fan experiences. Maybe because the grandstands are really close to the track. You go somewhere like Austria _ beautiful circuit, beautiful countryside _ but if you go on the track down to Turn 4, the grandstands are so far away you need binoculars. Here, they__e right next to you as you__e braking into Turn 10, or coming through Turn 2 _ they__e right there with you. You get a different sense of that experience from a driver__ perspective. I think it__ amazing. I don__ really know what to expect with that. Every race I go to is unique in a sense _ it's my first time in the red car at that track. I heard there__ quite a big community of Italians here, which I didn__ know. So I anticipate there__l be hopefully good support here this weekend. Again, I don__ think that__ on the cards as far as I__ aware, and that__ certainly not something I would be supportive of. Embedding new people, new personnel _ whether it__ a driver or whether it__ engineers or people who run an organization _ it takes time to adjust, and the impact that has is significant. That__ not part of the discussion. I__ here to win with Fred. He has my full support. And also, to everyone writing stories of me considering not racing _ I literally only just started here with Ferrari. I__ here for several years, and I__ here for the long haul. There__ no question where my head__ at and what I__ working towards achieving with this team. So, there__ zero doubts. Please stop making stuff up. Honestly, it__ pretty amazing. I__ loving traveling to Italy. I haven__ yet found a spot there _ I haven__ made a decision exactly what I__ going to do _ but I am lacking in the lingo area. So that__ still something I__ thinking about. But I love going to Maranello. The more I see of Italy, the more I fall in love with the place _ with the culture, with the buildings, the architecture. There__ a real romantic feeling when you__e in Italy. Yeah, they make the famous pasta. That__ somewhere nearby... I don__ know if I__e seen that one. Is it? You__e been there? Oh, okay. No, for me, it__ the pizza that I love particularly. But honestly, it__ been a whirlwind of a year. I__e got great new brand partners that I__ working with. I__ working on new projects. I__e just released my collection with Dior, which I__ really proud of _ check it out online. It__ taken a long time to work on. I__e got lots of business ventures that are going really well. Everything generally outside of the racetrack is going amazing, and I__ working as hard as I can to make sure that__ reflected also in my results. So yeah, I couldn__ be happier in that respect. But I want to be at the front, obviously. Generally, we need to bring more performance to our car. We__e had one upgrade in Bahrain. Hopefully soon we__l have another. We__e also in that period where we have to start working on next year__ car. The car I__ racing right now is not a car that I__e had input in developing and evolving over the past four years. So I__ driving a car that Charles has obviously been a part of developing, knows very, very well, and has its challenges. But I__ enjoying that challenge.",Canada,thursday,Ferrari
Franco Colapinto,"Yeah. They were tough. They were not, of course, maybe as I was expecting. I was expecting to do a bit more progress after Imola, but it__ always tough to get back into F1 after six races of not being there. The drivers learned a lot, tyre management, and when you are not driving it__ really tricky. But I think it was really good, this break, this week off to get back with the team, to get back together and understand the issues, understand what we have to do better, where we were lacking some pace and where I can improve as well. So, it was good. I think it was a good break and hopefully it brings some performance for now. It__ very different. When I came into Williams last year, the only comparison I got was that. I never even drove another Formula 1 car. So I couldn__ really compare it to anything else, whereas now I have got that. In Alpine I__ learning a lot. There are many good things. There are some things that are different. The car is very different to drive as well, and it__ just getting up to speed with that and trying to understand what__ the weakest way around it. Last year that was Brazil. Here? I don__ know. Points? Points would be great. I think if we can get back up there, get a bit more of the performance of the car _ that I__ sure it has _ I would be really happy. So I think we have to start by getting to where we need, focusing on us and then think about the rest. I think it always helps to have a little bit of a break after a couple of races. Getting into a triple header is always difficult because you don__ have enough time to change things _ to change enough things. I was used to something so different, which didn__ give me enough time between races to reflect enough on it and learn and understand exactly what we need to do. I really trust that this break was really good for us. Hopefully it brings some performance back. Hopefully I can find a bit of that confidence I had in the car last year and find a way around it a bit more. We__l see. I think three Free Practices is enough to learn the track. Of course, getting up to speed quickly is going to be very helpful because we have a lot of things to test and we need that time in the free practice. Hopefully we can get up to speed quick and then see. But yeah, it__ kind of a street track, and that always brings a bit more emotion to us as drivers. At the end of the day, to drive an F1 around here _ such an historic and massive track in the history of the sport _ it's very cool. We worked on many things. Just generally there are some things setup-wise that have not been working for me. I felt very much almost out of phase with everything _ with the tools in the car, with the setup. One thing was fighting the other one. Once we understood that after the race in Barcelona, it made much more sense to me. I think here, I arrive with a bit more confidence. I spent a lot of days in the sim, a lot of days in the factory with the engineers so I can understand. Hopefully we made a step. We need that step, so hopefully we can do it here. The restaurant at the factory _ there__ that famous pasta... There__ one that__ ringing a bell... It__ good. No, I haven__ been there.",Canada,thursday,Alpine
Nico H_lkenberg,"We__l see about that. I think Barcelona is definitely a very high-speed circuit, and here it__ a totally different story__uch more low-speed, a bumpy circuit, big kerbs__o it could be quite different. We kind of need to verify and wait and see a little bit how it works here. Yeah, I agree with them. Isack has definitely had a very good run so far this season. The car is strong too, which obviously always helps. But to be honest, if I look at all of them, they__e all doing a pretty decent and good job, regardless of where you are on the grid. If I think back to my year and how troubled it was, I look at them and think they__e all pretty good. Yeah, good question. Well, on the car side, on the technical side, back then it was a lot more open. You had a lot more options on set-up__ven gear ratios, weight distribution. There were more things to play with, to understand, and to get your head around. So maybe there was another level of complexity back in the day. Now on the other side, F1 has grown a lot. It__ a much bigger stage. There__ more attention, more screening going on. So I think on that side, it__ harder when you come in now, with how the sport has developed and grown. It was a bit smaller and a bit more chilled back then, not so international, let__ say. I__ not sure, to be honest. Some moments I think yes, some moments absolutely not. These cars are really quick. There__ a lot of downforce. Sometimes it feels very safe. If you look at a lot of the races, we don__ have that many incidents nowadays__ot many yellow flags. Or if there__ an incident, it__ usually a big one because these cars snap and it usually goes in a big way. Back then in 2010, it was different in a way. It__ hard to explain. Yeah, it was smaller, lighter, different dynamic. You__e been watching a lot of onboards, huh? Yeah, we__l see how it grows the sport even more, but it was obviously interesting and nice to get a glimpse already or to see it. I think the public is going to like it. I think they__e captured more angles of the industry, of what teams and drivers do__ow much goes into it, especially preparation time and between races. Personally, I liked it. It was pretty cool. No, I haven__ had too many points of contact yet with next year__ generation of cars. It__ all pretty much theory and on paper for me right now. We all know that it will change, and I think it__ probably going to be quite different. But I think it__ going to be, you know, for everyone, relearning things. It__ going to be a very steep learning curve, especially in the first couple of months of the season. Relearning, getting your head around the new regulations, optimizing it, and finding the sweet spot. But other than that, I don__ know__ust speculating right now how it__ going to be or feel.",Canada,thursday,Sauber
Kimi Antonelli,"Well, I mean, it__ been quite a tough triple header on my side, especially because performance-wise I didn__ do that well, and then we had also a couple of issues. But overall, I think there__ still been a very big learning on my side, especially on how to manage busier weekends. Imola was incredible in terms of how busy it was and also time in front of the home crowd, and I definitely didn__ manage things the best way. So overall, it__ been quite tough__ot the way I wanted. But luckily, after these three difficult weekends, we had a week off and now I feel ready to be back on track tomorrow. I think, above all, the new C6__mola and Monaco____e been struggling to find the consistency in the tyre, just to find the consistent performance of the tyre. The C6 seems to be a super picky tyre, and it__ really difficult to put it in the right window already from the out lap. That__ what I__e been struggling with. In Imola, I was having such a swing of performances between sessions. In FP3 in Imola, I remember we were up there, and then in qualifying I suddenly lost five or six tenths compared to FP3. So I__e been really struggling to understand the tyre and to put it in the right window, and that took some confidence away.
That__ why I feel in Barcelona it was nice to get back into the rhythm. But at the same time, especially at the start of the session, it took me too long to get into the rhythm. That was also because I had two really difficult qualifying sessions in the previous two events. So definitely, I think that was the main issue. During the week we had off, I spent a couple of days at the factory doing some sim work and also trying to analyse the C6__nalyse when it went well, why I was able to extract the performance, and when it went badly, what I did differently. I__e been understanding quite a few things. Obviously, Montr_al is a completely different track__lose tarmac, a lot of low speed, and also quite cold eventually. So I__e been trying to really work on that in order to have a better idea, so I know how to behave better, especially this weekend. I think Hadjar__ been quite impressive. His qualifying form has been quite strong. So I will go for him because he__ definitely been up there and doing well. Well, for sure we need a linear weekend because it__ been a difficult triple header. Back to colder temperatures__ mean, last year, Mercedes here was super, super strong. This year, to be honest, it__ been quite different, quite unusual, because sometimes in places like Bahrain__ot really in my case, but George was, the car was quick, and there it was not that cold. But with colder temperatures, our car always goes pretty well. It__ a bit similar to what Liam said also before. This year, we__e been strong in places where last year the car struggled massively, and other places we__e been a bit less strong. It__ very important to find the right window because these cars are very peaky. Finding the right window with the balance can make a big difference. So I think it__ going to be really important to find the right way with the setup to be able to progress during the weekend and try to build from there. I__ super confident with the team. They__e doing a great job. There__ a good atmosphere. They__e really trying to put the best car on track. Now it__ time for me to do the rest. Well, you know, my dad is a great rock. He__ a big rock for me. He__ been there, teaching me everything since I was very little, since karting. I feel it__ very important to have someone like him at the track, especially in my rookie season in F1, because it__ a completely new world__uper intense and difficult as well. I faced three really difficult weekends, and I have to be honest, on the mental side, that__ not been easy, because here it__ like being in water full of sharks. If you don__ perform, you get eaten by the sharks. So it__ really important to be on top of it. I think having him helps to stay sharp, to stay focused.
We talk about anything, to be honest. We watch onboards together, we rewatch replays from previous years, and we try to analyse stuff in order to have a better idea and try to improve for the next session. Much more agile, the car. No. I would love to try, just to feel the way it__ different. Looking at the onboard, the car looks super agile. A bit, you know, moving quite a bit into the corner, but it looked fun to drive. Yeah, a lot! And these cars, as Nico said, have a lot of downforce and behaviour, and I feel like the downforce is playing such a big role in these cars. Back then, there was a bit less downforce, much smaller cars. I went not long ago to the Mercedes Heritage and saw all the cars. The difference in size between the 2010 and this year__ car__t__ massive. But I would definitely love to try one, also to hear the V8. I think that was nice as well. Not a lot more to add on what Nico said. I think they captured all the moments__oments on the grid, but also what__ going on behind the scenes, between races, the preparation that is needed, not only physically but mentally, and also the media side.
I think they really captured our world, and for the public, as Nico said, they__e going to like it. Well, of course, it__ not easy. What I__e been learning a lot is you have to be on top of the game since FP1, because then you find yourself a bit on the back foot, and most of the time, it__ hard to recover from there. Overall, there__ no reason why I should be intimidated by the other drivers. Of course, it__ great to race in F1 with the best 19 drivers, and some of them have written the history of the sport. As a driver, even though it__ my rookie season, it__ exciting to go against these kinds of drivers. It__ a way for me to test my skills, to challenge myself, and to see what I can do. At the same time, I have a lot to learn__ots of scenarios to experience and situations to face. The triple header, even though it wasn__ the nicest one, was still a massive learning for me. For the first time, I faced really difficult moments__erformance wasn__ really coming, didn__ have the right confidence, and I was struggling with the tire. It__ been a really good lesson, and I know much better how to react for the future. Well, it__ going to be very challenging, for sure, because they__e been fairly strong in the past few races. I think it__ really important as well, on my side, to bring back the performance because, obviously, George is doing a really great job. On my side, the past three races I haven__ performed as I should have, and I was very unhappy with how I performed. So I think it__ going to be really important for me to be back in the right form and to get back that position. What__ going to be really important is to be consistent, to consistently bring good performance and good results. Then, together with the team, try to do the best job possible__mproving the car as much as possible. On my side, trying to develop race after race. It__ not going to be easy, of course, but I think if we work well, it__ something that we can definitely achieve by the end of the year.",Canada,thursday,Mercedes
Liam Lawson,"It__ good to know that the car was fast last year, but at the same time, it__ quite often now that we look at last year__ results and, to be honest, they don__ repeat themselves a lot of the time. Tracks that maybe we haven__ been strong at, we__e actually been strong at this year, and vice versa. So I think we just have to take it like any weekend. For me personally, it__ a track that I__ very excited for. It__ an iconic place. It looks like a fun track. I actually spoke to Daniel last week about this track and he loved it. So, yeah, I__ looking forward to it. Use lots of kerb. That__ probably the main one. It__ a track where as drivers_ It__ a bit unique compared to most tracks that we drive on. It can be quite bumpy, and obviously there is a lot of kerb use around it. So, yeah, I think it__ unique, it__ something that we all enjoy, and I__ looking forward to it. Oh, I got a penalty for that. I think I got a penalty for it. But yeah, I__e had a few of those, so need to cut back on them. It is a track that creates racing, which is cool. Having double DRS zones behind each other always creates that, and big braking zones into hairpin corners. Obviously, the weather here as well__t looks alright at the moment, but in the past, it__ changed very, very quickly. So we have to be on top of it. Honestly, I have to agree. I__ the guy that gets to go up against him and see all of it. He__ done a really, really good job this year, especially in qualifying. His form in the last couple of triple headers has been very, very strong. Yeah, honestly, not too much to add. Especially maybe for anybody who__ not followed the sport in the past or isn__ into Formula 1, I think it__ probably going to bring in more fans, which is obviously good. I think the shots of the cars as well__ithout giving too much away__ere... I__ not sure what the word is, but well, impressive. Immersive, let__ say. So yeah, it was cool.",Canada,thursday,RB
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, definitely. It was a bit of a surprise to see Max try a three-stop, and it nearly worked for him. So, yeah, it was a great weekend overall though. I think the pace was really good. We could turn it on when we needed to and just very proud of the work we've done this weekend. It wasn't the best first practice and then we got our stuff together and, yeah, it's a nice way to bounce back from Monaco. So, been a superb weekend. Hard to complain. Yeah, very hard to complain. It's been a great year and this weekend's been exactly the kind of weekend I was looking for. You know, we executed everything we needed to when it counted and that's all you can ask for. So, the team gave me a great car once again. It's a lot of fun winning races at the moment. So, I've been enjoying it, and I hope the team are too. So, thanks to the crowd for being out here. It's been a great weekend, a lot of support out here. A lot of traffic as well, but that's the sign of a lot of fans. So, it's nice to be here. I've seen that [Nico] H_lkenberg finished sixth [sic, P5], which is pretty impressive. So well done to him, I guess. But, yeah, my restart was okay from a time point of view. I'm not sure my rear tyres were very happy. I think I was wheel-spinning in sixth gear. So not the cleanest of restarts, but it was good enough. And then just getting used to how much grip there was on low fuel again, it was like being back in qualifying. So that was a bit of an adjustment, but no, very well managed. No. I used my own. No, it's chocolate flavoured. Sorry. We're just discussing deodorant here. [To Lando] You can get a better whiff, if you want. Your question was about managing it from the car? It felt mostly under control. I think I wasn't really expecting Max to try a three-stop race, and I wasn't really expecting it to work_ Well, almost work as well as it did either. So there was a bit going on at that point definitely, and just with all the traffic and the blue flags as well, that made the race a bit more interesting than I wanted. But, apart from a few laps trying to get through the blue flags, I felt pretty much in control and could increase my pace when I needed to. So, yeah, it was a really strong race and a strong weekend. I think we did a really good job of managing everything in that race: sticking to our plan on strategy, not getting distracted by the three-stop, really good pit stops. Yeah, I think we just did a good job all around. It's definitely up there. I don't know if it's the best one, but certainly it's been a strong one. You know, it's pretty hard to complain with the results we've had this weekend. And I think more so than that, just the effort that's gone in, and analysing some of the things from last week that we could have done better__ think we turned it around very nicely and got back to the form we wanted to be on. And, yeah, that's what I'm very satisfied with this weekend. Definitely one of the strongest. Team-mates _ with you_ so fun! In all honesty, I don__ fully get the context of what happened. It looked a bit strange. Like, I thought he was giving the position back_ So I don__ really get what happened there. I don__ know if it was a misunderstanding, whether he didn__ brake_ I don__ really know. I think I need a bit more context on what happened, but obviously it was not exactly a small touch. I don__ have that much more, but it obviously didn__ look great. I have no idea. I don__ know. I think Imola, we probably expected to be a bit quicker than we were, and we got beaten. I don__ know. I think this weekend, we were probably a bit quicker than we expected compared to Red Bull. I think we thought they would be a really genuine threat this weekend. You know, I think they were with us in the race, but more through strategy, I guess, than pure pace. But it seemed like we had a little bit of an edge over them. So, I don__ know. There will be other tracks where our competitors get closer. There__ probably going to be some where they__e further away. I hope there__ more where they__e further away than closer. But I really don__ know.",Spain,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"I did, yes. But, you know, Oscar drove a very good race today. Didn't quite have the pace to match him, but we gave it our best shot. It's a long race, you know, anything could have happened at the end. We both got pretty sideways with the Safety Car restart. It was a good fun race, you know, and for us as a team to finish one-two is even better. [To Oscar] Did you use my deodorant? Is it a female one? To finish second? I'm not sure. I mean, obviously, I got past Max quite quickly_ Were we? Yeah? You know. I don__. I don't remember. I just remember the lights going up pretty quickly, and obviously I was a little bit caught out by that. So, yeah. And then I just couldn't get a slipstream. Yeah, I just_ Oscar didn__ give me a slipstream down to Turn 1! And then, you know, it was hard to commit into the braking of 1 and Max got past. So it was a long race. I think we knew our pace was going to be strong, so I didn__ need to do anything too risky into Turn 1. But, yeah, I don__ think I lost out in the race. I think Oscar drove a very good race today and had a good day yesterday. And, yeah, I had the pace to go with him, but not enough to try and catch up and put him under threat. Oscar told me he had some interesting opinions on it, so I__ going to pass straight over to him. It__ not what he said earlier, but__eah, again, I don__ know what happened. I__e not heard what Max has said, and I__e not heard what George said, so, I don__ think it__ something for me to comment on for now. I mean, I hope not, but the team are doing a very good job. We have a lot of good competition. There was a lot of complaints about our car, and they introduced this TD and changed nothing. The team have done a very good job to just give us a good all-round car and the best car on the grid. So, we__e very proud to be able to go and drive those cars every weekend. So, it__ credit to the team that we have to give day in and day out. But like Oscar said, there__ still places where we__e vulnerable, especially in qualifying as it gets very close. Obviously, yesterday was the biggest margin of the year, but I think people seem to quickly forget how close the other qualifying sessions have been. They__e been split by hundredths and thousandths, and there hasn__ been smooth sailing for us in every single one. So, I think that will be the case in future ones. But it__ clear we just have the best car on average, and we still seem stronger in the race. Although, it__ clear that the others are catching up. Our gaps in the race were probably a lot bigger in the beginning of the year than they are now. So I do think that our competitors are catching up. But, yeah, we just need to keep our heads down and keep working hard. Yeah, it__ tricky. I mean, sometimes, you don__. Sometimes you don__, even when you want to be thinking of all the positives and things like that. But I think what I__e learned more to do is turn those thoughts into productive things. Turn them into ways to improve, to understand things. Turn them into positive attributes, I guess, rather than letting them bring me down as much. But I think it____ don__ know if it__ all normal, but I__ sure a lot of people have similar things. Everyone has those great days. Everyone has bad days. But yeah, I don__ need other people to tell me things. I have my own team, my own people around me who tell me when I__ doing good and when I__ not. And that__ all I really need. I don__ need other people, and I don__ need to listen or look at anything else. I only care about those people who are closest to me, who understand me and know me. But also, having them around__ike having a good team around me__s probably one of the most important things because I still love those trickier days. But, yeah, the main thing is understanding them and learning how to turn them into productive, positive things.",Spain,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah, it was, I mean, it was a battle for the track position to get the slipstream of the guys in front. Max wanted to bring me towards the inside where there's all the rubber, so I didn't want to go too much there. So, I was trying to push him to the left. There was a little bit of contact, but fortunately for us, no consequences. But I'm really happy. Obviously, yesterday I sacrificed quite a bit in qualifying in order to have better tyres for today. I didn't know whether it would pay off. At the end, it did. I think P4, in a normal race,  would have been in our position. With the Safety Car, we got lucky and got a podium. So I'm really happy with that. Yeah, I mean, when my engineers told me that Max was going on a new Hard for the last stint, I don't know if they had the choice or if they had no choice. I guess they had no choice. I was obviously very optimistic because I knew how bad the Hard was. And, yeah, that's where I thought that I really need to have a good restart, and maybe there's an opportunity, and there was. Yeah, I just wanted the slipstream in front, but it all worked out well. Well, I mean, from the moment where I knew that Max was on a Hard tyre, I was like, __K, that__ not a great tyre to be on for the last five laps_, especially if there__ no saving or whatsoever. So, I knew that it was a full attack for me and that there was an opportunity to finish on the podium. Max went with a lot of commitment in the last corner, lost the rear on exit, and then I was basically side by side, and I was very happy to take the third place. And then we touched on the pit straight. I mean, I probably would have been very vocal if it was the other way around as well, because you are fighting for third place. So, you are just trying everything to get that third place back, and I think he knew that on track it would be very difficult with the tyres he was on. So, yeah, I mean, honestly, I don't have any particular feeling about it. There was nothing special. I overtook on the inside. He tried to squeeze me on the dirty side of the track, then I had the upper hand because I had more speed because of the mistake he had done. And then I was trying to take the slipstream of the McLaren, went a tiny bit to the left. He didn__ seem to want to move at all. And we touched a little bit, but there was nothing special. Today, we finished on the podium because we were lucky with the Safety Car. Otherwise, I think fourth was our position. So, I don't think I have much more confidence in order to finish on the podium consistently. But, yeah, we are getting there. I guess we start to understand the car, how we can set it up in order to extract the maximum out of it. But still, we need to go in quite extreme directions, which is not so nice to drive. So, unless we have upgrades very soon, I think it__ going to be difficult to be fighting regularly for podiums. Yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm over the moon for a second or third place, but it still feels good because coming to the weekend, I did not expect that, but so didn__ I last week as well in Monaco. I think though in Monaco, the disappointment was big because in FP1, FP2, FP3 we were very strong. It was not the case here. So, we weren__ strong in FP1, FP2, FP3 or qualifying. But I knew I had sacrificed quali yesterday in order to be strong in the race today, and it seems to have paid off__ith a little bit of luck as well__hat gave us the podium. So on that, it__ a good surprise. And I__ very happy about our weekend, but I__ not happy about our overall performance. And on that, we need to do a step soon. No. Because the first Medium was really good. I think the other Medium wasn__ great. The last Medium wasn__ great. I was trying to manage as much as possible because I knew I had to do a bit of a longer stint, because all my competitors were going longer on the second stint to have a shorter third stint. So, I was just trying to manage those tyres. So, I had to compromise a little bit the last stint, but it__ not like I expected to be super quick. I just thought that for our situation, it was the better way to go, and I think today confirms it.",Spain,post-race,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, very happy. It's been a good weekend so far. It didn't start off in the best way _ we were struggling a little bit _ but I think last night we found some pace. And today, the car's been mega, and I feel like I've been able to put in some good laps as well. So thank you to the team for all the hard work. This was a pretty miserable scene 12 months ago, so to have turned it around in the best way is a great result. Yeah, I improved quite a lot in Turn 1, actually. And then there were a couple of other places in the lap where I__ been struggling a bit all day. I don__ know if I necessarily did better, but it all just came to me mainly in the first half of the lap. And in the second half, could just about hang on. It wasn__ the perfect lap, but I think around here, with the tyres going off so much through the lap, it__ very tough to do that. So, I__ very, very happy with all the work we put in. Yeah, definitely. It's going to be an interesting one tomorrow and I__ pretty glad that I__ starting from pole. It's obviously a long run to Turn 1, so I__e got to make sure we try and get a good start tomorrow. But no, very proud of the work we've done today and starting in the best spot. So, I can__ thank the team enough, and hopefully we can have some fun tomorrow. It was pretty good. I think Sector 1 in particular felt quite strong and halfway through Sector 2. The back end of the lap was a little bit trickier, and I'd actually lost a little bit of time. But I think here, if you use up your tires in the first half of the lap, the second half becomes very tough. So clearly, it was good enough, which is a great thing, obviously. The car's been feeling really good today and I've been able to put in consistent laps, which has been nice and a bit of a contrast to yesterday. So, it's been a good day. I think it had been a good run through practice. FP2 felt strong this morning, and FP3 I felt pretty strong. So, I was pretty confident that was on the cards in quali. I obviously knew that Lando was going to be quick, but I also thought that the others would get in the mix as well. So yeah, it was nice that we had a bit of a gap as a team. I always felt pretty confident that I could achieve this today, so glad that we pulled it off. There wasn't any really. I learned that after the fact. But yeah, I knew I had some corners to tidy up in the first half of the lap, which I felt like I did a good job of. And then, I don__ know, maybe I just got too excited for the second half of the lap or I don't know. It wouldn't be the first time. Maybe it was just a lack of talent in the second half, but I think when you push the tyres like that and get everything out of them, there probably is a bit of a price to pay because the last sector, the corners are so slow and so long. So, if I was to do it again, maybe I'd tweak it slightly, but I don't really care now. No. Not because of the technical directive. No. I mean, every weekend we've gone through, there's been some things to fine-tune, but we had the same problems as usual. So, it was nothing new. Crossing the line first, Tom. That's the key! I mean, yeah, I think trying to get a good start and keep the lead is a good idea probably. But there's going to be some strategy involved tomorrow. The long runs yesterday were pretty painful for everyone, I think. So, it's going to be a different race to a lot of the races we've had this year. Hopefully, a bit different to last weekend. I think it will be an interesting race still and it's not as simple as take the lead at the start and cruise from there. It's going to be a challenge to manage the tyres, timing your stops right. There's going to be a lot going on. I'm not sure I want to go under the name Ice Boy! I think the emotions are different each time. Certainly, there__ been qualifyings and races where it__ not been nonchalant and there__ been a lot of emotion behind them. But then there__ others where you go out and you know that if you do a good enough job, you can achieve the result you want. Don__ get me wrong, it__ incredibly satisfying, but I think I__ just not a particularly emotional person. That__ just how I am, really. Don__ get me wrong, there are still moments that I am emotional, but I also know that today_ It__ a nice thing to have, starting on pole, but it__ not the end of the weekend. The points are tomorrow. After the races, it depends a bit on the race. If you__e had a battle with someone the whole race and then you win, then yeah, you__e pretty pumped up. But if you__e got a bit of a gap, then you kind of know with a few laps to go that it__ going to go your way, and then it doesn__ spill over so much. So yeah, that__ just how I am. I went out very early for the first run of Q3 and I think it was just coincidence that Lando ended up behind me opening the lap. Of course, when you cross the line to start your lap, it__ maybe not the nicest feeling, but we__l discuss it. There was nothing untoward going on. Unless Lando__ going to spill his master plan that him and Will had! But I think it was just coincidence.",Spain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Oscar drove very well. I think the pace is definitely there. Just a couple of little mistakes, but yeah, didn__ do it. And Oscar, like I said, was driving well all weekend. So, a good result for the team, a nice one-two, and an interesting start for tomorrow. I mean, hopefully not. Hopefully it__ just an easy race for me. But no, I expected it. It's a long run down to Turn 1 _ normally always interesting. I mean, we__e got a lot of quick guys behind us, so we won__ count them out. But no, good result for today. I'm happy. We do. We have the best one. Yeah. For sure. Just a couple little mistakes. Turn 1 _ which is kind of the first place you don't want to make a mistake, just because it harms the rest of the lap with the tyres and things. So just a couple of little squiggles there and the exit of Turn 4 as well. So just not a perfect lap, not the cleanest lap, but still improved, surprisingly. So the pace was easily there. Just a couple too many mistakes. Yeah, good. We've been good in all conditions so far. It's obviously very hot. So, like Oscar said, just a bit of a struggle for everyone. It's a struggle in quali to look after the tyres for one lap, so the race is then much trickier. But the car has been good the whole weekend, as you've shown today. So yeah, that's always reassuring before Sunday. Hard to say. It was short-lived, but rightly so. So no, don__ think so. Yeah. The speed was easily there today. And sometimes you just don__ put the laps in. Today was good. I think I was a little bit behind at the start of qualifying and I caught up nicely. I know where I lost that time on the final lap. It was just trying a little bit too much and just not being quite tidy enough _ especially around a lap like Barcelona. One little oversteer in Turn 1, Turn 2, you kind of already know it__ going to be a tricky rest of the lap. So, it__ still good. I still feel fine. I__ happy with second, especially in Barcelona _ it__ not the end of the world. So, a positive weekend. We planned it the whole weekend! No. I didn__ know Oscar was going out first, to be honest. I tried to get a slipstream from someone. I think I was unlucky that it was Oscar. It was just a coincidence. I was tenth or something in the queue. I don__ know who I__ going to get a slipstream from because you__e waiting two minutes in the pit lane. So yeah, just coincidence.",Spain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"I guess so. I mean, I think we were lacking all weekend, of course, compared to them. But I think we executed well. And I think, yeah, that third position is where we more or less should be, even though I think it__ quite close behind as well. So yeah, it__ fun. I mean, around here squeezing everything out of the car _ the grip is always quite good even with the hot temperatures _ but yeah, let__ see tomorrow what we can do from there. Not too much. I mean, I think we had quite a decent Friday actually, and we just made some final changes to the car. But yeah, of course, unfortunately, it wasn__ enough to really challenge for pole. But yeah, it's okay. Yeah, I__l try my best, but they will be tough to beat. But we__l see what we can do tomorrow. Yeah. It was fine. I think it was consistently the same delta behind. So Q1, Q2, Q3. Just my first one in Q3 was a bit more difficult because we tried a different out-lap approach and that didn't work. But yeah, clearly just lacking a bit too much. Sector 1 was quite tough. Turn 1 was never really good, even though I tried different approaches, but just didn__ seem to find the grip there. The rest_ It was fine. The car was in a decent window. Unfortunately, not fast enough, but I had fun out there. The car, around here, qualifying flat out, fast corners, it is really enjoyable. When? No. It__ going to be tough, I think. My long run wasn't bad, but if you look at the difference today, it will be tough to put up a really, really good fight. But that doesn't mean that we're not going try. So, we'll see tomorrow. I think it's time to shine in Turn 1, yeah. Make it three-wide for the pictures. Why not? I don't know. Honestly, I think looking at pace, it will be tough. Like Oscar said, it__ not all about the start and Turn 1. You need to be good on tyres. It__ a long race. A lot can happen. So, I__l just try to maximise what I got.",Spain,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm a bit tired because I was almost late and I didn't want a fine, so I ran and I'm a bit tired now. But I'm happy to be here. Good vibes yesterday in the fan forum, getting a lot of support from the home crowd here. I don't know, it just always gives me good vibes. It puts you in a good mood, and the whole weekend makes you keep a smile on your face everywhere you go. Just hearing people cheer for you is the best feeling. To have a home race and get to have it every year__ feel very happy about it. And, yeah, I just want to go out there this weekend, enjoy it, and try to give them a good result and a good show. Probably, if I had to design a track for the FW47, it wouldn't look like Barcelona. We don't tend to like medium-speed, long-duration corners. But I'm hopeful. It's a track where we can also show the progress that we've made over the last few years. Apparently, the team was P19 and P20 here last year. We haven't reached Q3 since 2020, Q2 since 2021. That kind of speaks to the kind of track we're facing this weekend. But I'm confident that this year's car is a step better in all these corners and we're going to show better performance. Yeah, there's been obviously a lot of talk regarding this. I don't think it's going to affect teams and people as much as people think or as much as is being made about this change of regulation. It's still a front wing and still will be, just obviously run a bit stiffer and it will not flex as much as it did. I wouldn't expect more than one-tenth swing up or down through the field for each team depending on how much you were flexing or not. That is true, actually. Especially in our little midfield area. Yeah, but I also think nowadays we have a lot of tools__echanically and aerodynamically__o tune these cars. So even if it's going to be more of a challenge, we still have three practice sessions to see where the car is at in FP1 and take steps to fine-tune it and get it back to a decent place. You can imagine teams also in the simulator have been running endless laps just with a new wing. Nowadays, F1 teams are too well prepared, ion that sense, to be caught out by this kind of change. Yeah. I think the best example is still Monaco. I think we were all expecting to perform a bit better in Monaco, but we did some mistakes with set-up choices and the way we did our tyre prep in quali that compromised our performance that weekend. We came out finishing P9 and P10 and we were frustrated. I think if you had asked Williams a year ago about a P9 and P10, a double points finish, it would have been a great result and the team would be celebrating. A year later, it__ not enough. We know we can do better than that. Barcelona might be a weekend where a P9 and P10 is a good result. We need to keep that in mind. I think we__e heading into our most challenging track since China. A lot of new things to look into with the change of regulation. So we__e going to need to keep a good eye on how the weekend develops and see if we can perform at a good level. I__ confident we can, but on paper, it__ not the best track. I think it__ a conversation that we need to have amongst drivers and maybe come up with ideas for FOM and FIA to think about. I think there__ no one better in F1 than us as drivers _ we get to be in the car and realise how easy it is to manipulate the race or to defend, and go three or four seconds off the pace and still finish in the same position. So we all need to__or the benefit of the sport__it down and see what is not the best solution, but the most easy to apply or the common-sense kind of solution. We will all have a think about it and come up with ideas and see what can be done or not. Obviously, FIA and FOM went for the two-stop idea. Clearly, it didn__ work, at least in the midfield. Although I always welcome something new and experimental to see if it can actually work. I feel everyone would benefit in the decision-making process from including us drivers in this conversation. I really believe the sport would benefit if instead of trying something top-down, we all sit together at a table and, with the ideas of the drivers, let FOM and FIA know and put together a solution that actually works. I__ very happy with these first eight races. Happy with the results and the momentum the team is carrying. If you had asked me a year ago, when I signed the contract, that in some qualifyings we would be only three tenths off pole, and beating a Ferrari or Red Bull or Mercedes__ would have definitely signed the contract even earlier and even happier. The team is on a very strong trajectory. My adaptation process is going well, even though I don__ have all the points in the championship that I think my performance should reflect. Points is not something I__ caring so much about this year. I__ caring more about the speed I have with the car, the way I feel with the car, and how we can improve both the handling of the car and how we handle weekends, strategy, and execution. That__ been a bit of our weaker point. That__ why we don__ have many points in the championship. But as long as the speed is there and I__ quick with the car, this will come with more races. Yeah, I agree with everything they__e said. Nothing really to add apart from maybe I__ a bit more open-minded to see how we could improve the Sunday and what kind of ideas we could come up with to improve the Sunday. I still want to race in Monaco. I still want to try and overtake someone and have the pressure of the start, the lights out, the pit stop__hat__ still there to stay. I agree with Lando that maybe quali should be given even more importance given how important it is there. But I__ still open-minded to see if we can come up with solutions to make the Sunday a bit better. Because honestly, that Sunday was painful. It was not a good Sunday for all the midfield guys behind me or in front of me doing the train. I__e never jumped out of a car so disappointed, almost, with the whole thing because it was really, really, really bad. It was very slow__ike the slowest I__e ever gone in a Formula 1 car. So yeah, something to look into. Yeah, I__l tell you what I think. He suggested three minor changes to, I think it was Loews_ One option was the chicane after the tunnel, to delay the entry and maybe make it a bit tighter, a bit further down the road. He made Loews wider, the entry of Lowes wider, and the entry to Rascasse a bit tighter. Those three changes. My opinion _ that would help, but only 1 to 5% of the issue we have. I think you could still position the car in the middle of the track, go 30 km/h, and still not get overtaken. You would need to be a bit clever about it and maybe more worried looking in the mirror in case someone sends one on the inside because it__ a bit wider. But the cars are so wide you can go as slow as you want__hey__e not going to pass you. That__ why we were driving four or five seconds off the pace. So small change, small benefit. I think we need something even bigger than that. I definitely think so. I think someone that is capable of winning the Indy 500, at least he should at some point be given the chance to show what he can do in Formula 1. And if he__ quick enough in Formula 1, then he should be welcomed in Formula 1. I think he got to test the McLaren car a few times? How was he? Quick? He did FP1 once, no? I always rated Alex very highly becuse I was his teammate in cadet and he was very quick in cadet karting. But honestly speaking, what he__ doing in America is something really admirable. I think to dominate in the way he__ dominating, you have to be very good at what you__e doing. Then Formula 1 is a completely different discipline, different world, but I don__ have anything else but respect and admiration for what Alex is doing in Indy.",Spain,thursday,Williams
Lando Norris,"Yeah, it was a lovely dinner. Really nice. Obviously, I was sat at the big table. And, I mean, it felt great because it's an honour to be there__ou only really get to go as a driver if you win. So, it's a good thought. You get to chat with their highnesses and have a nice time. So, a nice dinner, all in the moment of celebrating the weekend, celebrating the win, have a little chat, and that's all. Some nice food. I mean, it's special for different reasons. Was it probably the hardest-fought race? Probably not, but that's Monaco. Is it the one that means the most? The one with the most pressure on a Saturday? The one everyone wants to win? Then yes. It__ more just the meaning behind it__he history behind the week itself, the racetrack, the people who have won there. The prestigiousness (sic) of where it is and what kind of event it is. So is it the one I'm probably most proud of? I would say so. One that I__l remember forever. I think it__ everything everyone talks it up to be and more. Because it__ something that you__e proud to say, it's not just any win in Formula 1. It's the one. So pretty cool. In the car, no! Especially in qualifying. I don__ think I felt anything close to calm. Qualifying in Monaco is the best laps of the year. I think it's the best in Formula 1__r just motor sport in general. It__ the one that brings you the most excitement, the most fear, the most uncomfortableness (sic). And at the same time, when you cross the line, the one that brings you the biggest smile. Saturday is perfect. Sunday, not always known to be the best race of the season, but still a great race for many reasons. Nope. Not at all. Like Carlos said, there are little tweaks here and there. But no, nothing that will change how we have to do anything. Honestly, I think it's pretty obvious. I think it's fairly simple. I've made it clear on where my struggles have been. The things I__e found a little more difficult, especially this season compared to previous ones. Saturdays have had a lot more ups and downs. My Sundays_95% of the races this season____e been pretty happy with. Of course, there are still some races that haven__ gone perfectly. If I look back on Miami and things like that, if I could redo things, of course, I would do some things differently, but some things just go the way they do. My Sundays I__e been very happy with. I__ always very confident going into Sundays, and I__e been this whole season. So yeah, it__ just tweaking little things, and that__ more just the position that I start the race. That__ been the biggest thing. Like I said before, Monaco is the area I__e been working on the most. It__ the one I__ putting the most time and effort into because it__ the one that allows me to win races or not. No. It depends. Monaco__ never been a race that__ been good on Sunday. Never has. Yet it__ the race everyone wants to win. It__ the one everyone looks forward to the most every single season. It__ always been like that. Even some of the best races you__e ever seen__ero overtakes. I__ more mixed on my opinions on whether it should change that much. I don__ think you__e ever going to get it to be a great race. The good races have been the ones where it__ rained halfway through and things like that. I__ not saying it can never be, I__ just saying it never has been. Yet everyone still knows it as just the best race of the season. I think there are things that can be done, but it__ more from a car point of view. But it__ also a track. It__ a street circuit. Overtaking on most street circuits is a bit trickier unless it__ got a two-kilometre straight like Baku. Monaco doesn__ even just reach past two kilometres in length. So I__ more mixed just because I don__ think it__ ever been. I think it puts more pressure on Saturdays. Maybe you should make a more special event of a Saturday. One-lap shootouts__ more exciting Saturday. Rather than__ just don__ think you can do a lot on Sunday. The two-stop didn__ really make it that much better. In fact, it probably made more things happen from a team and strategy point of view like we saw some teams do. But every team would have thought of that. If they didn__, then they should have done. So yeah, just my opinion. I don__ think it needs to change that much. I__ pretty happy. And from George__ point, George can do what he wants. No. I think, again, it__ special just having a race on Sunday. There are still opportunities. Still things can happen__aybe not always for the win, but for second places, third places. Things can happen. For points, things can happen. Sometimes you__e got to take a bit of risk, and sometimes there__ luck involved.
But like I said, if you want to make a bigger event out of it, make it a more qualifying-based event. I don__ think you can really change the race__nless you make the cars half the size of what they are now. Just my opinion. I don__ think it needs to change that much. It__ never been anything else than what it has been now. So I think people should just be happy with what it is. I said probably in every interview I did there that it did. I was happier with my pole on Saturday than I was with my win on Sunday because everyone knows Saturday is the day you__e got to show up and do your job.
And of course, in the most tricky track of the season, under the most pressure, the most tense, the session where the most stuff can go wrong, with the biggest consequences__t was probably my best qualifying performance of the whole season. So, I definitely think it gave me a boost. But it__ not like I come into here feeling better than ever. There are still plenty of things I__ working on, things I know I need to do better on and try to improve. But that__ not just a one-week or two-week thing. It takes time, and I__ patient with that. I__ trying to work as quickly as I can. But sometimes it__ a longer and more difficult process. That__ what it is sometimes when you__e against the best guys in the world. So I don__ expect different. But yeah, a lot of good things came out of Monaco. I think you ask me this question every week. It__ the same answer. Like I say always, it__ a great feeling to be in the lead of the championship and to have more points than everyone. But again, it__ not something I look at. It__ not something that changes anything I do day to day. Doesn__ change how hard I work or what I try to achieve. I just try and win this weekend, and I__l try and win in Montreal, and I__l try and win in Austria. It__ got nothing to do with what position I am. And no, I think mathematically, there__ still probably the whole grid that can win the championship at the minute. So, if you think it__ just out of me and Oscar, then I think you__e a bit silly. I think there__ plenty of opportunities. Max can still win. I think Ferrari_ they__e Ferrari, I expect them to get better through the season. But yeah, come on. We__e racing Max every weekend. He__ been on the podium several times. He__ won races. He beat us in Imola fair and square because he was quicker. So I don__ know what possibly makes you think that it__ only between me and Oscar. Probably. Yeah. I think he did. Austin, yes.",Spain,thursday,McLaren
Oliver Bearman,"Honestly, I__ at a bit of a loss because the weekends where we expected to struggle, we__e actually done really well__nd vice versa. So, it__ tough to really build predictions for this car. What we__e done is bring the new upgrade in Imola, and we need to see how that works now in high-speed corners, because Imola isn__ as high-speed as Barcelona. If we can get that under control and have good performance there, then I think it can be another solid weekend for car performance. I agree. I mean, looking at the stats, it__ not like Monaco used to have a bunch of overtakes and now it doesn__. It__ never been a track where the race is particularly exciting. People just need to accept that the thrill of Monaco is on Saturday in qualifying. It__ always going to be a boring race with a track of that size. And unfortunately, with the cars of this size, nothing__ going to happen. I think smaller cars would be better, but I don__ think it__ going to fix everything. Because 20, 30 years ago, it was the same scenario__ot many overtakes. But quali is where the fun is in Monaco, and that__ even more reason to qualify well__hen you don__ get stuck in the train.",Spain,thursday,Haas
Fernando Alonso,"Well, home Grand Prix. So, it's different to all drivers when you race in front of your home crowd and, you know. Friends, family are normally in the grandstands or in the paddock. And, yeah, you want to deliver something always extra at your home place. And we know Barcelona very well. It's not only in my case. I think all Formula 1 drivers, we did a lot of laps here, a lot of testing. So, yeah, it's a circuit that we know very well, and we push the limits from FP1 to the race. Let's see. I think Barcelona will tell us a little bit more about the new package. Imola was a step forward for sure, but also, I think we ran the Medium tyres and that helped us in qualifying. And then Monaco is such a special place and Saturday is obviously a key part of the weekend, and we put some good laps on Saturday as well. So, Barcelona, with a more normal weekend, we will discover where we are in terms of performance. But, yeah, I think everyone will bring also some upgrades here, especially with the new regulation with the front wing, and let's see how much it affects everyone on the grid. Yeah, it was fantastic. I think the way he sees things on the car, even statically in the pit lane or at the grid, also in the garage, spotting some things that we could have done better or do better in the future. But also, yes, his presence in the meeting room is always special. And I think, not intimidating, but the level of the team was higher thanks to his presence because everyone was more focused, more into the details of the car. People that were talking in the meeting knew that they could not say anything too far from the truth because he will spot it. So, I think that was great to witness, and I hope next year with more races that he will come, we will keep learning from him and getting better as a team. I think the focus is on 2026. But in order to be confident and strong in '26, you have to build the momentum also in '25, and you have to deliver some parts on track that are making the car faster as well in '25. And that will, I think, give some confidence to the team as well, back in Silverstone and also in our tools to make sure that everything that we are developing in '26, it makes sense, because we go on track and it delivers the expectations. So, yeah, I think there is a little bit of work still on '25, but the main focus or the hopes are in '26. We understand the situation. We understand where we are in 2025, and whatever we bring to the track will just be a minimum change in terms of positions and finishing order. I think the biggest step in that regard can only happen in '26, where all the hopes are. Well, I think all the simulators will have some kind of correlation issues to the real car. And I don't think that any team has a perfect simulator that you can trust 100%, because the car on the real track and in real life is very dynamic and it keeps changing, always, corner to corner and session to session. There are not two laps on the weekend that are exactly the same, because of the wind, because of the temperature, because of the traffic in front__ll these kinds of things. So when you try to replicate that on a simulator, in a consistent and perfect environment, I think it's very different. But I think it will take less than two years to fix our simulator. It's not new. Maybe it's the first time that Adrian said it in Monaco in the interview. But rest assured that drivers, we mentioned it a couple of times already. I don't remember_ Of course. Monaco has been Monaco always. But now I think there is a lot of expectations and there is a lot of media__ou are not the one to blame__ut there is a lot of news generated every single day. And there are a lot of things on the internet, social media. There are a lot of things generated for Formula 1. So, we want to see the show. We want to see the overtaking. We want to improve the sport from our couch at home. Everyone has ideas. And, yeah, I'm always a little bit surprised about the negative comments from Monaco on Monday. But don't worry, because next year we will go to Monaco. And on Wednesday we will be so excited. Then on Friday we will say that it's the best weekend on track of the season, and we all want to win in Monaco. And then on Saturday we are all super excited, and the adrenaline that you get on those laps is probably unique in the championship. And then for whatever reason, on Sunday we will be all disappointed once again. But I think it's what it is. You play all your cards on Saturday. Sometimes it's good, sometimes not. But there are some other circuits that are also like that. And it's the nature of Formula 1, even with how competitive the field is now. A few years ago, two or three years ago, I think Max and Red Bull won nearly all the races. And it happened also with McLaren back in the nineties. And this is Formula 1. It has happened and it will happen also in the future. But it's still the number one sport and we still embrace how it is. Well, I don__ think that we will lose Barcelona. So that__ my opinion and my wish as well. I think it's good to have new venues. It__ good to have new countries as well that Formula 1 has moved to in the last decade. But at the same time, we need to keep some traditional circuits where the history of Formula 1 has been written and made. And I think Formula 1 and Barcelona are very linked. We've been testing here for decades. I think all the teams choose Barcelona when they have to choose one test track. We come back next year here in winter because we have new regulations, new cars, and again, once again, the teams chose Barcelona because it's the Formula 1 track in a way. And I think the circuit has made some changes to make it up to Formula 1 standards. So in the last two or three years, all the paddock facilities, the grandstands, everything has taken a new level. And Barcelona has been here for the last two or three decades, and Barcelona will be here for the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years. And some of the venues will be just momentarily on the calendar and then probably they will disappear again. So, we cannot lose Barcelona. Yeah. I mean, great for Spain, first of all. Great for him to have the Indy 500 now after winning the series and the IndyCar for a few consecutive seasons and now leading the championship as well. So, he__ doing great there. I know that most of the drivers dream about a Formula 1 seat and having a career here. But he had the opportunity in IndyCar and he maximised every single day there. He's a legend in IndyCar and he will be a legend always in IndyCar. So I think he's not missing Formula 1, and I'm very happy for him because he's a very, very talented driver. And yeah, we are just following him from here with a lot of respect and as a fan, because I was watching on Sunday the race and just hoping that he would finally make it__nd he did it. So, happy for him. I never overtook any car! Well, also, yeah, also Lance overtook Nico in the last lap. You know? You see one overtake every ten years. So great, you know? I mean, this has been the Monaco nature. I think Max spoke about this because you asked Max about Monaco, because the last thing that Max has in his head now is just the Monaco race. But there is this constant talk about how bad is something instead of how good is something. And this is Monaco. And I don__ think_ You know, maybe there are a couple of ideas that, between all involving the sport, drivers, FIA, teams, we can think about Monaco, but I don__ think that there is any need to think something. It__ only because, as I said, there is a lot of content now to be created, and drivers, we are too nice. So, we answer to every question. Because if 40 years ago, you ask, I__ sure, Senna and Prost, and they are fighting for the championship or whatever__bout Monaco after one week, they would be less polite than we are now. Enough to fit Yuki and myself. And after that, it__ George__ problem. That__ out of the__ mean, there are other sports like basketball and other things that you can try. But no, I mean, I always said that the early 2000s, for me, were the best cars that I drove. But maybe you__e a little bit romantic about this answer because it was my first days in Formula 1, and success came also in those years. But I think the V10 engines, the small cars__ have great, great memories from that time. And the cars were nice to drive and fun to drive. But still__o overtaking in Monaco. It will be a very important one, yes. Not the final one. I think I need to see how next year starts and how motivated I am. Every year, there is a different mood into the season. There is a different feeling on how you perform, how competitive you feel yourself, how motivated you are to keep your fitness at the high level__ersonal situation, family situation__ll these things play a role in some important decisions in life. I know that a very important decision in life will come for me in the near future when I stop racing. I did my first race in go-kart at the age of three. I__ 43. So, for 40 years, I have had a steering wheel in my hands, and I know that one day I will have to stop. And that__ an important decision that I will think carefully. I did stop Formula 1 already once in 2018, and I came back because I needed it. So, the next one that I take, it has to be 100% sure. From what I know, it was something on the spark plug and then it damaged one cylinder. And then after that cylinder was damaged, I was racing with five cylinders for 20 laps. And then the engine stopped completely, and that engine cannot be used again. It__ gone. So, yeah, that__ the news that I have. I don__ think there was anything really wrong with it or any procedure that was different than any other race. It was just the end of the life of that engine. It happened at the wrong moment at the wrong time. But yeah, nothing probably we could have done differently. And for this race, there is nothing really different to be made, and we should be okay, because we never had that problem and we don__ think that that problem will be repeated. Yes. Yes. I think Formula 1 is in a great moment now, and we are all enjoying the new fans, the new boom in Formula 1. But, yeah, at the same time, you need to feel it when it__ time. And I don__ feel it yet. I jump in the car tomorrow and on Sunday, and I__ on the grid__nd I__ just so happy to be there and motivated and performing well. Because I think at the end of the day, the stopwatch will tell me also when I have to stop. Or I have a physical condition that is bad, or I have pain driving or whatever, that could happen as well. Sometimes you get a little bit injured, you get some bad races. But if we keep it healthy and in good conditions, the stopwatch also will tell me one day that I don__ feel fast enough or I don__ feel that I can put the lap together. But so far, I__ happy with that. I__ happy when I__ on the grid. When I finish the race on Sunday, even if the results are not nice at the moment, I__ so motivated to go to the next race and try to overcome the bad race and have a better one. So all these kind of things are very alive now, but there is no guarantee that this will be forever.",Spain,thursday,Aston Martin
George Russell,"I mean, ultimately, our weekend was over from Saturday. We know Monaco is a qualifying race, and I think there were hopes or expectations that with the two-stop, things would be spiced up a little bit. And I think we__e all grateful for the trial of the two-stop, but clearly, it didn__ change things as people predicted. And it was a real shame because we__ lost our way slightly during the weekend in Monaco, but we went back to a known set-up in Q1 and we were right back in the groove, right back inside the top four, which is where we__e been always on Saturday afternoons this year. So that was a real shame. Yeah. It__ obviously been two poor races. We__e been inside the top five every single session up until Imola. So we__e hoping to get back into our usual form and have a clean weekend. As Fernando said, with the changes to the front wings that have been made, there__ a bit of relearning all of the teams will have to take, but I don__ expect it to shake the order up too much. Yeah, I don__ see any reason why not. As I said, up until Imola, we__e been inside the top five every single quali and race. And, of course, Imola was a bad race, and then in Monaco things were slightly outside of our control. So I don__ see any reason why we wouldn__ be back in that fight for the top five, hopefully fighting for the podium. But we do know our race pace, especially in hot races, is a step behind McLaren, and this weekend is going to be very hot. The track is going to be over 50 degrees for the majority of the weekend. The only difference being here is we__e on the hardest compound of tyres, whereas in Imola and in Jeddah, where we struggled the most this season, it was on the softest compound of tyres. So that__ one more change. I was just getting tired of staring at the back of a Williams rear wing for 50 laps, to be honest. I mean, it was a bit ironic because I finished higher up the order by doing that move than I would have done if I just stuck behind Alex. I pulled a whole pit stop in the space of three laps, and then I was free to do my own race. But for us, the weekend was gone so early. We weren't fighting for anything. You get the same points for P11 as you do for P20. And as I said, I just wanted to enjoy Monaco. I didn't get the chance on Saturday. Like Fernando said, it's the most adrenaline you get in a whole season, and I didn't have that chance because of what happened. I at least enjoyed the last 25 laps of the race. So, it's not part of the new George Russell being a rebel, cutting the track, it was just getting tired of seeing Alex driving like a grandma. Not expensive enough! So, the bill is definitely not even just yet. As I said, I knew I was going get a penalty, and I said I was happy to take the penalty. And it was a deserved penalty. I think that should never be allowed. And as I said, if I was in the points and if I was racing Alex, I would never have done that. He had already done two pit stops. I hadn__ even done one single pit stop. He was only driving so slow to benefit his team-mate. It wasn__ to benefit him against me, it was to benefit him against the drivers around him. So, as I said, I wasn__ doing it for a sporting gain. I was just doing it for my own enjoyment because it was a bit rubbish. But the penalty I received, on any other circuit, in any other circumstance, was more than fair. Yeah. I think like Fernando said, Monaco has always been the same. I__e seen some of the proposed track changes that definitely will not make it worse, because_ The small problem you have in Monaco is the one overtaking opportunity, which is out of the tunnel. The natural racing line is__ou're going from a left, braking through the middle of the track and then you pull over to the right. So, it's very easy for a driver to position his car. But honestly, right now, I don't have the answer. Maybe the manual override would be a solution and, you know, you__e got to do all of this management through the race. And if you've got a lot more power just to pass somebody in an unconventional space, it isn__ going to make the show worse. But part of me just thinks we need to accept Monaco for what it is. Formula 1 is better by having Monaco on the calendar. It is the most exhilarating qualifying of the season. And the race is always pretty boring, but it also makes us appreciate the other races as well. So I don__ know, to be honest. Sorry for the long one.",Spain,thursday,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah. I__ still building the progress in terms of confidence and everything. I mean, understanding about the car is getting there. Just, you know, the last few tenths, few milliseconds, especially when you want the track evolution, you want to naturally feel it, right? And those things__hen you sometimes change set-up, you want to know what kind of balance you__e going to get. And obviously, with a new car, it__ just hard to know exactly how the car is going to behave. In those things it comes down to experience. And obviously, last four years with VCARB, I knew exactly what__ going to happen, so I didn__ really have to even think about those things. I would naturally react and drive fast. So I think those things will come. I think the Imola thing just made me re-recognise (sic) the amount of understanding I currently have. I was probably slightly underestimating how important it is to know those areas especially. So it__ not that I__e lost confidence or whatever, but just slowly building up and we__l be there at some point. I mean, to be honest, Monaco was pretty good until qualifying. Yeah, red flag and lots of things didn__ go to plan. Obviously, it__ always hard to be on the plan and there was definitely a lap that I could have done slightly better. So in that sense, yeah, qualifying was very tough for us, tough for me especially. But at least until FP2, FP3, I was fighting quite close, and to be honest, the pace was probably best ever. So, it__ getting there. And Barcelona _ yeah, I mean, I didn__ see much history about the Red Bull winning here, but you said four times he__ won, that__ good news. But I just keep focusing on myself rather than Max.",Spain,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. Obviously, the win would have been better, but it's been a bit of a tricky weekend. Practice was messy all the way through, and I felt like I got into qualifying with not a lot of confidence with how the weekend was going. I got close, but not quite close enough. And, you know, around here, where you qualify is pretty much where you're going to finish. So, pretty happy with that overall. Obviously, some things to look out for when we come back next year, but some more points on the board, another trip to the podium in Monaco, so not all bad. Yeah, exactly. The margins are so fine and, like you said, if this is a bad weekend, then it's not going too badly at all. So, yeah, some things to work on. We'll go again next week and try and come back stronger. But well done to Lando. He's had a great weekend. Well done to Charles as well. He's been quick as usual. So, yeah, happy, and see you on the podium. Thank you. Cheers. Yep. Pretty much exactly how I expected. I think there was a lot of action behind, so maybe that was a bit different. But from where I was at, it panned out pretty much how I thought. It definitely made the pace of the race a bit higher, certainly compared to last year. So from the cockpit, it was a little bit more intense. We__e still not pushing flat out, but it just made certain points of the race a bit more tense. Everything felt okay, but you're not really pushing it to the limit in the race. I was pretty happy with it in qualifying. I think we got there eventually. It was more just struggling to get into a rhythm before qualifying. And around here, you pay the price for not having that clean run into quali. So that__ where I think our weekend got away from us a little bit. But the pace was still good, just trying to get everything out of it. Every single lap was tough yesterday. And today, we tried a few things to get higher than third, but it didn__ work. It definitely made it a bit more tense at a few points. You had to push more at certain points to kind of recover the safety car windows to other cars around you or put yourself outside of someone else's safety car window. So there were some strategic elements involved. But ultimately, at the front, I don__ think it changed a whole lot. It would have been quite a different story if there was a red flag with five laps to go and Max would have won. I__ sure if we keep this going in the future, eventually a result like that will happen. Is that what we want to see? I don't know. But at the front, I don't think it changed a huge amount this weekend. No. I don__ think so. We were too far back. I think we tried to make something happen, but I don__ think it was ever going to change our result.",Monaco,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Not really. But at the end of the day, we lost the race yesterday and we should have done a better job. Lando did a better job this weekend and he deserves the win. On my side, yeah, I realised a childhood dream last year. Not this year, but considering everything, I think it's a lot above our expectations coming here. I thought that being in the top 10 would be a challenge. At the end, we are second, very close to P1. So, it's been a good weekend overall. But, yeah, I wish I won. Oh, it was good as well from inside the car because before that, it was a little bit boring. I had to leave a gap to Lando because otherwise I would overheat everything, so I couldn't be so close. Then when I saw Max was playing the long game, I guess he was waiting for a red flag. That helped me a little bit to put a bit more pressure on Lando, but it wasn't enough. Yeah. As I always say, as a Ferrari driver, we are very lucky. We get support everywhere. But being born here and seeing all the Monegasques behind me is something very special. We are not many Monegasques, but it warms my heart very much to be at home and to have so much support. So, yeah, I wish I had given them the first place, but hopefully next year. I don't know. I'm never really happy with second place. Then if you do a step back and you look at our season, I think this is a very positive result for the whole team. Especially coming here, we had very low expectations, just because our low-speed performance has been very bad all season. However, I think here, it's a very specific track because there are a lot of bumps, a lot of kerb riding, and I think our car is pretty good on that. That helped us to close the gap. So, yeah, I think we did a really good job, and 18 points plus the 10 of Lewis are very valuable points for the situation we are in. On that, I think we should be proud. Am I over the moon for a second place? Not really, but it's been a very positive weekend anyway. It's very difficult. When Max at the end was in front, I really believed in it until the very end. I thought about it all night, the two or three places where I could try something on Lando, and I was willing to take all the risks possible to try and get that win. But, unfortunately, these opportunities never came. Or at least I had maybe two or three laps where I was like, __K, maybe I go for it,_ but Lando straight away saw those and defended very well. So I basically couldn't really go and try something. At the end, there were no opportunities for me. I think there were maybe two laps in Rascasse, which was the place where I was trying, and maybe one in Fairmont. But the Fairmont one was very optimistic, maybe. I think being second today, I was pretty happy that this was the case because it at least gives you a little bit more hope that something is possible. Honestly, it was quite interesting because with the traffic and everything, there was lots of things happening, or at least you had to push through traffic, which is a very tricky thing to do, especially here in Monaco. So I think it gives more opportunities. I__e heard also there were quite a lot of team games behind us. Whether this is the kind of action we want to see going ahead, I don__ know. I haven__ looked at the race yet. But, yeah, it__ always been a bit like that in Monaco. It's special for that, especially on the Saturday when you're pushing to the limit. That__ why it__ so important and tense for drivers to go into qualifying in Monaco because we know that then on Sunday you don__ have as many opportunities. That is part of the magic of Monaco. Then I understand we need to try and find a way to make it a bit more exciting, and maybe that__ the way to go. But I haven__ checked the race to really judge. Oh, that__ a very difficult question to answer because honestly, I don__ even know how much smaller they will be. I think Monaco is always going to be tricky, and I think you just adapt the way you defend to the width of the car you have behind. So, yeah, I don__ have the answer, but I hope that next year overtaking will be a little bit easier here in Monaco. By far, the slow-speed corners. I think this is our biggest weakness by far. That__ why also I came here very pessimistic and saying that I thought top 10 would already be a challenge. Our low-speed performance is very poor. I think on a track like this, with so many bumps and kerbs, our car is actually performing very well. This is helping us, but unfortunately, it__ only going to help us on such an extreme track like here. So yeah, we__e got to work on our low-speed performance. I think as we said, it just adds a lot of randomness. You can either get lucky or very unlucky, and it__ a bit out of your hands. But it__ always been a little bit the case in Monaco, probably even more so now with two stops. But there was not any more tension on my side. When is it starting exactly? OK. I won__ be on my couch. Thanks for the invite. I think I__l still be in a meeting. We are very late with Ferrari. We always leave late. But yeah, it__ a crazy race. We were just speaking with Oscar before. I don__ think I will ever do it. I think it__ a different level of craziness. I__ happy in F1, I love F1, and I__ fully focused on that, first and foremost. And then when this will end, another thing I want to tick, is doing Le Mans with my brother. So, these are probably the two things I really want to do. Indy 500 _ I__ not sure. But I have a lot of respect for these guys, and I__l try to follow as much as I can tonight.",Monaco,post-race,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"It feels amazing. It's a long race. It's a long, rolling race. But good fun. You know, we could push for quite a lot of the race. The last quarter was a little bit nervous, with Charles close behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco. So, it doesn't matter how you win, I guess. But an amazing weekend with pole, with today _ this is what I dream of. This is what I did dream of when I was a kid. So, I achieved one of my dreams. I think it was you _ I saw you in front of my car before the start, and I was like, __f JB is here now, then I'll always take that. It's my good luck charm_. Oh is it yours? I apologise! It is. I mean, the worst bit, really, was just the end. I felt quite under control the whole race. But Max was ahead, and Max was kind of backing it up a little bit. And I knew then that's when Charles had the opportunity. So, I had to manage it quite a lot. I tried to back off of Max, so I could push when I needed to and chill when I needed to. I still had to manage. It was still a well-fought race. But I'm very happy. My team are very happy. And therefore, we're going to have a wonderful night. Well, all I saw was camera lenses. So, I can dream of better, but it was_ I mean, it__ the feelings. Of course, the view of the team and seeing everyone, my mum and dad down below_ Yeah, it__ the feelings inside, which are really the special ones. Seeing the chequered flag and, yeah, winning in Monaco is something I dreamed of when I was a kid. There are many things that I think everyone dreams of _ it__ getting to Formula 1, winning a race in Formula 1, and winning a race in Monaco. And we achieved it today. So yeah, proud of the whole team, of myself, and big accomplishment for all of us. The team haven't won since, what, 2008 or something. So not just a good one for me, but a good one for McLaren too. No dramas. I think there were definitely some more tense moments in the race when I needed to push, and Charles was never that far behind. Especially at the end with Max ahead, there were some tense moments trying not to get too close to Max, otherwise that__ when Charles had opportunities. But I think we managed it well with the strategy. It__ always hard to know what we could have done better. I'm sure we can review things and look back on it. But in the end, the result was the perfect one. Tricky at times, with the amount of cars, there were big bunches of cars, so getting through them without making mistakes, without any silly things happening was always the most nerve-wracking bit. Otherwise, I felt good. I felt good with the tyres, with the management of tyres and stints and all of those things. So, yeah, I was happy. I think yesterday gave me confidence. Today_ Yeah, nothing new in the sense of I__e had confidence in every Sunday we've had this year. I've not needed the confidence on Sundays, but yesterday was a bigger day for me. I was more proud of yesterday than I almost was of today. Not just because a pole in Monaco sets up a win, but the accomplishment of doing it, no matter what the track would have been, was something I'm more proud about. So yeah, a good weekend for me, not just in terms of result but personally, to kind of give myself that momentum, that boost, definitely makes me feel better going into Barcelona next week. Hated it. Because it made it a lot more scary for me. I wish it was a one-stop, it would have been a lot more chilled. It__ not for me. The rules are not made for me. They're not made for us to enjoy it more or whatever. They're made for the fans. They__e made to provide more entertainment for the viewers. I don__ know if that was the case. So maybe it's a question I should ask you. Was the two-stop better than the one-stop? Oh, we__e playing Uno! Depends where I start. Yeah. What can I do? Nothing. It__ out of my control. No real point thinking about it. If it happened, it happened. He wins Monaco, well done. Yeah. I was happy. I__ just focusing on my own race. Of course, praying that it didn__ happen, but I didn__ think of the rest. Yeah. I mean, people can write what they want. It__ not up to me. People have their own opinions, they can do all of those things. Thing is, none of them are true, 99% of the time. So, it__ all crap. I don__ mind what people write as long as I know the truth and my team know the truth, and that__ fine. I__e been working hard over the last few months to get back to having that momentum that I had in Australia, that confidence. What I felt this weekend was a small step forward, but it__ not it. It__ not like I__e nailed it now and everything__ back. There are still things that I need to work on, there are still things that _ as a team _ them giving me the equipment _ and I don__ mean just making a quicker car, because the car__ quick enough _ but giving me the things I need from the car in order to excel and maximise results, and the differences from last year to this year. So, still things from both sides, but I__ very proud of yesterday. I__ happier with yesterday__ result than I am of today__. I mean, today is incredible, but I was more emotional yesterday than I was today. That__ how much yesterday meant to me, to kind of get my groove back in qualifying, because it__ something I__e just had my whole life. It__ just always been good, until this year. And I__e had to work hard to try and get it back. For no other reason apart from a couple of things that I__e clearly struggled with and also just having tough competition. Having Oscar, Charles, Max, I__ against the best guys in the world. And if you__e not performing at the highest level, you__e not going to compete against them. So, yeah, no one knows the amount of work and effort that goes into things apart from me and my team. And that__ the only people who need to know what goes into everything and know the truth of everything. And that__ the way it will stay. Well, I think the best bit is that my kids one day will be able to tell everyone that I won in Monaco. That__ probably the thing I__ most proud about. I think it would be up there for sure, especially because of the weekend that it__ been _ with pole and with the race. It wasn__ just a pole or just the race. It was both together, and I think that__ perfect. Regardless, I think that__ something to be very proud about for the rest of my life. But I think it__ a cooler thing to say, also from my lap time yesterday _ the 1:09 _ that__ very unlikely to be beaten for a very long time unless the track changes or whatever. The cars next year are nowhere near going to be as quick as this year. Hopefully, that lap time lasts for a very, very long time. So, it__ cool. It__ definitely just the saying more than anything, but also the meaning, the history, the people that have won here in the past. They don__ always go on to be champions, but most of them have. And just to know in 30 years_ time, I can say, __ mastered Monaco that one year_ _ or hopefully a few more _ but that one year is something I look forward to saying. I don__ know. Ask the people who make the rules. We just have to abide by them, but it depends what you want. Do you want to manufacture races? There hasn__ been any more overtaking here. I thought that was what was wanted. Now you just give people opportunity by luck _ by waiting for a red flag, waiting for a Safety Car. You__e not getting a more deserved winner in the end of things, which I don__ entirely agree with. I think it should be the person who drives the best race and deserves to win. Of course, I__ probably slightly biased in my opinion, but I think it needs to be improved in different ways _ like, overtaking has never been good in Monaco, ever. So, I don__ know why people have such a high expectation. But I also think Formula 1 should not turn into just a show to entertain people. It__ a sport. It__ who can race the best, who can qualify the best. Like Charles said, everything was about yesterday. That__ the way it__ been since whatever the first year _ 50, 60 years ago. So, the last thing I want is manufactured racing, and I think we definitely need to stay away from that and do a better job with cars, with tyres. Then you might start to see more racing, but not by just introducing so many pit stops. Did you ask Max? What did he say? I have no idea. So that__ all I__l say. I will probably be watching on my couch at home, unless I get an invite. Or, yeah, I mean, you__e welcome to come, if you want. But, yeah, probably on my couch. And I__l keep my answer short because I want to go watch it. About one hour. One and a half hours. Ditto. I would love to do Le Mans with my brother, but he__ been out of it for a little bit. I just have a lot of respect for these guys. I mean, congrats to Robert Shwartzman for pole _ it was pretty impressive. I was his team-mate back in 2015 or 2016 in Formula Renault. So to see him go on to do something like that is pretty cool. But it is something I__l never do. I can say it right now. I__ not doing it. Just have no interest in doing it. Not my thing. It__ not what I enjoy. Even though I__e done it on the sim and that was quite fun _ but I got taken out. So, well, it didn__ hurt. I could just press escape and I was good. I have a lot of respect for these guys. There are a lot of incredibly talented drivers over there in America, and some of them could do very well in Formula 1. But, yeah, I like turning right as well. So, that__ the main thing. Nope.",Monaco,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Intense as it always is around here. Quite reminiscent of last year, to be honest. My first lap felt good, and then the second lap, a mistake in the Harbour chicane, and yeah, left a little bit on there. I think to beat Lando today was going to be tough. So well done to him. But no, still pretty happy with it. It's been a pretty messy weekend so far, so to come out with a lap that I thought was pretty good and third is a decent result. Yeah, exactly. I mean, I think I've hit more walls this weekend than I have in my whole career, so it's been untidy. But yeah, just been struggling to get into the groove a bit. I think in qualifying I was much happier with things, and I felt pretty good. But yeah, we've been doing some digging this weekend, and to come out with this result is a decent effort. We have thought about it, but a lot depends on where you qualify. So, we're in good positions, obviously. But yeah, it's still gonna be an exciting race tomorrow with the two stops. So, let's see what happens. Thank you. I think so, yes. It__ been a pretty challenging time until Q3, to be honest. But I feel like we got the car in a much better window for qualifying and I was much happier. But it__ just been a very messy weekend. I said before, I think I__e hit more things this weekend than I have in my whole career. So, it__ not been that straightforward, but I think to come out with this result is quite positive. The laps I did at the end of qualifying felt pretty good. Obviously not quite enough, but yeah. I think at a track like this when you__e had a messy build-up, you__e always going to leave a little bit on the table. Just struggling with the balance really. Struggling with confidence in the car, I think. It__ in a much better place now than it was yesterday for sure, so I don__ think that was necessarily the problem at this point. But yeah, I__e just been struggling to repeat the feeling I had last year through practice really. But I think the team did a good job of trying to put the car in a better window, and I think we definitely did that by qualifying. But, yeah, definitely some laps I would rather have done again through the weekend. I don__ think anyone really knows what to expect. So probably, yes. I think just gaining confidence in the car from yesterday has been a good step forward today. I think naturally when the grip comes up, you take more fuel out, you enter qualifying, everything starts to naturally feel a little bit better as well. The team did a good job. We certainly didn__ go into qualifying with a lack of trying. So, yeah, I think we did a good job of trying to get in a better window. How much are you going to pay me? I mean, I want to win the race too. So let__ see what happens. I think it__ going to be a pretty chaotic race, but we__l see what happens. I think it__l be just as important. It__ just that instead of kind of having one pit stop where you need to manipulate things around, there__ two. And you have to use three sets of tyres. I mean, the cars aren__ smaller, so the overtaking is still not going to be very high, I don__ think. But there will be a lot more uncertainty with strategy.",Monaco,post-qualifying,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"Well, there's always something more to be done. No, I mean, at the end of the day, this was the best we could do. I think the lap was really good. The first lap was a little bit of a shame because that gives you a bit more confidence for the second run when you have a first good lap. I couldn't have that. I had to deal with traffic, but it's the way it is. Just obviously very frustrated. We know that we don't quite have the car to go for wins this year, but this weekend the car felt good. And starting second here is going to be tricky to then take that first place. Yeah. I don't know. I like city tracks in general. I like to really go all in into qualifying and take maximum risks, and I think this, most of the time, pays off. Sometimes it doesn't pay off, but yeah, I'm proud anyway of the result we've had today, as on paper it was going to be a very difficult weekend for us. At the end of the day, it's not that bad. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, it was a good lap, but it was a bit of a tricky Q3. In the first run of Q3, I had Max in the second sector and lost a lot of lap time there. So, obviously, when you don__ have that first time in Q3, then you have a little bit less confidence to go flat out on the second run. I don__ think this made the difference at the end of the day. I haven__ seen exactly the gaps, but I think it__ bigger than a few hundredths. So, yeah, it is the way it is. I__ obviously disappointed__eing at home and being on top of every free practice session was a good sign. But I kind of felt it already in FP3 where I knew that I was putting laps very much on the limit. And when you look at the onboard, you can see drivers that are taking a bit of a step back. So I knew it would be close, but at the end of the day, I didn__ get it this year. No. I__ not satisfied, because you forget very quickly with the expectations that you have going into a weekend when free practices are going so well. I think we were wrong with the expectations that we had. And at the end of the day, it was a lot more positive than what we initially thought. We still need to understand why, to be completely honest. For me, it__ an unknown. I don__ quite know why we are so fast in slow speed suddenly, but we__l analyse that after the weekend. But no, disappointment is big. I think it__ going to be a bit of chaos tomorrow, but we__l see how it plays out. I think there__l be a lot of strategy games, and we__l see who comes out on top. But I think we might be under pressure from cars that we probably don__ expect, from the back, which might make everything interesting. We__l see. I mean, we__l never know. I don__ know. I don__ know if Oscar improved as well on the second timed lap. But anyway, again, the gap was a bit more than a few hundredths. It was just over a tenth. You can__ point the finger on many things because it's not a huge gap either. So yeah, I honestly don__ know. I thought the tyres felt pretty good on that first timed lap. But then when you do that one lap, then you push a little bit more on the second one, and you see that the limit is a little bit further away. But the actual answer is that I don__ know. I think the only explanation I can find for now is that on a track like this, where there__ only low speed _ basically no high-speed corners _ in most of the tracks, we had to take compromises in order to not lose too much in high-speed corners. We don__ have to set up the car in a way where we compromise anything here because we just focus on the low speed. And when we are on these kinds of tracks, it seems that there__ some performance in the low speed from the car. But we are a little bit stuck at the moment on other tracks, so I don__ think we can apply it to any other tracks other than Monaco, unfortunately. Yeah, as I was saying earlier, I think it__ very difficult also to know what to expect. I think we all go a little bit into the unknown. More stops means more opportunities. I don__ think it will change what happens in Turn 1, Lap 1. I think that__ going to be very similar to any other year because it__ going to be just as significant. But then we__l have to see with the pit stops. I don__ think there__ going to be anything surprising in the top positions. I think there__ going to be some things that are probably going to be surprising in the back, and that could affect the top positions. So yeah, I don__ know. It__ going to be interesting. We__l see. No, we did not. We expected to struggle a lot, which wasn__ the case because from FP1, it felt really, really good. The car felt good. I felt confident with the car straight away, and we__e got to understand that_ How we can reproduce that on all the tracks. Like if we take Miami, which was two race weekends ago, we were losing so much in the low-speed corners, and now we are very fast this weekend. So, obviously, there are other things that are also changing. The ride is not great here, and we know we__e got a pretty good car in terms of ride. But I feel like there might be something else to be understood. Let__ go, baby_ That gives me a lot of confidence now. I don__ know. I mean, it was quite a few years ago. I think probably driving was _ I mean, overtaking was probably a little bit easier than today. I don__ really believe that even if starting positions are the same, that things just happen again. So, yeah, let__ say it__ not adding a lot of confidence to me. But it__ OK. We__l approach tomorrow and try to do the best job we can, and then we__l see where we end up. As I said, it__ a much more positive weekend than what we initially thought. And it__ important, even though we are disappointed today, that we take the maximum points available tomorrow without trying the miracle, to try everything for the win. We also need to be realistic. We are in a difficult situation now and every point counts. So we__l try to do the maximum to get it. If it__ not possible, it__ not possible.",Monaco,post-qualifying,Ferrari
Lando Norris,"Taken away? What? Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's been a long time coming, you know. So, I feel good. I don't think you realise how good this feels, you know, for quite a few struggles over the last couple months. Especially here in Monaco, it's a beautiful place. The hardest track probably to do it, up against the hometown hero as well. So, I'm very proud of the whole team. We've worked a lot this week__ell, actually over the last few months__o get to a day like today. So, very pleased. No risk from our side. It's what we believed was best before quali, and it's what was proven to be best after. So no, we stuck to what we believed in. Like I said, the team have done an amazing job. So thanks to everyone here, everyone back in the factory, because these days don't come easy. And of course, proud to give something back to them. That's the tricky part, you know. Trying to consistently find lap time because it's what the others are going be doing, improving more and more, and you__e got to take a similar amount of risk. But I mean, when you get to Q3, the final lap is just about who can__n a sense__ho can risk a little bit more and who can commit a little bit more. But it was a nice lap. It was a well put together lap, and it feels very good when you cross the line, and you know it's all paid off, so I'm very happy. Honestly, I have absolutely no idea. And at the minute, I don't care. I'm going to enjoy today. I've worked hard for today. Yeah, that's what tonight's for__o prepare for tomorrow. But I'm just very pleased with today. I'm happy with quali. I'm going to live the moment for a little bit and then I'll focus on tomorrow. Means a lot. Not just because it's been a while since I've been here, but just because of how things have been, how things have gone over the last couple of months, in qualifying. So, to come here with a fresh mindset and plenty more opportunities _ and in Monaco, you know, it's just a cooler, more special place to do it. A harder place, because it's more difficult as a lap, more exciting, more pressure, but the most relief at the same time when you do a good job. And today was that day. So, it means a lot to me, to my whole team, because we've been working a lot for another moment like this. A reasonable amount. I mean, never going to be full of it when you know Charles has been quickest in every session, but I think we were always there or thereabouts. I always knew that I could push a little bit more in a few places and gain some lap time, but I definitely think going into qualifying, I started to just unlock more and more, and I was gaining more confidence through quali. And that's exactly what you want around here _ improved confidence through the session. Especially in Q3, when I've just done two strong laps. Obviously, a good banker, which just gives you that reassurance that you can then go a little bit more the next time around. But it's not just these two _ it's Charles, Oscar, Max has been fast, Lewis has been quick. So, yeah, it's a good grid. It's a good competition from everyone, so it always makes it a little bit better. I don't really know, to be honest. I mean, you always want laps. We knew that it was hard to get a lap time out on the first attempt. In pretty much every session, people were improving and improving. So, we knew it would change into qualifying, but I think we stuck to our plan, which was to do one lap, then box and do another two. It's what we thought was right and clearly what was right. So, happy with what we chose to do. I have no idea. Four? It's impossible to put a number on it, especially here and more so probably in the past than going into a new-rule race tomorrow. I would have felt like a higher number if it was last year's rules, but obviously this year, things have changed. Again, my only focus until this point has been qualifying. So, I__e not thought about the race. I don__ need to until later with the team. For now, I'm enjoying the moment of the laps that I did. There's probably a small mix of both of these. Things from the car, just it being Monaco and a very different layout, a very different kind of style of driving that's needed here. It's a lot more risk, commitment, rather than just absolute car balance, in a way. And also, things that I've been working on to improve, to do a better job. Again, never because I've not had the pace__ust more that I__e never put it together come Q3. Today was probably the first time since Australia that I__e really put it all together. So it's not like I'm driving quicker, it's I__ driving in a better way, in a smarter way. But there's been a lot of work that__ gone on. So even if I was pole at any other track, I think it probably would have been the pole that__ meant the most to me. It probably means even more that it's in Monaco, but more because of what's happened over the last couple of months. May not seem like a lot, but for me, it__ quite a big thing. So, yep. Like I said, a very, very good moment. Can you repeat the question, please? Sure. I think to classify it as a breakthrough, you also need consistency of results. So I can look at it both ways. I can see, easily, the positive _ it__ a breakthrough in that I had a good Saturday. And for me, that__ at least a step in the right direction, which I__ very, very happy about. But it's still one weekend. And like I said, consistency is a big part of it too. I__l be happier if I know and I can get to that point where I__ confident into every session that I can perform like I did today because I think my performance was at a very, very strong level. So if we go into Barcelona, Canada, and the next few tracks and I can consistently perform at this level, then that__ our goal. That__ my goal _ I say __ur goal_ because it's me and my team. But certainly, today was a step in the right direction. And whether that__ a small step or a big step, it__ a step. And that's all I need for now. I mean, every weekend is a fresh mindset. It__ a new weekend, a new opportunity to learn things, to try things, to practise _ whatever it is. So, I think every weekend at the minute, I__ doing better at that: knowing there__ a new day, full of opportunities. That__ the main thing. I came in, and I__e been working very hard with my team away from the track, and here at the track, to work on as many areas as possible. I know that sometimes I always want immediate results, as I__ sure a lot of people do. But sometimes it takes time, and it has taken time. So to know that some of those things have paid off and it__ heading in the right direction, like I said, is very good to know. A lot of work from a lot of people around me, so I have to thank them as well. No. I don__ think I__e ever doubted what I can do. Of course, I__e got frustrated. I__e been unhappy because that__ normal. If you don__ win, if you don__ get pole, you__e not going to be happy, especially when it's where you should be. It__ what the objective is. So, of course, I__e had those moments. But I__e still never, certainly not this year, doubted what I__ capable of doing. And having a day like today certainly backs all of that up. So I__ happy with that. From when? Since yesterday? Oh, I don__ know. Little bits. You rarely make changes that are going to be tenths of a second or quarter of a second. You move things in a direction slowly. You make small steps with maybe several different things. But clearly, just the track improves a lot from yesterday. The lap times you're doing today__he grip is getting higher and higher. Even through qualifying, the grip gets higher and higher. So, no matter what you have in FP3 compared to FP2, what you have then in qualifying is different again. So, it's a lot of just adapting to whatever situation _ the weather, the temperature, the grip. But there's always things that we__e balancing on the car, to try and improve. I feel like we made some good steps, but it__ hard to know how much of that you can put down to the performance today. But it's clear we've been quick all weekend. The team have done an amazing job to perform again on a track that in the past has not been great for us. But over the last year and this year, it's nice to see that we can be the best. Charles just told me he would help Lewis get the win. Sadly, I think there__l be more opportunity for everyone. But that__ the way it is. That__ what Formula 1 has done to just try and put on more of a show. Of course, in my position now, I probably don__ agree with what__ been done. But I__ not the one who makes the rules. So, we__l see. I think there is more opportunity for everyone, whether you are starting on pole or if you__e starting last, you can be more optimistic, which is great for you guys. Not so good for me. So, let's wait and see. I mean, impossible to say how much. But I enjoy_ I still have my accounts, I still have social media, still do posts and that stuff. I still have it to text my friends and keep in contact with people, and that__ it. I__ very, very happy because I feel like it__ a waste of my life. I have better things to focus on. I have had many things to focus on and try to improve on. There__ many, many factors that add up to a day like today. I can certainly say that__ one of them. So, I__ happy. Everyone can do their own thing, but for me, I__ happy to stay away from that.",Monaco,post-qualifying,McLaren
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah. Honestly, it was really cool to be able to watch the movie for the first time. I think it looked great. I think for Formula 1, for the sport, it__ an amazing opportunity to dive into our world. And yeah, it's a Hollywood movie, but personally, I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt, and he makes us all look very good as Formula 1 drivers. The production did a fantastic job. I don't want to give too much away, but I definitely hope that people from the outside are going to enjoy it. Yeah, we talked right after the race, and then coming here after reviewing some of the videos, we talked again. So, it__ all clear. We had a good fight already the lap before, Turn 7. Charles put his nose in there and we had a small touch. Then all the way up to Turn 8 we were side by side. I tried to fight the position, giving some space. Ultimately, I thought I could make the corner and the grip was lower than I thought. It was all talked about. As friendly as we are off the track, when we get to the track we__l obviously fight each other as hard as we can. Yeah. Well, I think as Charles touched on, Monaco is one of those tracks where it's difficult to predict or have a clear idea of where performance is going to be. It__ one of those tracks, as a driver, where you feel like you can have a bigger impact on performance. The car performances are potentially more level compared to traditional tracks. All of that brings good opportunities. On my side, I see a weekend full of opportunities. I__ quite optimistic about what we can do, and I know it can be a great chance for us to get some points. It__ one of my favourite tracks. It__ always worked out quite well around here for me, and I__ looking forward to another year. I always see things from the bright angle. So, I see opportunities. I see some unknowns, which we should embrace rather than be afraid of. At the end of the day, I__ not too sure anybody knows what this is going to do. It might not change much. I think what remains extremely important is qualifying. We know if you get it right in quali, you__e done a big part of the job. But I__ sure it__ going to open up some potential strategy, which we__l have to be on top of. Alright. The enjoyment is probably a hundred out of ten. I love football. I love playing. I love the feeling. I used to play when I was a kid, and I absolutely loved every single game and practice. Now, to be able to play in this sort of event, especially in an iconic stadium, kind of reminded me of some of my dreams I had when I was a kid. It__ incredible to live this moment and, as you say, share a moment where you get the drivers, who are your rivals on track, but work together in this event, it__ quite a unique feeling. Yesterday, I was with Isack on my left, trying to work out how to score a goal, to defend together with Carlos. Charles used to play in the past. It__ just a nice event and a nice way to get into the Monaco race weekend. And we do it for charities. There was the Jules [Bianchi] Association we supported yesterday. It__ great to gather a lot of people _ the fans are happy, we are happy, and we raise some money to support charities. It__ a great win for everybody. It__ unique to Monaco and always a great highlight of the weekend. No. But maybe in the management. I like his mentality and his team spirit. Not on the pitch. He runs _ I must say he__ a great player because he just goes all out. Same as on track, he__ the same on the pitch. I__ not too sure for the body it__ the best, but at least for the team, it__ great. That__ a lot of questions. You__e going get told off for that! You can__ answer that question. It__ the same as saying who__ the best F1 driver of all time _ different generations. You__e got to go for Messi or Ronaldo, you know? It__ one of those two. Yeah. Zizou to me is my icon since I was a kid. That__ the one I looked up to. Whether you can say he__ the best of all time, it__ very tricky. But for sure, as a kid, initially my dream was to be a football player _ until the first time I jumped in a go-kart. That first lap out there, the dream of football just disappeared. Then it was all about Formula 1. But I kept playing football. And to be fair, if F1 had not been part of my life, I would have tried to pursue a career in football. Don__ think I would have made it, but at least it was clearly my second dream as a kid. Copy paste. More than anything, there is a lot of respect, and that__ the most important when we race together. One day I__l get it wrong, another day it might be Charles that gets it wrong. But we know we__e racing at the limit and it__ always with the right intention. Sometimes you go slightly over it _ it happens, and it will happen in the future. But we know the respect is there, which is the most important. Yeah, I fully agree with what Charles said. There__ no space for abuse in any sort of way, anywhere. It__ just sad to see really. I think F1 has been really good in that sense. The community we__e had over the years, really supporting _ but never really spreading hate. You can support any team or any drivers _ many different drivers _ but we__e never really seen that sort of hate happening. I hope people understand there are human beings behind everyone _ families, drivers, teams, mechanics, engineers _ and respect should come first, always. So yeah, we don__ want to see any of that. Same for me as for Isack and Charles. The footage you can see on the internet _ some of the laps Ayrton had around Monaco and the documentaries, those races in Monaco _ especially in the wet against Alain Prost... Being French, anytime you hear about Prost, you hear about Senna. They__e both been idols of mine since I was a child. I think there was a special connection _ the way he used to say what he felt behind the wheel around the streets here. That__ been a big part of why I admired him since I was a kid.",Monaco,thursday,Alpine
Charles Leclerc,"It was really cool. I mean, obviously, we are looking at it as Formula 1 drivers, and we always try and see all the small details that are not exactly the way we live things. But it's very Hollywood-like, and I think that__ really cool because it__ not just for F1 drivers in the end. It__ for a broader audience, and I thought it__ absolutely great for the sport to have a movie like that. The scenes are incredible. I'm super impressed by how the camera was put onto the cars and the angles that we see from the cars driving. I know that Brad drove the car a little bit himself, which is very impressive, and I'm sure he enjoyed it. So it__ really cool. And I think for F1 it__ amazing because we are reaching people that we wouldn't have reached without this movie. There__ a cool storytelling as well, so that__ nice. I mean, if you want an honest answer, then low, because unfortunately our car hasn't been particularly strong in low-speed corners. And there__ only low-speed corners here in Monaco. So on paper, it doesn__ look like the most promising track for us. But Monaco is so unique and so different from anything we race on over the season that we can have a good surprise once we put the car down tomorrow _ which I hope will happen. And if it does, then I hope to be there on Saturday because qualifying will remain the most important part of the weekend. But on paper, it__ going to be a tough one. Well, it can make a difference. I think there__ been years where we definitely did not expect to be on pole, and when you think that you have zero hopes, you just go for it _ maybe a little bit more than people that are trying to manage expectations in Q3. And you manage to do something special, like I think we did in 2021 where we were nowhere all season, but we managed to put it on pole here. So, I still have hopes that we can reproduce what happened last year. Obviously, it's still very fresh in my mind to come back in this paddock. The last time I was there, we won, and it was a very special moment for me. Of course. Of course, you believe in yourself. I know that on street tracks, it__ been relatively positive for me in the past, so I know that there__ an opportunity there. The only thing that I will say changes from this year compared to other years is that we have a very specific weakness, in my opinion, which are slow-speed corners. And Monaco being only slow-speed corners, it will be a very big achievement _ and a very big surprise as well _ if we are a lot better than what we expect. But yeah, the motivation that I have coming here is always very special. It__ a very unique track, very different to what we are used to everywhere else. And we can be surprised positively. So the hopes are still high, but let__ say that on paper, it doesn__ look as positive. No. We definitely don__ want to give up now. It__ still kind of early. I mean, we__e getting to mid-season soon, but we cannot afford to give up now. We__e seen last year the situation changed a lot since when McLaren brought those upgrades. I believe that in Barcelona will be another very important point of the season with this new regulation on the front wings, and then we__l see whether it benefits us or not. Then we__l have to make the decision _ probably Fred will have to make the decision _ whether it__ the right time to move on and prepare next season, that is going to be super, super important for everyone to be starting on the right foot. What is wrong with the car? I wish I knew. What__ in the pipeline? We__e got quite a few things, but I cannot give any timelines. And the timelines keep changing because the team is pushing a lot to bring them as early as possible. There are things, but whether it__ going to be enough to close the gap _ I hope so. But to be in front and fighting for wins, I__ not sure yet. Zizou. I personally don__ think so. At least for the points, I wouldn__ change or award more or fewer points for particular races. I think it__ a good system, the one that we have. Whether we should have points for qualifying _ maybe this is another matter, because in Monaco qualifying is super important and pretty special. But I__ happy with the system we have at the moment, so I wouldn__ change these kinds of things. Then we can think about ways on how to make the race more interesting in Monaco, but the point system is fine to me. That__ definitely one of the questions we also asked ourselves coming here. The answer _ we__l have it on track tomorrow. We don__ really know yet what to expect. But it is true that there__ only low-speed here. So obviously, we__l try and focus and put the car in the best place possible for low-speed corners, which normally on most other tracks you just try and find a compromise between high-speed content and low-speed content. But here, it__ all about low-speed. I hope we__l discover something new about our car that we haven__ seen yet since the beginning of the season. All cars will be affected by it, whether positively or not, again, that still remains to be seen. I honestly think we shouldn__ be too affected by it. But again, time will tell. We__l see if some other teams will be more affected and that will hopefully help us to close a little bit of the gap. I don__ think it__ going to be a game changer. I don__ think we__e going to see a massive change in the pecking order that we see today. But it might make a little difference, and I hope it will benefit us. Of course we did. Pierre is one of my best friends, so it__ not like we have any problems with each other. I remember when we were in karting, sometimes it happened that we crashed together. So, we__e used to having these kinds of conversations. And actually, I think we are two people that separate very well what happens on track and our relationship off the track. I know 100% that when he has the visor closed, he won__ give me any opportunities and vice versa. That__ the way it is, and it__ always been like that. It__ great that it__ that way as well. I remember that at the end of the last race I came to him and I was like, ""Yeah, I was a little bit hot at the beginning of the race and I just wanted to attack very quickly to be in front."" He was like, ""Oh no, no. It__ my fault."" Then he came back to me after watching the images and was like, ""Yeah, actually, you were a little bit too aggressive._ And I agree. So yeah, I think the actual incident _ there was nothing special there. The corners before I was a bit on the limit. Honestly, it__ just a frustrating situation, as  team, that we find ourselves in. When you__e in those kinds of situations and you__e starting P11, you haven__ got much to lose and you take more risks than people around you. I__ aware of this. But the actual incident where Pierre lost it _ it was just a racing incident. I don__ think there was any blame from either side. Sorry, on what? I wasn__ aware of all the details of the situation, but I think as a global picture, that__ never something you want to see. I think there__ a lot of respect. I__e grown up with F1 as a target and looking at it thinking it was incredible to see so many fans from different teams, but having a lot of respect. That__ what I want to see going forward, no matter what the situation is. Especially now with social media, it__ more and more toxic. There is more and more false information being spread. But the most important thing in any situation is respect first. It__ a shame to see these kinds of things in a sport like ours. Yeah, of course. He__ been a huge inspiration. I think everything he achieved _ especially in Monaco _ had a huge influence on me. My father witnessed and saw Ayrton in the streets of Monaco, actually racing here. Every time there was a Grand Prix, my father would explain to me how impressive it was _ especially in the rain. And you can also see some onboard footage from back then, which is just incredible. I think it__ part of the magic of Ayrton, and Monaco is definitely one of the most special laps he__ ever done. So, yeah _ it definitely adds to the myth. It__ not frustrating yet, because I haven__ hit the track yet. So for now, there__ just a huge motivation to try and surprise ourselves positively. And that will be the case until Sunday, really. I mean, then when you__e in the race on Sunday and you feel there__ no pace in the car _ that__ where the frustration actually starts, because you need to do 50 laps. I don__ know how many laps there are here _ more than 50? Alright. So the frustration will be very long if it__ there. But yeah _ no matter what, you give your best. Until qualifying, until you do that lap in Q3, you__e got the hopes of doing something magic because you don__ really know where you stand. You have some initial ideas of where you__e going to be fighting in qualifying, but until you get that lap in Q3 and everybody goes flat out, you don__ really know where you__e going to stand. So I__l have hopes until the end.",Monaco,thursday,Ferrari
Isack Hadjar,"Yeah. I mean, I had doubts at the start of the year. I didn__ have much testing, so I was a bit worried _ like, can I handle this car? Is it going to be too fast? But now I don__ have any doubts anymore, and I__e adapted to it quicker than I hoped for. So far, it__ been going better than I anticipated, which is _ for me _ I can__ dream of a better start. No. I mean, I think Monaco treated me well over the years. It__ where I signed my Red Bull contract as a 16-year-old, so it__ definitely a special place for me. What I like about this track is it__ the best qualifying session of the year by far, and that__ what I__ looking for. Yeah. It was tough on the legs. It was really tough. I__e never actually played 11 against 11 on a real-size pitch. So that__ done, for me. It was really hard _ much harder than I expected. I realised also my muscles are not made for football. Changing directions... it was tough. I nearly got injured? No, it__ fine. I__ okay. Something could give up anytime, you know? I felt weak. Same. Yeah. I made a helmet, actually, because, you know, I thought I could do it in Brazil _ it makes sense _ but I think to do it here makes maybe even more sense. Because there__ one king of Monte Carlo, and it__ Ayrton. As a kid, I watched a lot of clips on YouTube _ watching him basically demolishing everyone around here. I thought, ""Well, if I__ going to be a racing driver in Formula 1 and I__ going to race here, I want to pay tribute to him."" You can see on my helmet the statistics _ his pole laps, how many times he won, which years. I think it was a good idea.",Monaco,thursday,RB
Max Verstappen,"I think it__ just how difficult the track is to master in qualifying, to get the most out of it. Also knowing that overtaking is difficult on a Sunday, qualifying is even more important. It__ incredibly narrow, challenging, bumpy. The history, of course, of Monaco in general _ this is one of these races that you really want to win. It is very special to be racing here. It__ pretty insane, to be honest. But once you stand on the top step on the podium, it__ something where you__e like, __hat was a great weekend._ You__e like, __one!_ Well, I mean, if you take the average of Miami and Imola, I don__ think we look that great. So we have to be calm. Imola was a very good weekend for us _ I say weekend because Friday was not good. We just have to keep understanding our car a bit better, what we want with the set-up. This is a very different track. If you look at the season so far, we__e only really been properly competitive on high-speed corners. Monaco is not a high-speed track. I__ a little more reserved for this weekend. Even if you have the best car, to nail it in qualifying around here is very tough. We just have to see what happens tomorrow and work from there. I have no idea where we are in the order. Historically, we__e not been particularly great on street circuits. Hopefully we can change that a bit, but I don__ know. Well, it__ not about believing. It__ about where you finish in the last race, and we just keep working every race to be better and improve the situation. A lot can happen. If you asked me last year around this time, I__ have said, __eah, we__e going to win it. No problem._ But then a lot changed as well. It__ not for sure that it__ going to be straightforward to the end of the season. I think we still have to improve in areas, but that__ fine. We__l try to find the improvements. No. It__ better she stays at home. It__ more relaxed for her. I guess it also depends a bit where you are on the grid. Right? I__ say if you're on the back, you need to push flat out in Q1 to try and make it out. So let's first find out where we are in the grid. But then, yeah, Monaco is a special one where you do push, but the track is also coming to you quite a bit even in qualifying. So, you just have to be out at the right time. And of course, traffic can be a problem in Q1 _ a lot of cars out there. It__ always that fine line of how much you're willing to risk already, and making sure you__e in a good rhythm. At the end of the day, a lot is rhythm, because on a normal track it's a bit more straightforward. The grip is good, you have space, you get quite comfortable. But around here, I don__ think you ever feel super comfortable. You're always on the edge. So, through qualifying, follow the track, get into that nice rhythm. Make sure that the car is to your liking, make sure that the tyre is in the right window. It all sounds very easy, but it__ not that straightforward, unfortunately. And with the C6 compound now, I have no idea how they__e going to respond around here as well. That__ something we all have to figure out _ all the drivers, all the teams. I guess it can go both ways _ it can be quite straightforward, or it can go completely crazy because of Safety Cars coming into play or not making the right calls. I think it will spice it up probably a bit more. Normally, with one stop, once you have a good pit stop and everything is fine, then you drive to the end and just stay focused and not hit the barrier. But maybe with a two-stop, it can create something different _ people gambling, guessing when the right time is to box. So hopefully, it will spice it up a bit more. It was a good one, but honestly, around Monaco it's always very tough to say __hat was unbelievable_ because you never really feel super comfortable. But at the time in _23, I knew that I was down in the first two sectors, so I knew I had to risk a bit more. And it worked out well for me. It was a cool lap, and of course it meant a lot because it meant that you start first. Normally you win the race if you have a normal start. But like I said, normally, and now there__ a lot more that can go wrong with two stops. So, first, let__ see where we qualify and then we__l see what happens. But for sure, _23 was a good year and a cool qualifying around here. I wish I knew why the Fridays are not always great. We don__ do it on purpose, I swear. But it's been a bit more difficult just to get the car in the right window. I do think we learned quite a bit actually in Imola _ what we want from the car. It's not always easy to extract that now on a street circuit compared to Imola, but it was a very useful lesson. It gave me more confidence to push. We do a lot of simulator work. Although we have the simulator drivers, we communicate what we want from the car, what we need. Unfortunately, our car over the last year and a half _ maybe two years _ has probably had quite a narrow window. As soon as you're a little bit left or right, it becomes quite a bit more difficult to drive. That probably translates to a poor Friday. But the team is good at analysing and making the right calls for the next day. So, most of the time, we improve the situation _ and in Imola, it improved quite a lot. Yeah. Just the last few days, I was still at the factory designing the piston. So, yeah, I
think we found a good compromise. Now, I think it's going to be a rocket ship. So, we're ready! Honestly, I think no one _ of course, you can always be very confident in what you're doing, but at the end of the day, it doesn__ matter. It matters what you deliver next year. So we__l see. Time will tell. If you tell me what you do, I can tell you a little bit of what I do. I__l help you with the sim driving. I put the banker lap, and then you spend a hundred laps to beat it, and then we continue. Well, I think as a team you want both cars in the best possible position. But look at 2023, for example. If we have a good car, you will be fast and then it doesn't matter what the other teams do in terms of strategy because you will beat them. We have to make sure that we put ourselves back in that position. At the moment, sometimes it works _ in Imola, it was fine. When the car is working and you are comfortable with what you__e doing, then it doesn't matter what the other strategies are from the other cars or teams around you because you just follow your own strongest strategy. But naturally, as a team, we want to finish one-two every single weekend _ but that's tough at the moment. We have very strong competition. McLaren is doing a great job. So we just keep working, trying to improve _ for myself, for Yuki _ and we__l see in the coming races what we can do. Yeah. I notified FOM about that. They were well aware that I wasn__ attending. I wanted to spend more private time, because it is private time at the end of the day _ the evening also. I think it__ coming out on June 27? I__l download it on Apple. So yeah. Of course, I get it _ there was the opportunity to watch it, but if I watch it now or in three or four weeks, that__ fine as well. I heard good stuff from the movie, so I__ sure it__ going to be exciting. From when I started to now, I don't think it has changed a lot. It's very exciting. Like I explained before, the format _ the qualifying _ is very important. The track, like I said, is narrow. These cars that we have currently are, for me personally, a little bit too big. It would be better if we go back to some smaller, narrower cars. I think that would only help racing here around Monaco. Hopefully, we can achieve that a bit. I know the coming cars are going to be a little bit smaller, but I think it__ still not enough. Hopefully, in the future we can try and make them smaller again. But we__l see. Yeah. I don't know, really. I guess we'll find out tomorrow. But it is a fact that that's normally not our strong point. We'll see. I have no idea how it will respond. I think, of course, if you want to win a championship, you have to be consistent anyway. But I think what we have to focus on is just performance. The more performance we have, the easier we make it for ourselves. That__ what we__e trying to do _ finding more performance in our car, better tire life, all these kinds of things together. That__ our focus now for the rest of the year. I mean, everyone is doing that, but we want more. Yeah. I mean, it's going well. But this is something that I think you can't consistently ask of yourself. You want to try and improve. Some weekends are better than others. But overall, I__ quite pleased. But you can also not be fully satisfied. You always analyze everything that can be done better _ even on the positive weekends, but naturally also on the negative ones. And I'm sure you never stop learning in Formula One. Yeah. I mean, it's good. I like the competition. We used to do this already when Gabi was still in F3, F2. Now it's nice _ both of us are in Formula 1. Whenever we have free time, we race. Of course, with the Formula 1 cars, but also any form of gaming to be honest. It__ great that you can do that as drivers together. Gabi had quite a similar route to F1. He started in karting with CRG. He was telling me stories with the boss, with Giancarlo at the time _ who I also grew up with. So, it's very nice. Wherever I can say something or advise, I think I'm quite an open book, so I do that. And besides that, the healthy rivalry we have when we are on the simulator preparing for a weekend or whatever _ it__ good. You do battles, hot lapping at the same time, trying to beat each other. It's fun. Well, yeah, it depends on Gabi. I__ already competing. It__ more about his free time and what he wants to dedicate.",Monaco,thursday,Red Bull
Alex Albon,"Yeah. We should ask Max... How was the movie? It was good. I think they__e done a good balance, to be honest. It__ hard to not look at everything with a fine comb and just see it for what it is _ just relax and watch it as a movie. I know you were there. I don__ know if you had the same impression, but I think for Hollywood and for what we do, they did a good job. No. I wouldn__ say the best race. I don__ think it was my strongest weekend. I was actually on the back foot for most of the weekend, just not feeling that comfortable with the car, which is even more telling _ that even when things aren__ going fantastically, we can still come home with a P5. What__ been good for us generally is we__e made a step, clearly everywhere. Our race pace compared to the top teams as a midfield team is usually worse come race day than Saturday. But the last couple of races, we__e actually been pretty much on the money with where we__e left qualifying. It__ being putting us in contention with teams like Ferrari and even Mercedes. So, it__ been really enjoyable _ more than anything, just to be able to mix it with the top teams has been a lot of fun. I__e enjoyed that a lot. It__ a nice change. It__ interesting, because the last couple of tracks _ we knew Miami would suit us. We didn__ expect Imola to suit us. We__e definitely made setup changes along the way, but not to the point where we expected to be the speed we were at. So in many ways, it makes you think maybe we come here and we__e going to be just as quick. You__e kind of treading the line of careful optimism, where I think I think yes, there__ no reason why we shouldn__ be quick here. But at the same time, were we just good in the last two races? I don__ know. Honestly, similar to what Max is saying. I think with these cars and the weight of them around such a narrow track like Monaco, and also with these softer tyres _ it sounds strange, but it's actually easy to overdrive. You have to wait for the track to come to you and be quite disciplined in your driving. You don__ want to feel out of control. You can get to a point where you take so much risk that you're just not comfortable and you can__ build on it. What Max is saying about a bit more of a steady approach _ when it comes to Q3 and your final lap is when you start pushing the limits of comfortability and you're trading that with technique, lap time, and tire damage. It__ a bit of a mental game around here. It's not just about taking as much risk as you can because it's a street track. There's a skill to it. I think the biggest thing is _ obviously, we're doing this to shake it up. And the worry is that it doesn't shake it up and it just creates, like you're saying, a lap-one situation where everyone starts to come into the pits and just tries to take some of the space and use lap two, three, four, five _ whatever it may be _ to push. Who knows? The biggest thing if you speak to the team, and I think every strategist, is that we don__ really know how it__ going to play out. Especially in the midfield, it__ team-mates and how they help each other. A good example would be Jeddah last year with Haas, when Kevin made a race where he basically parked the bus and allowed Nico to have a free stop. When you do work that around a track like here with two stops, that's definitely possible. You don't want a race like that. That__ not to say I think it__ a bad idea to do a two-stop. I think we need to try something _ but it may not really change the style of the race. Yeah, I think especially if we__e not a factory team, then we're even more out of the loop than maybe a team like Red Bull would be. But at the same time, in the end, it's just more self-centred around our car. We're more focused around that _ trying to deliver the best car we can. The PU is the PU. It's almost the second phase. [inaudible question] In terms of a design point of view, yes. From what I understand, we__e pretty clued up on where the geometry of the car is going to be. But that__ about it. We've only really scratched the surface recently, and we__l definitely ramp it up as the season goes on. For now, I think also because we've had a good start to the year so far, we're maybe a little bit more focused on doing more prep toward the weekends themselves. Our time on the sim is quite valuable, and so far, we've shifted it a little bit more towards this year for now.",Monaco,thursday,Williams
Gabriel Bortoleto,"I think it__ a very Hollywood one, but it__ nice. It__ going to be very good for those that still don__ know the sport so much. It__ going to be very good for our sport. For us drivers, we live this every day, so we know every detail. Some stuff we realise _ I don__ want to give spoilers or anything _ but that__ what I__ sure will be good for the sport. And for those that don__ know so much about Formula 1, they can learn and get involved with us. I__ not so sure about that. I think Miami we were a bit better. In Q1 we went to Q2 with a bit more margin. Imola was not our best track. We went to Q2, but I don__ want to take any credit out. But at the end of the day, Yuki crashed and Berman got the lap deleted. It was not the best quali pace, but the race pace was a bit better. Unfortunately, we were not able to maximize the opportunities we got, so we didn__ manage to score any points. I think we are making progress, taking steps ahead. Let__ see _ in Barcelona, we__e bringing a new package, so maybe that can be a very good thing for us. Very tight. The F1 cars are quite big, and even driving the sim, you can see clearly it__ a super tight track. With these F1 cars going so quick, it__ going to be amazing. For a young driver, this is one of the races you always dream of racing _ the Monaco GP in Formula One. I__ really looking forward to starting the weekend and learning this track with the F1 car. Even if I raced here in the past, the approach with F1 is completely different. It__ going to be very interesting. I__ looking forward to it. I think it__ a bit difficult to know at this stage. It__ a bit too early, also comparing to other teams. Sometimes I try to ask Max, but he never tells me how they are doing with engine and car. But I think we are in a different situation right now. You can help me more than I can. That__ not true. I don__ spend a hundred laps. Only fifty! Anyway, I think we are still in an early stage. Some sim drivers are doing the work already in the sim for quite a while. But we are still focusing on 2025 and trying to improve a bit our car for now. I think it won__ take too long before Nico and I start to do the proper work for 2026 as well in the sim and understand where we are. That's a lie, first of all. It depends. When we drive together, I start beating him, then he goes and changes the whole set-up of the car to make it difficult. Then I spend a couple of hours trying to beat his lap time, and he goes around telling everyone, __ beat Gabi and he__ taken me two hours to beat me again_. So... No, I__ already spending a lot of time on sim racing as well. But, yeah, why not? If Max invites me to do some endurance racing, I__ happy to do it.",Monaco,thursday,Sauber
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, just braked too early. And, yeah, I mean, it was a good move by Max as well. So, disappointing, obviously, but I think we made a few wrong calls after that anyway. Not our best Sunday. Definitely a lot of things to look at and review from that one. But, yeah, well done to Max and Red Bull. It was a good move but also, they had pace today. We'll look back at that one and see what we can do a bit better. Yeah, it was tricky. Obviously, the VSC was perfectly timed for Max and Lando. I__ obviously used both my hard tyres at that point, so made the last restart pretty tricky. I tried my best to hang on to second, but, yeah, just had nowhere near enough grip. So, third it is. Yeah, it was tricky. I tried my best to hang on, but just didn__ have the grip. I tried my best and it was inevitable. I think it was inevitable that he was going to get past, but I wasn__ going to give up without a fight. Thank you very much. I think, obviously, slight disappointment, probably. It's never a great day when you start first and finish third. So, yeah, just not a great day. I think Turn 1 was not ideal. I think in the end, our stop timing wasn't_ I think the race panned out differently to how we expected at the start of the first stint. So then the timing of the VSC and the safety car, the race was very tough from very early on. Honestly, given people had fresher tyres at the end, hanging on to a podium is not a bad result. And you__e going have tough days in the championship, and this is clearly one of them. So as long as we learn the lessons, then that__ all I can ask. Yeah. I mean, I thought I had it pretty under control, and it was a good move from Max. So, yeah, I__l learn for next time clearly. But at that point, I wasn__ overly concerned to not be in the lead, but then our pace just wasn__ as strong as I expected. So that compounded that first corner. Not clear, but I think a lot of people around were struggling. I was starting to struggle a bit. We kind of discussed it a bit, I guess, but it__ something we still need to go through more clearly. Because I think, yeah, maybe we reacted a bit too quickly. But, yeah, we__l have a look. It's a circuit I enjoy. Last year was a really good weekend for me, so hopefully we can go one better this year. That would be nice, but it__ going to be interesting to see how these _ well, it__ the same tyres as this weekend _ but how they perform in a very different environment like Monaco. And then obviously a two-stop race. So, yeah, let__ see. But I think confident that we__l be quick and try and go again. Yes. I definitely would have done something different. I would have braked ten metres later probably. Yeah. That__ all. Live and learn.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, it was a long race from that perspective. Not easy to overtake, but we did what we could. I think Max drove a good race. They were quick today__robably a bit quicker. We couldn__ keep up, and we had a good little battle at the end between Oscar and myself, which is always tense, but always good fun. But a good race. From us as a team, second and third is great. Of course, we would love to be up there fighting against Max, but they were too good for us today. Yeah, I mean, it__ with George, and I could tell he was struggling with the tyres a lot. It's just a situation you got to take advantage of. I mean, it__ always risky. You never want to take too much risk, but we__e also racing. And he__ a fair racer. He__ a good racer. So, some good moves today. [laughs] Thanks! I mean, it's probably the best result I thought we could really achieve today. I probably just didn't expect the Red Bull to be quite as quick as they were. I'm happy with second. From fourth, it was a good race. But, yeah, Max was too fast today. It was a fun one. I don__ know. It didn__ really feel great anywhere, to be honest. It didn__ feel wonderful to drive. But sometimes it doesn__, and you're just quick. So it's a little bit difficult to say. It's just a very bumpy track. A lot of these high-speed corners, where we seem to maybe struggle a bit comparing to the Red Bulls. That__ where we__e suffered the whole season so far, the high-speed corners. So we have to work in that area, and maybe that__ proved to hurt us a little bit more this weekend. But we said it from the beginning that we have to keep working hard. Max has outqualified us several times, and their pace just converted today onto Sunday. Sometimes they've been ahead, but their pace on Sunday has not been too strong. They've maybe worked on some things, and their pace was better today. That__ the price we pay for not being quick enough. I've not even thought of it yet, to be honest. So, yeah, normal amount. Whatever that is. No. Yep. No. There__ nothing. Yeah. I mean, it was a good battle between us. I was just on the fresher tyres, so I was always going to have that slight advantage on him. And, yeah, just with the DRS, I managed to have a good last couple corners. I knew that was going to be probably my, not my one chance, but you saw once I passed him how easy it was to pull away. It  was clear he was just struggling with the tyres, which I think everyone did quite a lot of today. It was a close one. I don__ know how close we got into Turn 1, but we__e both racing, we both want to beat one another, and it was good that we could race close like that today. I don't know. Like I said, I don't know how close we got.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. The start itself wasn__ particularly great, but then I was still on the outside line__r basically the normal line__nd I was like, __ell, I__ just going to try and send it around the outside._ And it worked really well. That, of course, then unleashed our pace, because once we were in the lead, the car was good. I could look after my tyres and we had very good pace on it today. So, again, massive improvement from Friday, and I__ very, very pleased with that. Then that VSC was quite handy to pit. And even then, even on the Hard compound, I think our pace was very strong. But then, of course, there was a Safety Car, so the field was all back together. But even then, on the restart, I think we managed it all really well and, yeah, brought it home. Incredibly proud of everyone. It__ been a very important week for us. The car has performed really well. And also, I think the whole execution of the race__hen to pit, the pit stops themselves__hey were all very good. Yeah. I mean, I like driving. I like racing in Formula 1. I like racing any kind of car. And, of course, next week is a completely different kind of track in Monaco. You know, that__ also going to be very challenging. But for the moment, I just want to enjoy today and really take it in. Yeah, I mean, it__ always fantastic to be in Italy. Proper passion for motorsports. So, yeah, it__ fantastic to see all these fans out here the whole weekend. So, yeah, thank you very much for coming and supporting all the drivers. Yeah, the initial start wasn't that amazing, but then Turn 2, luckily, worked out quite
well for me. So I was, of course, happy to be in the lead, but I was still not entirely sure how quick we were going to be because, of course, I was also in the lead in Miami, but we did not have a great pace there. So, I just tried to follow a bit my rhythm. I do think the car felt a bit nicer, a bit more controlled to drive now also in the long run, and that helped me, I think, also then look after the tyres probably a bit more than normal. So, yeah, overall, quite surprising, but, of course, very happy with what we showed today. Just hope that we can, you know, show this kind of performance a bit more often. I think it's a bit like I started to carry a bit more speed to the apex. And then at one point, you have that kind of momentum swing then going into Turn 3. And then, of course, I knew that I was ahead, but it all goes so fast. And you have to be really precise, you know, to try and not go too far offline. But, yeah, luckily, the grip was alright there. It's bumpy. So, yeah, my back is pretty hurting. Not a lot. I mean, they were getting quite destroyed. It was already quite hard to be consistent in those last few laps. So, it wouldn't have been long before I think I was in. Yeah, for sure. I mean, that's why we just kept on going. I think Lando and I would have done a one-stop. I do think again, you know, this track has quite a few high-speed corners, which I think our car likes. I also think we took a step forward with the setup of the car, which helps. Monaco is, of course, very, very different. So, let's see how we are going to perform there. You know, last year was very difficult for us. I don't expect it to be a lot easier this time around because there's, of course, a lot of low speed, but we'll see. I mean, it's just one race on the calendar, where you try to do the best you can. Even after that, there's a lot of races left, but, of course, you can clearly see that once we go to high-speed tracks and corners, then we are more competitive. I think it's very track specific. I mean, every time that we have been really competitive, it__ been high-speed tracks, high-speed corners. We still have work to do, but I do think it__ been a very positive weekend for us. Of course, we brought upgrades. I think they worked. Friday was very difficult still, but then I think we found a better set-up for Saturday. And I just hope that we can use that a bit more often because it definitely brought the car in a better window. Now, that was here. Monaco again _ like I said, at the moment, I__ not really... I mean, I love driving in Monaco, but it__ not been our strongest track with the car that we have. But we__l see what we can do. And then we go to Barcelona _ normally, a lot of high-speed corners, which is great. A lot of tyre deg as well, which again will be crucial to master. And I don__ know, of course, how that is going to work for us at the moment. But, for now, just very happy with this weekend, and we just go from there. Yeah. I don__ know. I mean, I love driving here, but at the end of the day, you're still bound to what you get, right, with your car. Now I think the last few years our car has always been working really well here. Of course, before I got here this weekend, I didn__ really have a lot of hope that we could actually win a race here. But then I think from yesterday onwards, the car was more competitive over one lap and luckily also today. So, yeah. I definitely enjoy driving here, but at the same time, the car has to work as well, you know, to be able to do this. Losing these kind of tracks is a shame. I get it from F1__ side of things, of course _ the new tracks that we are going to. So, yeah, you have to see it from a sportive side and a financial side, right? If you want to grow the business and make it more popular, I get it. For me, of course, personally, when I just speak about the enjoyment of driving, it__ these kind of tracks that made me fall in love with racing in general _ in go-karting even, because you have the same thing in karting where some tracks are more special than others. Yeah. I mean, I was quite far back. At the time before braking, I was basically in P3. But, of course, I was on the normal braking line, but I still had to come from far. And as soon as I braked late and then came off the brakes, I felt like, okay, there might be a move on. So, I just carried the speed in. And, luckily, it basically was sticking. It's not an easy move to make, but luckily, everything went well.",Emilia-Romagna,post-race,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I mean, it was a great session. Very tough session, with all the delays, the red flags, and then also the tyres. The tyres have been very, very tricky today. I think after yesterday everyone thought the C6 was not too bad, and then today it was a real mystery. So, the team did a great job, got the car in a nice window. We__e been trying a few different things this weekend and we got into a nice place for qualifying. So, the lap was good. I had about four cars in the last corner, which didn__ help, but it was enough. So very, very happy with the job well done, and yeah, I__ excited for tomorrow. Yes, I mean, I wasn__ thrilled to be the first car on track, but I had quite a big gap in the run before anyway, so it wasn__ actually that much different for me. Of course, you lose the slipstream going first, but you don__ have any disturbed air, you don__ have any dirty air. I think that definitely helped me out a little bit. But yeah, that__ what we chose to do. I think we__e got enough pace to be able to do that and stick to our guns, and that__ what we did. So the team did a great job of executing that one. It was good. I was happy with it. I feel like in Q3 I really found my groove. It wasn__ the easiest of days, really. FP3, I think everyone put the Soft tyre on and started scratching their heads a bit, and then qualifying itself obviously had a lot of red flags, a lot of long delays. It was hard to build into a rhythm. But I think by Q3 I found my feet, and the last lap of Q3 was a good one. Yeah, I thought it was going to unravel at the last corner with a few people trying to start their laps, but it was enough to get through there and still get pole. I thought it was going to be tough to beat. I felt like my first lap was very strong. I think when I got back to the garage, I saw that there were a few things that could have been a bit better. And yeah, found a little bit in a few places, and that was enough in the end. So yeah, felt like I definitely had to find a bit more for that final run, and I think I did a good job doing it. It was a struggle, to be honest. I think_ [To George] after you and your banana _ don__ get your banana too close to me. Your question was the C6 tyre? Oh yes. Yeah, I mean, we all put it on in FP3, and I don__ think anyone really went any faster. My car certainly felt worse when I put that tyre on. But when you have four of them for qualifying, you don__ have many options. So it was definitely a struggle. Had to be pretty careful through the lap to not destroy it straight away. And obviously, George qualified on the Medium at the end, which, if I had a few more, I probably would have wanted a similar thing. I think as long as I can get a good start, then confident. You know, it's a difficult track to overtake on. I think our pace has been strong. Our long run pace yesterday looked very encouraging. So yeah, as long as I can get a good start and have a good first lap, then that would be good. I said on Thursday, if we don__ come back here, it is going to be a shame. Again, I think having two races in the same country in today__ F1 maybe doesn__ make the most sense given how many countries want to hold a race. But I agree, we need to be careful. We need to be careful not to lose all the historical tracks that have been here forever because at least 75% of them are the favourites for the drivers. If you ask the drivers their top three favourites, it__ probably a mix of Silverstone, Suzuka, Spa, here and probably Zandvoort. Here is probably going to disappear, now Zandvoort is disappearing, Spa is on a rotation. I think Monza is pretty safe _ we__e got some other problems if Monza disappears. But we do need to be careful to keep all these tracks. A qualifying session around Imola and tracks like Imola are definitely more exciting than some other tracks on the calendar. But it's obviously a balance. I think it's just us all going faster. Dropping the fuel, increasing the engine modes, pushing harder. You probably don't explore the limits of the tyre or overheat it as much yesterday when we're going about_ I don't know how much slower we were yesterday _ maybe not that much in the end. But I think when you start to push things even further, the tyres eventually just gave up. They were struggling yesterday already, but today I think the C5 was faster than the C6, probably, or it certainly felt nicer. So, I think when you push it even further, you just expose the weakness of the tyre even more. I mean, let's see tomorrow. The softer tyres are more with Sunday in mind to try and add more pit stops. I think Pirelli have done a better job this year with the tyres, and I think that's why we're seeing more one-stop races. So, there are positives _ for us anyway _ of these one-stop races and tyres that feel a bit better. But we'll see after tomorrow. If tomorrow is still a one-stop race, then obviously it's probably back to the drawing board a little bit more. But it's not easy to make a tyre that performs well over one lap and then doesn't destroy itself in the race. So, we'll see after tomorrow. That will be a better test of whether these soft compounds have worked or not. I mean, not really. Obviously, when there's a shunt that big, it's hard to not look at it. But I think generally in racing _ and in a lot of things in life _ when you start to second guess or doubt what you're doing, that's when things go wrong. You need to commit, especially on a track like this. So, of course, you probably think about it a little bit, but by the time you get to the corner, you're back in the groove of doing what you've done the rest of the weekend.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think everything was going really well. Just the softest compound is very difficult to keep them alive around the lap. So, yeah, Sector 1 was good and then the tyres again fell away from me from there onwards _ tiny margins. But I mean, it was cool. But then you could see George, he set his lap on the Medium, so, yeah, maybe they were a bit too soft for this track and for us at least it was a bit more difficult to extract the most out of it. I felt a bit happier on the Medium, but the race is tomorrow. That__ where you score the points, of course, so that__ what we have to focus on. But I do think that today was a very good day for us. Let__ see. I mean, last race was not really a fight. I hope that we just pick up a bit of pace, have a bit more of a stable car and then hopefully we can look after our tyres a bit better. Not a lot. Yeah, it was alright. I think compared to yesterday, we improved a lot again. The car is a lot nicer to drive. The only problem I had in qualifying was basically the faster I wanted to go, the more problems I had with the tyres just overheating. That was holding me back in Q3 already, run one. And then when I tried to go faster on the second run, Sector 1 was great, and then I just ran out of tyres. I just started understeering more, and just tried to keep the lap together, really. But yeah, that's a bit of a shame. Of course, we came in and I saw George was on a Medium. And honestly, I also felt better in FP3 on the Medium. But you don__ really have the tyres to qualify on it properly. And of course, for tomorrow, we want to make sure we have the tyres in a good window. Quite a bit because it__ the first time with the C6 as well, so I think no one is really on top of it yet. But it__ clear that probably for a track like this, it__ really on the limit or already a bit over the limit. Yesterday was a tough start, but I think today we definitely put it in a better window. I was a bit happier with how the car was coming alive and also the balance of the car. So that__ a positive. It__ just that the tyre compounds this weekend didn__ really help us by being that soft because we know we overheat our tyres more than we would like. So that is still a focus point for us. I don__ know. I__l just try to do a good start and see where I__ at with the pace, because yesterday wasn__ particularly good in the long run also. And then yeah, just see with the new set-up we have on the car. Hopefully it all sticks a bit better on the tarmac and, hopefully, in general a bit more competitive. I don__ know yet. I don__ think many people will touch the C6 if you need to do a lot of laps in a row, but we__l see tomorrow. Yeah, I 100% agree. It depends also a bit on the cars, right? I do think the cars that we have now just don__ really work that nicely on a street circuit, unfortunately. They__e way too big, too stiff, too heavy. I would say they don__ really come alive compared to like 2016 even. I know the lap times were a lot slower, but at least then on a street circuit the car still came alive a bit. You could take some kerbs and it was working. Now everything feels a bit dull. But yeah, on tracks like this, it is a lot of fun. So many fast corners, and the limit is the gravel or the grass. That makes it more exciting and more difficult to nail. Yeah, I think it's just the layout of this track. Too many high-speed corners. Probably when you go to a more low-speed corner track, it probably will be a little bit better. So, let's see next week how that will go. Well, first, of course, I asked if he's OK. And I heard yeah, he's OK. But then I saw the replay _ I'm like, __esus, is he really OK?_ It was a big impact, a lot of damage as well. But the most important is that Yuki is okay. I'll probably see him in a bit.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,Red Bull
George Russell,"Yeah, we were going for it. We thought maybe the Medium tyre would be a fast one and it turned out to be a good choice. Of course, a small compromise now for tomorrow, but it was worth it to be back in the top three. Really happy with the performance. Very close to Oscar, which again, is always a surprise when you're so close to the McLaren because they__e so good at the moment. But it was, yeah, a good afternoon. I mean, it was very challenging because opening the lap, we almost missed the flag. I was in first gear starting my lap, I lost a tenth down the straight because I was so close to Sainz. But, you know, nevertheless, really happy with P3. I think we could not have really achieved much more today, but ultimately we need to focus on tomorrow and try and get back on the podium. I was P4 on the Soft tyre, only half a tenth behind Lando, and I had a mistake on that lap. Somehow, I accidentally short shifted coming out of Turn 12 and it just bogged down into fifth gear, and I lost about a tenth. So, I felt that I should have been P3 after the first run. And then it was really tight at the end. I almost missed the flag, and I opened my lap in first gear coming around the last corner because of traffic, and I lost a good tenth down into Turn 1. So that Medium tyre was definitely performing well. But I think had I been on the Soft, I probably would have still been P3. No, that was always a plan from before the session. I felt quite strong on that tyre yesterday and today. It was a bit of a risk because nine times out of ten, that will be the start tyre or we will use that tyre at some point in the race. So, in the unlikely event of a puncture or a flat spot, you__e pretty destroyed because then you__ have to use a C6 soft tyre in the race. It didn__ come without any risk, but it was a risk worth taking. We wanted to put it all on the table and I__ pretty happy with P3. It__ been a bit of a challenging weekend to be honest. I was very surprised how close we were in qualifying. But like Max said, the tyres have been very challenging to get on top of. You look at Sainz in Q2 being the quickest _ that came out of nowhere _ and I think he then went slower in Q3. When you find that sweet spot, there__ a lot of lap time. And both of my laps in Q3 felt very strong. I found that sweet spot with the tyre and found about four tenths compared to every other lap I did this weekend. So I was pretty happy, but it__l be challenging for all of us to fight with Oscar tomorrow, and we__l do our best to hold off Lando. For us, it__ definitely the most exciting of all of the season when we come to these types of circuits. I do also appreciate the fans watching _ I don__ know if they share the same excitement on a track like this versus a track that isn__ as enjoyable for us to drive. So, you need to find that balance. As we__e said before, we do love that character, but it is very difficult to race around here in Imola. It__ difficult to race in Zandvoort. And Japan wasn__ straightforward either. The new tracks, although they do miss some character, do usually produce good racing. Yeah, like Oscar said, I do feel the concept of going softer to create more variety in the race is the right idea. But we sort of pre-empted this _ that there will be many tracks where the C5 is better than the C6. So, then it begs the question: do you want to go back to the alternative tyre allocation where you've got to do a Hard, Medium, Soft in qualifying? And then you have more sensible tyres during practice sessions _ then we can do more laps, the fans can watch us drive more. I feel that would be a sensible midpoint _ sort of mandating the Hard, Medium, Soft for the three sessions. Otherwise, based on today, next time we go to a relatively medium-high speed circuit with a C6, everyone will be qualifying on a C5, and it shouldn't be like that. No. Yeah, it was great to see that he's OK. With a crash like that, it shows how impressive these cars are in a situation like that. But I think for all of us, once the helmet's on and the visor's down, you have to get cracking, and you__e got to take anything like that out of your mind.",Emilia-Romagna,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Franco Colapinto,"Really excited. You know, everything is new again. We start from zero. It wasn__ the nicest to be_ after doing the last nine races of last year and then having to step out. It was not what I wanted, but it was a good time to reflect on what happened and to learn from it. So, happy to be back. Of course, it's never nice circumstances when it happens like this, when you step in another driver's seat, but you never really choose the moment you do it in Formula 1. I just take it, try to do my best and try to maximise it for the job. There has been a lot of work in the background. Apart from the last couple of days, also before. I__e been doing a lot of sim work for the team. Of course, not trackside but still helping the team to try to develop the car during race weekends. It has helped me a bit to learn the car, the tools, the different settings the team is running, because I__ not very used to it. It__ quite a big switch from one team to another, so it has been helpful. And then, of course, the prep since it got announced has been very strong. We__e been doing a lot of things in the sim. So happy. It's been a really long time since I__e been in a race weekend. A bit rusty maybe, but I think it__ going to come off very quickly. I drove the day after it was announced, in Zandvoort. So I think it was one day before you guys were there. A lot of fans, it wasn__ really a private test. It was OK. Still getting kind of used to it. The body had to adjust. So it was tricky at the start, but it just takes a while. Imola is a tough track physically. It__ not like my start in Monza, which is the easiest one of the year. But it__ great to be back. It__ great that it happens in Italy as well. I have really good memories here and in Monza too. So yeah, excited about the weekend. I think just try to focus on myself. It__ very tricky to have any expectations. I haven__ even driven the car yet, so lots of things to learn. But I think we are doing the right steps and if we go little by little, I think I__ going to arrive to a decent place. I think as a driver, I__ just trying to go step by step. I don__ really know the car, so a lot of new things coming and I just want to do the basics right and then the results are going to come. I__ not really expecting any kind of result. The performance of the teams is so tight and it changes from track to track. At the end, in FP1 and FP2 we don__ really have a clear view of where we are at. We__e still working a lot with the team. The main goal is to make the car quicker as well. We need to find a lot of performance, and I think that__ going to come with a lot of work from everyone. So that__ the main goal _ to try and improve the performance and then of course, after these five races, we__l see. I agree as well. I guess it__ good they are hearing them, because they have been in for a while. I love Imola. I love Italy. I have some great memories and great history here. I started in Monza _ that was my debut in Formula 1 _ and now it's Imola. Still in Italy, but with Alpine. I love Imola. It__ a great track with massive history in Formula 1. I think we all like coming here. The history this brings to the sport, it__ a great track, and especially to drive a Formula 1 car here. There are specific corners _ it__ such an old-school track, it__ very enjoyable to drive. So yeah, I__ going to try to enjoy this weekend and hopefully it stays. I don__ really think it__ such a new thing. I__ much more relaxed. I__e had the experience of racing, I__e had the experience of being in a race weekend with a different team. I still have that feeling _ I__e been racing in December, so it__ not that far away. It doesn__ feel the same as Monza. Monza was massive excitement, everything was new, it was the first time I was going to be part of a Formula 1 grid. Here it feels a bit different. It__ still my dream come true_ so the feelings are the same _ but now I want to work with the team. It__ not only about the dream of becoming an F1 driver, it__ about working towards the team__ goals. Getting good results, being consistent in the points _ that__ what we want to achieve. So yeah, let__ focus on the job and see what we can do. For me it__ great. Look, I love Alpine. I think Renault and Alpine have a massive history, a big legacy in the sport. And yeah, I think it__ a great step in my career as well to be racing for them. It__ tricky__fter the World Cup, some sparks are there, but it's more from the French towards Argentina. We are fine with them, we beat them, so we are OK. Look, I__ really happy here. I__ in a happy place and have a really good relationship with the engineers, with the mechanics. Everyone around the team has been very supportive and I__ really happy to be here. So excited to start the work. Of course, new faces, new names, everything on the set-up, on the settings, everything is new and different. So we need to adjust to it, but I__ sure we__e going to do a good job. I don__ know. We__l see once I drive. But you know, I have a great opportunity ahead. I__ happy to be in F1. I don__ even think in terms of five races____ just in a happy place and I__ dealing with it very well. I think at the moment I just want to get back in the seat and drive. And of course, after you heard Carlos__specially Carlos__aying that he needs like 10 races to get used to a car, I think five is not enough for me. I__e only driven nine in my life in F1. So yeah, it probably takes me a few more races, probably a couple more than five to get up to speed and maximise everything out of the car. But it is what I have and I just want to maximize it, enjoy it and try to do the best for the team. Same as last year. I think it was even worse last season. You know, the Argentinian fans and I think Latin American fans__hey are very passionate, very euphoric and they love supporting their athletes and people that they feel close to them. They__e always been there and they__e always been very supportive. But yeah, I think we always try to keep the respect for all the drivers on the grid__hat__ the main thing the fans should do and something to improve on. At the end it__ the same. I had to manage this last year. I had a bit of time to read some stuff and now I__ racing and everything is deleted again. So yeah, focus here. Last year everything was new and it was very tricky to take in all the information. I think now I__ only six races behind everyone that has been racing already__volution-wise, tyre-related, I just don__ have the knowledge of those first six races. But I__ much closer than last year. Last year I had zero experience. I hadn__ had any testing. I just had 300k of running in an F1 car before I drove in Monza. It was much trickier. I think I felt more pressure there, just because everything was new. This year, just having that extra experience, having that knowledge of having already raced in Formula 1 is going to help me a bit. So yeah, hopefully it does. Yeah, just can__ wait to jump in the car.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,Alpine
Lance Stroll,"Yeah. I mean, it__ a track I just always enjoy coming back to. It's got great character. It__ one of those old-school tracks. It__ just fun to drive and somewhere I__e always enjoyed racing, so it__ good to be back. We just need to find more speed, more performance. We picked up a few points in Miami, which was good, but it was just circumstance, with the rain and stuff in the Sprint, so we took advantage of that. But we__e not in a position to score points every weekend just on pure pace. We need to look for performance in all areas and just keep pushing. I just don__ think it__ too different. We just haven__ made progress. It__ just kind of the same. No, it__ not. It__ just the same. But if you__e not putting a lot of lap time on the car every week and developing the car, then you just kind of fall backwards. I think that__ where we__e ended up. We__e just not putting the lap time on the car that we hope to be putting and that__ why we__e in a tricky spot right now. Yeah, I think naturally there are tracks that suit the car better than others. But we__e been to a lot of different kinds of tracks this year and we haven__ been extremely competitive at any of them. So yeah, we__l see how we go this weekend. Yeah, I agree with everything Oscar said. I think he summed it up well. Yeah, I mean, I enjoy coming here. There are a few tracks on the calendar that are very historical and great to drive. This is one of them. It would suck to lose it. But we have 25 races and a lot of countries want races. It__ tough to squeeze them all in. Hopefully this one stays _ I like coming here.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,Aston Martin
Oscar Piastri,"It was very cool. Definitely an experience that I probably won__ have again. It was a special day, obviously a real honour to receive the award, but even more so than that, just seeing some of the really passionate Italian fans. Considering I don__ drive for the team in red, it was impressive to see how many people were there. Also, to meet some of my now very, very distant relatives, from where my family name originated, was very special. I__ now an honorary citizen of Licciana Nardi in Italy, which is where my great, great _ maybe great _ grandfather was from. So it was a special day. Another home race. Another one! I mean, it__ pretty hard to say that I__ not. When you__e won four out of six, it__ been a great start. I__e been enjoying the success we__e been having on track, but for me what__ been very satisfying is all the work we__e done behind the scenes to achieve that. It__ quite a different feeling when you win a race because you feel like you__e just gotten by or had good circumstances. But to now be winning because we have an incredibly quick car and I feel like I__ driving well, that__ very satisfying. Of course, I__e been enjoying standing on the podium as well. But more so the hard work behind the success. I think we saw a similar thing in Melbourne in the wet conditions, but Miami was potentially a circuit we were looking forward to from pretty early on. With the hotter temperatures, given some of the sessions we__ had earlier in the season, we thought that might play more to our strengths. And I think Sunday in Miami proved that. I__ not expecting that to be the case every weekend. I would love that to be the case, but in those hotter conditions and that circuit characteristic, it worked well for us. I think it__l be difficult to repeat that consistently. We__l see what we can do. I don__ know. We__e got very soft tyres this weekend, so maybe that will help us. But it__ a lot cooler than it was in Miami. The track is also incredibly different _ much bumpier, much higher speeds in general. I expect the competition to be closer than it was in Miami. We saw in qualifying that the competition was on our heels and ahead of us. So we still have to make sure we go out and execute everything as well as we can, because if we fall through a little bit, then we__e got plenty of competition that can beat us. I mean, I think we have the strengths and characteristics to keep winning races, definitely. I think we__e seen at various tracks that the competition is close. I__ not expecting every weekend to look like Sunday did in Miami. Friday and Saturday in Miami didn__ look as good as Sunday, that__ for sure. So I think there will be a lot of competition, but I feel like I__ driving well at the moment. I feel like the team__ doing a really good job helping me get the most out of myself, get the most out of the car. Clearly the car is very strong. So yeah, I think we have the potential to have a really good year, but I__ not too concerned about that at the moment _ just trying to win more races. I think the fact that there have been changes made is good. Also, the things in fine print, the stewards have a lot more control now, which I think is a good thing because the circumstances definitely need to be taken into account. So I think it's a good step forward. That__ all I__e got. I think one of the big things for the FIA was putting something in for abusing officials, which I think is very fair and reasonable. I think maybe some of the other areas got a bit caught up in that sentiment and felt a bit harsh. But I think there are some genuine reasons behind what they__e doing. I think they__e listened to some of our feedback and the changes are in the right direction. I don__ think it changes very much to be honest. Obviously you want to have the edge at the end of the season _ that__ where it__ most important. For me at the moment, the results have been a good confidence boost for myself, so that__ always important. If we have competition outside McLaren, there are benefits to being first _ like with pit stops and strategy. If you__e ahead in anything, there are always advantages. But in terms of the mentality and feeling in the team, we__e still trying as hard as we can to beat all the other teams _ and also each other. I think that__ going to remain the same for the rest of the year. Yeah, I mean it__ a great circuit. I__e only raced here once, but it__ definitely towards the top end of my favourites. I think having two races in the same country, with how many bids we have from around the world, maybe doesn__ make that much sense anymore. And when you have Monza as your second race in Italy_ it__ pretty hard not to go to Monza. I think there__ be some riots if we didn__! So for me, we just need to be careful to preserve the history. Zandvoort is going, Spa is going to be on rotation, which I__ not the happiest about. We just need to be careful not to lose these historical tracks. OK, maybe it__ not the best track to race on _ not the best for overtaking _ but in terms of the ultimate experience of driving an F1 car, this is at the top of the list. We need to be mindful of that. I mean, it__ a tough situation all round. Obviously it was a short time in F1 for Jack. Franco is coming in with these five races, which is also not an easy circumstance to come back into F1. Yeah, I think it__ a tough situation. For Jack, he can be proud of what he__ achieved. He still became an F1 driver, and no one can take that away from him. It__ a difficult situation, but it__ not really for me to comment on now. I honestly haven__ read anything because I__e not been concerned. Maybe next time we__l put some little figurines in a water slide as well __ don__ know__e__l come up with something. But clearly it__ all been passed. I had no concerns. Play on. I think the preparation is mostly the same. Through the year and especially at the end of the season, you always reflect on the things you can improve and do better. It__ just been about how you do things more efficiently. How you take the next step up in your preparation. But it__ not as simple as doing 60 laps on the simulator instead of 50 or spending one more hour somewhere. It__ mostly been the same, just we__e been working very well. Experience naturally helps. Some of the things that you have to concentrate on become more natural, so you__e constantly learning and that experience definitely helps. But the preparation has mostly been the same. We've just been trying to find those little bits in every column. There hasn't been one big change__ust trying to find little bits everywhere.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,McLaren
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, it was good fun. Last night there was a game and we won. The city went pretty crazy. I was out there as well, but not for long though because I still had to come to the track this morning. But like everyone was sounding the klaxons on the street, it like, going crazy. It was good fun. I enjoyed it. Well, for sure it feels amazing. I think this one is my proper home race because, of course, we have Monza as well, but I live probably 30 minutes away from the track [here]. So I would say it is my proper home. I'm really excited. I really like the track as well. I think it's a really challenging track, old-school. It__ really good fun to drive around here. And yeah, of course, I feel this weekend is going to be a special one, especially racing in front of all the Italian fans, my family, and friends. So it's going to be intense as well. But yeah, really excited to hit the track tomorrow and see what we can do. Well, I don't know. Hopefully more Kimi Antonelli! But yeah, Ferrari is so big that it would be a bit ambitious to see more of my flags. But I would not complain. Well, definitely a lot more than I had in Melbourne. Just getting at east with the car and understanding the tyres as well. I think where I made a really big step was trying to extract the best out of the tyre and trying to put them in a more decent window for the lap. Miami was a really good step because Sprint qualif was great. The actual qualifying was still good because we were still up there. That definitely gave me a boost of confidence. The race didn__ go as I wanted, but it didn__ hurt my confidence. Now that we're into the European season _ definitely tracks that I know much better _ definitely the approach will be different. I can focus a lot on driving, but also I can focus more on trying to give the best advice about the car to the engineers in order to improve and progress even more during the weekend. So definitely really excited to start the European season. I should ask him, but in the family, we__e very superstitious, so we don__ really talk about this stuff. I mean, Also, Miami. I__l make an example. I was really excited and actually thinking about the podium, and then the races went terribly wrong _ both in the Sprint and the long race. So we__e a very superstitious family and we just take it step by step. Of course, sometimes it happens to think it would be amazing to get a podium, especially at the home race, and that__ for sure the goal. To step on the podium would be the ultimate goal. Of course I want to win, but looking at it in a more realistic way, I think doing a podium here would be the dream and that__ what I__ really going to push for. Well, I don't feel like I'm in the position to just_ because I__e so much to learn still on my side. I feel like as a team we're doing a great job. The car has been consistent every weekend and that allows us to build the confidence. Of course, the gap to McLaren is still big. I mean, Miami was the real picture of the situation. McLaren were flying during the race and it was impossible to catch for anyone else. So I think as a team, we're really trying to work hard to improve on our limitations. Again this weekend we will have a few updates on the car and hopefully that will help us to make a step forward and to keep working. I__e been at the factory as well in the past few days and it__ really exciting to see how much the team is motivated and how hard they're working. So we're all aligned on where we need to improve and that's what we're trying to do. Yeah, I mean that's a good question actually. This weekend is going to be emotionally and mentally draining _ home race in front of the Italian fans, and as I said, my family and friends will be attending. So it__ going to be really important to manage the energy, especially in those moments where I can, and not waste energy on things that are not useful. It's going to be important to stay on top of that because it's really easy to hit the bottom of the pack before the end of the weekend. Already a normal weekend is very tiring and draining, so this is like double. Of course I'm going to try to protect myself. The fact that I__e got really good people around me really helps. We're all aligned that this weekend is going to be tough. We're preparing and I think we're quite well prepared. At the end of the day, it__ another race weekend, but because of the circumstances it's going to be different. At the same time, it's going to be really exciting. I think the energy is going to be amazing and that can be used to do even better on track. Really looking forward to see how we go this weekend. Well, I think _ you know, maybe you guys cannot see _ but I think it says a lot about how Lewis is as a person. I could see a lot of the human side of Lewis, not only the driver. Reading the message, it fulfilled my heart to receive such a message from such a figure in the sport. He has done so much and he__ still right there giving his best. He__ one of the best in history. To receive such a message is amazing. It also contained some advice, and I use it as motivation as well to go out there and do my best _ because it doesn't happen every day. Yeah, it's actually on my wall. I'll keep it there. The message is so nice that I just want to leave it there. Every time I enter the room, I can see it. It's a really good reminder. Well, I'm not able to attend school, but I'm trying to study as much as I can, especially in those little moments I have free. I'm getting help from the school as well to try and catch up because I__e definitely missed a lot of work during this time. But it__ not easy, because that also takes energy and effort. Especially ahead of such an important weekend, it__ really important to manage that side, not to do too much in order to save energy. But yeah, whenever I'm home or have a bit of time off, I try to do a little bit just to keep active and catch up as much as possible. Yeah, I organised this _ thanks also to some people at Mercedes. Rosa [Herrera Venegas], who__ in the room as well, helped. We were able to organise this for the school. I think it__ a good way for them to see with their own eyes this world. They used to watch the races on TV, but didn__ actually know what__ going on behind it. I think it__ a really good experience and I really hope they enjoy it. We__e organised some activities _ later on I__l show them the car and explain a bit, without going too much into detail. It__ a good way to keep the relationship because I don__ spend much time at home, so I don__ see them often. These little things can make the difference. About the race _ yeah, I would love for it to stay on the calendar. It's such a unique track. As I said before, it__ technical, it not easy, especially over one lap, to put everything together. It__ old school, quite bumpy. All things that make it special. The history of this track is incredible. Definitely I would love if there were the chance for the track to stay on the calendar next year and for the next few years of course. Well, that__ an interesting question. I think Miami was good because, for the first time this season, I felt like I could get up to speed with the track much quicker than I did in previous races. That__ something I__ looking to do more in the next few races, even at tracks I know. Being able to start off with the right pace and close to the limit can really help the rest of the weekend. One of my strengths in Miami was the fact that I could adapt well to the track, quickly. Weaknesses _ I wouldn__ really call it a weak point _ but something I__e been struggling with is being able to put the whole weekend together. As Liam said before, there are so many variables in F1, so many things you need to take into account. It__ really hard to put together the whole weekend consistently _ from FP1 all the way to the race. Every little detail can make such a difference, especially on the tyres. A few degrees in qualifying can be the difference between a good lap and not. Even in the race, if you push too much at the beginning, you can get massively penalised at the end of the sprint.
So something I__ trying to work on is having a better understanding and being able to put the whole weekend together. This year, so far, when I was doing a bad quali, the race was going well. But when I did a good quali, like in Miami, the race wasn__ as good. So that is the main point to work on at the moment. Yeah, I__ happy with how it came out in the end. I think it was a good experience to do, also because I could see with my own eyes a completely new world _ to see what goes on behind producing a movie. Of course, it was not a proper movie, but we could see how much work there was behind every scene. It was fascinating and a good experience. I__ super happy that people liked it. At the end of the day, it__ just to show how motorsport is, how tough it can be, and how much work it takes to get to the top level. For people who don__ really know the journey it takes to get to F1, I think it__ a good opportunity to have a better understanding. You start from very little in karting, then move up, and it doesn__ always work out _ for many reasons. You also have to be lucky, like in my case, to get such an opportunity. To get into an Academy first and then to drive in F1. I feel very lucky and very privileged to have had the opportunity back in 2018 when I was 11 and I got into the Academy, and then to get the seat for this year _ it shows you also need to be lucky, of course. But at the same time, results speak for themselves and performance does everything. I think it would be cool, but I don__ know how much it would cost to the Lego guys. Oh my God, yeah! It was so funny _ they told us we couldn__ bang wheels or anything, and of course, first corner... _And the thing was just going 20 kph _ if they actually make some faster ones... That would be interesting. Yeah, especially for the guy standing at the top _ it__ be quite a thing for him. Yeah, I mean it does feel real, definitely. It took me a little bit to realise this moment _ that for the first time, I will be racing in F1 at my home race. At the same time, it__ super exciting. As I said, the energy is going to be incredible, especially to see so many Italian fans. At the end of the session I__l have a proper look around and probably give a little wave to everyone because it__ so important to have such support. It can really help and motivate you to go on track and do even better. I could already feel, from the beginning of the year, so much support from Italians. It__ just growing even more. I__ super happy about that. I definitely couldn__ have asked for more. I think it would be really good to do a strong result also for all of them _ for everyone coming to the weekend and taking time out of their day to attend the race. It would be a good thing to do a strong weekend _ for myself, for the team, but also for them.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,Mercedes
Esteban Ocon,"I mean, a little bit of course. We prepare so much in the season in the simulator and obviously in the part of the team in Maranello. We were there on Tuesday, I was there at the wind tunnel in Maranello, so in a way it is a little bit a part of the team, the Italian DNA, which is very nice. I was able to spend a couple of days in Italy. It__ always special to come here. It__ a beautiful, historical track. I__e been coming to it for quite a long time now and yeah, it__ an enjoyable one to race on. I think we've improved a lot since Melbourne. We had a very difficult first race of the year where we were basically last on the grid. We've managed to turn the car around and to be a car that__ fighting for points every race. We__e had a couple of really good ones where we managed to maximise the potential. But it is very close out there and we need to continue to maximise that potential if we want to be scoring points. We__l have a couple of things on the car which are a little bit different this weekend, and hopefully that will help us to perform better than the other weeks. We got Q3 in Miami. Unfortunately, we came short of points, but we'll be fighting to get back into that zone again. Yeah, it will be the second time for me running that tyre. We ran it for the first time in Abu Dhabi testing, which is a very different track. I think this is going to open much more unknowns and uncertainty on a track we know quite well, which should be interesting. I__ looking forward to driving that and seeing how the degradation evolves _ if it opens up opportunities. No, no, no. I have the road version of the GR Yaris. Toyota is our partner with the team, and we got welcomed into their facility when we were in Japan. We were able to drive on the ""little N_rburgring"", as they call it, and test all their cars: the Supra Final Edition, the Yaris GR, Seb Ogier edition, Kalle Rovanpera _ the Corolla of Emperor... They were all there. We got to drive on gravel as well, which was mega. They have such a passion for motorsport and are very involved with us. I received the car recently at home, and it__ a car I__e always wanted to try. Now I__e got it at home, which is a dream come true. There are only 200 units in the world, and I got one, which is super special. I__ happy to share these things on my YouTube channel _ a project I__e wanted to do for a long time. There__ more stuff coming in the future. Unfortunately, not really any surprise from some of the decisions that have been taken recently by the team. I don__ have much to say. Obviously, sad for Jack. I__ sure he__l be back in F1 at some point. He showed some really strong moments this year where he qualified super well and he__ also been super quick in the car _ which was good to see. On the other hand, Franco also deserves to be in F1. Last year he showed some great things with the Williams car. Unfortunately, there are not enough cars on the grid to fit all the talents that are out there. But yeah, not much more to say. I__ happy where I am. I don__ think the repair is going to take too long. You just need to stick a few bits on the back. I asked the technical people, and they said they have in the pipeline to make a quicker version of it. This would be very interesting. That would be funny. We might need to wear helmets and seatbelts _ becomes an F1 race then! Honestly, it was the most fun I__e had in any driver__ parade. And I think for the fans it was awesome. Imagine that in Mexico, for example _ in the stadium. That would be epic.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,Haas
Liam Lawson,"Yeah, pretty happy. I think every weekend you get more comfortable and also coming to tracks that we__e been to before helps. Miami was a tricky one. But to be honest, I felt pretty comfortable in the car. I think we had good speed in the car, but there are a lot of variables in Formula 1. Just getting a whole weekend together has been quite tough recently. We__l try to do the best we can this week at a home race for the team. I think so. Honestly, I would say I never stopped doing that. It__ been a tricky year so far and there have been some really tough weekends, but personally I__e always felt comfortable driving the car. I feel as much as I__ still learning for sure, that hasn__ really changed. For this weekend, I__e been fortunate to test here in the past. It is a very intense track, quite hard, very old-school _ which for us drivers, we__e quite excited by. Yeah, I spoke to Jack. Obviously for him, it__ very tough. I think he showed enough to stay in Formula 1, for sure. He showed enough to be in Formula 1. But also, it__ hard _ how can you be expected in five races to show everything you have, especially in your rookie season? Unfortunately, it__ very cutthroat. But as Esteban said, I think he did enough _ even before F1, he did enough to deserve to be there. And he__ done enough in F1 to deserve to come back. But with 20 seats, it__ very, very tough. Every team makes their own decisions, so there__ not really much more to say. I felt really bad actually. Did you see how much time it took to build those cars? 22,000 hours. That__ true. Front wing and some wheels maybe! I don__ know what they were expecting! I thought it was awesome, honestly.",Emilia-Romagna,thursday,RB
George Russell,"Yeah, to be honest, really happy to come away with P3 because I've been struggling this weekend, personally, and always on the back foot. But ultimately, when it mattered, got a really good result today. But well done to the McLarens _ they're just down the road. No, it's not. But I was pretty calm and I felt really good with the car to keep him behind me, so it was good. I think Lando's a bit upset with me because we had a bit of a crash on the Lego race this morning. I gave him a bit of an injured leg, so I don't know if he's going to complain at me for something. Oh, without a doubt the race this morning _ the Lego race. That was awesome! We need to do that every race.",Miami,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Yeah, I mean it's never the best feeling but, you know, the team have done an amazing job, so I can't fault them at all. Good pit stops, great pace_ Yeah, we were up the road. So it was a good feeling. But Oscar drove well. Max put up a good fight as always, and I paid the price. But it is the way it is. What can I say? If I don't go for it, people complain. If I go for it, people complain. So, you can't win. But it's the way it is with Max _ it's crash or don't pass. Unless you get it really right and you put him in the perfect position, then you can just about get there. But I paid the price for not doing a good enough job today. But I'm still happy with second. Exactly, because that__ what I should do. It was good fun. It was enjoyable. I never wanted to let Oscar get too far out of my sights, but I had to put up a good challenge in the first quarter or third of the race trying to get past the Mercedes, trying to get past the Williams, trying to get past Max. So yeah, not an easy start for sure, but I made my way through reasonably quickly I think. And of course, the car was very strong today, so that definitely helps. It was fine. He__ fighting hard, but it__ up to him to do that. He__ ruining his own race. He__ not racing very smart. We probably could have finished 1-2 today, and he didn__ because of that. So yeah, he__ fighting, that is always expected, but that__ what it is. No. I gave it a good shot from when I got into second. There was a long way to go, I think 25, 30 laps almost at that point. I probably only stopped pushing the last 4-5 laps. The gap went from almost 10 to four or three, almost. I did all I could. I tried the whole race basically until the very end. I kept belief the whole race, but Oscar__ driving well. He__ quick. To catch from 10 seconds was always pretty much going to be impossible, but I gave it a good shot. I almost got there. Just not enough laps. Time will tell.",Miami,post-race,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I mean, I won the race that I really wanted to do. Yesterday was a tricky day. Obviously, the Sprint was what it was, but qualifying was probably one of my trickiest sessions of the year. And to come away with a win still on Sunday is an impressive result. So yeah, obviously there was a bit of argy-bargy at Turn 1 [inaudible]_ but we had a pace advantage, and clearly the car was unbelievable today. Yeah, I mean I think the first stint was really, really strong. Then the Hard stint, I was honestly struggling a little bit. So it was a good thing that I built that gap in the first stint. I think towards the end I started to get things a bit more back under control. But there__ still definitely some things to work on from this afternoon. So I__ very happy with the win, very happy with the points _ but constantly got to keep learning. So yeah, very, very happy to leave Miami on top. I mean, it__ just incredible the hard work that__ gone in. You know, remember two years ago here in Miami we were genuinely the slowest team _ I think we got lapped twice _ and to now have won the Grand Prix by over 35 seconds to third is an unbelievable result. And the hard work of every single person _ firstly the people here at the track, but everyone at the factory as well. I knew that was going to be the question! It was an attempt at a Griddy, as you can tell, poorly executed. I met Justin Jefferson on Thursday, who has essentially made the Griddy world famous, and stupidly made a bet with him that if I won the race, then I would do one for him. After qualifying yesterday, I didn__ practice because I thought that was definitely not going to be needed. So yeah, that was my first attempt at a Griddy live on world TV. I stayed true to the bet, but that__ the one and only time you__l be seeing me do that. I enjoyed it at certain points, yes. It was tough at the beginning trying to get past Max. I tried pretty hard to get past, with everything still on my car. It was not easy but I picked my moments when I needed to. I could tell that we had a lot of pace from the get-go today, and it was going to be a matter of when I got past, not if. But I wanted to do it as efficiently as I could because I knew once Lando got back behind me, he was going to be catching us a lot. I wanted to get through quickly but cleanly. I felt like I did a pretty good job of that, then built a gap. Maybe not the strongest second half of the race of my life, but I think building that gap and being quick at the right times was what I needed. I mean, to be honest with you, Kimi was very nice to me and didn__ make life very tough, which is nice when you race against people who identify when someone__ quicker and don__ make the race more difficult for both of us. So that was nice of him. Obviously, for Max, leading the race, a different story. But I knew to expect that. I could tell we had a lot of pace. Like I said, it was a matter of just biding my time, waiting for a moment, or forcing him into a moment. That__ what I was able to do. Once I got past, I knew I had to try and build a gap while Lando was behind him. That got me the win. Celebrations _ that__ definitely top of the list at the moment! I think this weekend was not my best, and a lot of that was yesterday. The race today was pretty solid, but yesterday I was pretty frustrated with my performance. Ultimately, yes, I won the race this weekend, but I think the likelihood of winning many races [after] qualifying fourth is pretty low. I did a lot of things right today, but there was definitely some good fortune there as well, and a very quick car. I don__ want to rely on that every single Sunday. Clearly, this is the exception to the pace we__e had this year. Yes, we__e always had a strong car, but the pace we had today from lap one it felt like was unexpected, even for us. I__l definitely take the performance and we__l try and work out how to do that every weekend, but there__ still definitely things to work on from a personal side and from a team point of view. Honestly, I don__ know. In qualifying we were not the quickest in the high-speed corners. I think generally in the low-speed corners is where we seemed quite good this weekend. In the race, all the corners become even slower, and looking after the tyres becomes more important. That__ probably been a strength of ours so far this year. This has been the first very hot race we__e had in terms of track temperature. Saudi was hot, but the track temperature today was the highest we__e had all year. I think that helped our pace. Both very different challenges, I would say. On days like today, our two cars were clearly the best in the field by some margin. I know how strong Lando is as a driver, being his teammate now for a couple of years. It__ never easy. But also, racing Max is never easy, as we saw. Both very different challenges. In the long term this season, it__ clearly going to be a strong fight between Lando and I, but both are challenging. Compared to two years ago, it__ an incredibly different place to be. The determination and the hard work has always been there. Even two years ago, we knew that things were in the pipeline to help us come back to the front. So while we got lapped twice that day in Miami two years ago, there was optimism and determination, still. Clearly, last year with Lando__ win, that was nice for the whole team in terms of finally having a car capable of winning a race again, on merit. There was obviously the 1-2 in Monza a few years ago, but Miami last season was the turning point in winning races because we could be the quickest on track. That__ an incredible place to be. Now, it__ a continuation of that. The determination and hard work are still identical, just the joy and the celebrations are a bit more frequent, which is nice. But we know we have a lot of competition. Being first now means we have less tunnel time, less development time. That__ something we__e enjoyed over our competitors for the last few years. So there are going to be challenges with being at the front, but it__ an incredible place to be. I don__ know. There are a lot of other smarter people than me who calculate when it__ time to switch to next year. Clearly, we do have a strong advantage at the moment, but not every weekend has looked like this. Saudi last weekend, our competition was very close, and we didn__ have it that comfortably. This weekend, a very different story, but I don__ expect every weekend to look like this. I think we have the advantage everywhere we go. Sometimes it__ a little, sometimes a lot. Clearly, in this position now, we have a lot of focus on next year. We want to make sure we win both championships this year and put ourselves in a good spot for next year. Yeah, we said that we__e trying to repeat 2007, so_ I don__ know. We clearly know that we have our strengths. It__ always been close between us. It__ going to be a good battle. There will be weekends where Lando is stronger, and weekends where I am stronger. We__e very aware of the fact that we want this success for as long as we__e at McLaren, which is a very long time for both of us. We__e aware there__ going to be a fight. We both want to become world champion, obviously. But we don__ just want one opportunity at this success. We want it for the next however many years, and that__ an important and an easy thing to keep in mind for us and the whole team. In some ways, yes. In some ways, no. We know pretty much exactly how one another drives. We know our strong points, maybe some of our weaker points. So from that side you have more information, but it goes both ways. We both know we__e got the same car, so that removes one factor. But there are other complications with having the same car. You can have the same strengths and weaknesses on track. With how difficult it is to follow cars, 9 times out of 10, whoever__ in front at the start is probably going to be in front at the end. So it__ difficult like that. Then there__ the pit strategies and whatever that become a factor when you__e in the same team. There are positives and negatives.",Miami,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it's been a great qualifying, I think we improved the car a tiny amount as well, which helped me to basically rotate it a bit better and honestly, you know Q1, Q2, Q3 just improving every run, really, trying to find a bit more the limit. I had a tiny moment on my final lap into Turn 1, so I lost a bit of time there. But around here it's just very complicated with the tyres over a lap, but at the end it worked out well so I'm very happy to be on pole. . I mean, you can back out of it, but it's qualifying, so you try to correct it and just floor it out of the corner. Yeah. Let's see. I mean, race pace, I don't know. We have to wait and see for the weather, but it's the best starting position _ that's always positive. And then in the race, of course, a whole different story, but of course we'll try to maximise everything we can. I think apart from entry to Turn 1, yes. But yeah, it's just been really tricky to get the tyres in the right window over a whole lap. So I think in hindsight_ Of course, you never want to have a little oversteer moment on entry, but over the whole lap I did feel a bit more comfortable. So yeah, of course, very happy to be in pole. I think every qualifying, like Q1, Q2, Q3, just kept on chipping away at it and just kept on improving a little bit. So that's exactly what you want. Just a little bit in 7_8 and then a little bit in the second sector. And then I think a tiny bit in the last corner maybe. So yeah, little bits everywhere. I mean, we are still struggling a little bit with our limitations in the car, but I do think that we've been quite decent over a lap, if you look at the cornering, we're a bit slow on the straight this week. Then I think especially McLaren and Mercedes, and they took a new engine and of course that always gives a little bit more power than a used engine. But yeah, it seems like it's a little bit better. Of course, the long run is a different story. The tyres get really hot around here. But of course tomorrow I don't know what will happen in terms of rain or not, how warm it will be. To be honest, the colder it is I think the better. I don't know, to be honest. No one has really done any proper long running because of also the Sprint race being wet mainly. So yeah, I just try to do the best I can to manage my tyres to what the car can do, and then we'll see what that will bring us. It's good. I mean, coming into the weekend I knew that this was not our strongest track with all the low speed, but actually I think when you look at the data it's probably not even most of our problem around the lap. So I guess that is already a positive. Yeah, all of it. Yeah, we need to make less mistakes and we need to find more performance. I think it's quite straightforward. It's just not easy to extract or find. You know, that's how it is. But we keep pushing, keep trying to bring bits to the car to make it faster. Just changed the setup a bit from before to now__hat's why it rotated a bit better. What we are trying to achieve of course is a better balance in the car. Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something because it's just a really weird layout I would say. So it takes a bit more time. But for sure it was not negative. And yeah, from here we can work and try to improve it further because from my feeling, of course, we're not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight. It's been good to be able to spend a few days at home before coming here. When she's just born, you want to make sure everything is OK. Clearly it didn't make me slower as well, being a dad. So that's the positive. We can throw that out of the window as well for people mentioning it. And yeah, when I was here, honestly, yeah, just quite fluent. Anyway, I'm in contact a lot with my girlfriend throughout the day. So, you know, getting pictures and FaceTime a bit. It's always there. But now one more member in the family. I'm not surprised. But again, when you just start in Formula 1, there's so much to learn and to already be at this pace is very impressive. But I'm not surprised at the same time. He__l only get better, to be honest. It's as simple as that. Yeah, I don__ really listen to these kind of silly things. Just do my thing. I think there are enough racing drivers in the past that have been World Champion even after having kids, you know? So I don't even know where that comes from.",Miami,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah. No, hat__ off to Max, especially being a dad now. I was hoping he was going to slow down a little bit, but it clearly didn't. So no, I'm happy with today. I'm happy with the progress I've been making with the car, with myself. So no, Max did a Max lap once again and I can't fault him. So happy and yeah, excited for tomorrow. I did. Yeah. Yeah. I think even that lap, well, it__ all __oulda, shoulda, woulda_ stuff, you know. But I didn't deliver. But yeah, no, I mean the pace was there. The car has been feeling good. I've been feeling better than I have done over the last few weekends. I've still not put it together, but it is what it is. Max on pole and P2, so yeah, ready to see what we can do into Turn 1. I was. So let's pray for that. You know, I don't really mind if it's going to be dry or wet, but Miami seems to be surprising quite a bit with the weather at the minute. So I'm ready for both. Yes, I can. Yep. You got it right. Yeah. I just didn't quite put it together, but that's it. Very. I mean, I'm very happy with the end result. Just a shame when you miss out on pole, so that's the only frustrating bit. But I think I've been trying different things, I've been doing different things with the team to try and work a bit more in this area and things have been taking a step forward. So I'm happy. Maybe not quite there yet, but happy with the progress. Yeah, I would say so. I mean, the DRS helps a lot around here with the overtaking. It's what you need. You also have some much bigger braking zones than you have in Suzuka, so I hope so anyway. I hope that's the case and we can have a good race tomorrow. But I don't just expect competition from Max. Kimi's been quick all weekend and Oscar has been as well. So yeah, I just expect a tough race from all accounts. Impossible to know, you know, what car he's got compared to us. The advantage we have is two quick drivers and they don__, or we have a car that's capable of allowing drivers to drive it quicker. But yeah, impossible to know, impossible to actually know the difference between the two cars. Thursday afternoon? Why Thursday? What__ the problem then! I don't know. I'm working on things I keep to myself. I think I've fed his ego enough! I mean, similar thing. He's in Formula 1 for a reason. Everything else he did in his car racing career has been very strong. He's got a very good team-mate that beat Lewis over the last couple of years. So if he's now able to beat that team-mate, being George, then he's clearly doing a very good job.",Miami,post-qualifying,McLaren
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, I mean, this weekend is going well so far. Was a bit disappointing this morning, but it was good to bounce back this way and yeah, I struggled a little bit during the quali. I didn't have such a clean run like I had yesterday. But yeah, that last lap was quite good. I was a bit too greedy in Turn 1 starting the lap, but the rest of the lap was quite good, so I'm happy with it. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely... the gaps are super tight and definitely, you know, if you can gain just few hundredths, you can make up so many places. So it's really about putting everything together. And so far this weekend, I'm doing that and yeah, hopefully tomorrow we can have a good race. It was quite OK. I struggled a little bit during the qualifying. I felt like I didn't have such a clean run as yesterday__ Sprint Quali. I struggled more today to put the tyre in the right window and to extract the best out of it during the whole lap. I think the last lap was a bit better on that side, still not amazing, but really happy with the result. Definitely. I mean, every weekend is learning and experience and more confidence with the car as well. So really, really happy with how every weekend I'm more able to play a lot more with the car and trying to explore the limit as well. So far this weekend I felt really good in the car. So that's definitely a positive. And hopefully tomorrow we can do a good race. I don't really want to say because it always goes terribly wrong! So I'm just going try to have a good start and then try to set a good pace and stay with Max and Lando. It's not going to be easy of course, but we'll see , first of all, how's the weather, because there are some thunderstorms probably, so that might not be really nice. But yeah, let's just see how the weather is going to be and then we'll try to do our best with what we have. Definitely also in FP1 we did quite a long run, so we were able to collect good data on the dry and hopefully we can have a good pace in the race. Well, I don't know. I did FP1 and I felt good and I was able to push the car more to the limit. I think that is down a lot to also experience and confidence. I think also having a week break after a triple-header was really helpful as well for myself to gather all the information. So definitely a lot of experience, also understanding how to extract more out of the tyre during the whole lap__omething I haven__ been doing well during the season. There's still room for improvement, but yeah, I feel better and better in the car every weekend. So hopefully after this weekend, we're going to European tracks, tracks that I know well, and hopefully I can maintain the same pace or even go faster. Too kind! Well, I mean it was very on the limit, to be honest. My second phase on the start was not good. I broke traction, so that allowed Oscar to come alongside. Then obviously I started turning because the corner was there, and probably we were both on the limit on braking and eventually we touched and then I went wide and lost many places. But yeah, definitely tomorrow it's going to be a bit of a different story because I'm starting second row. Definitely a lot learned from that start.",Miami,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"How you doing, Miami? The crowd's been so great today. Oh man, I'm so happy with that. You know, it's been a tough year so far, but to have_ You know, I never thought it was going to rain in Miami. It was the first time they've all been on track in the wet here. And what a race it provided us. So, big thank you everybody. I really, really did struggle on the Inters. I think everyone was struggling on them and I just__ made that call at the end. I was like, I'm coming in because I was not__ wasn't going nowhere. So take the risk, take the gamble, and it paid off. Wish we had another couple of laps to give these guys a bit of a fight, but, you know__ut congrats to McLaren as always. Well, I don't think I was a front runner, was I? I was like sixth or something! No, so happy. Really, really happy with the result to get up here, because it wasn__ looking very good through_ Qualifying, obviously, we were quite a chunk off these guys and then getting onto the Inters I was just sliding around. You know, I had the Williams behind me, I think, and there was another one behind him who was most likely I was going to be overtaken by. So I was like, I got to roll the dice. I was full lock through Turn 12 and full lock through Turn 16 and it still wasn__ turning. So I was like, let's just go for it. If I__ honest, I should have done it maybe a lap or two before that. I think it would have been probably the same result because these guys were a bit too far ahead. But really happy to get back up there and get the points. You know, when we all went out for the formation lap, I don't know how it was... obviously Charles had that moment. I had exactly the same moment _ I was right behind him _ and somehow it just stopped going towards the wall, right at the last moment. So that was nearly both of us out. So, as I said, to come from that to then get these points, I'm really grateful. It's really difficult to say, honestly. I think the fact is, so far we're not extracting everything. I don__ think we're extracting everything from the car, and that's what we need to work on _ to extract the full potential of the car. I think we have good downforce. I don't think we're on the same pace as the McLarens, but I think we should be fighting a little bit closer, perhaps to the Bulls and McLaren (sic, Mercedes). So I think there__ a lot of elements that we need to elevate, and hopefully we__l try and see if we can do that into qualifying today. Definitely lots learned already so far. And yeah, now it's just switching our mind to the next session. Yeah, every moment counts. And I think it__ definitely been not so great, obviously, since China, but looking at it, you can definitely see perhaps why we've been in the position that we're in. I think coming into this weekend, we've made some changes, but we have more to do in order to be fighting more consistently at the front. So we just need to knuckle down. I do believe that we can get some better results. So I'm hoping I can get the car in a better place today or this afternoon. Yeah. You know I posted because it made me_ Last night, I saw the video of Bono and Kimi and Toto, and it genuinely just brought warmth to my heart, because, honestly, I__e been in that team for a long, long time. Bono is just the best. And I know there was a lot of question around whether or not to take on a more experienced driver. And to then just continue on and continue to work hard and get a pole _ it kind of silences all the critics. And I love to see that in an underdog. Such a great story. I think, as I've not seen the race start_ It was the trickiest of conditions. We haven't had any running in the rain here. So that was definitely a very, very tough scenario. Also to have the two fastest right beside you is going to be very tough, always. So I don't really know. I think I heard you say it__ close to Turn 1. I would just say to continue doing what he__ doing. I think he knows what he's doing, and just continue to enjoy it.",Miami,post-sprint,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, definitely. I feel like I did pretty much everything right there. So yeah, obviously a bit disappointed to come away with second, but that's how it goes sometimes. Unfortunately, racing's a pretty cruel business. So yeah, hopefully that means I got a bit of luck for this afternoon and tomorrow. But no, another great start and had to get my elbows out on that one, so happy with what I did. Yeah, definitely. I think we had a little bit of pace on the table in Sprint qualifying yesterday and hopefully we can use that for quali this afternoon. Would be nice if the weather could make up its mind, but, you know, been enjoying it. And yeah, I think we've got a quick car underneath, so we'll try and make it even quicker and have a bit of an easier race tomorrow. I waited for it to dry up and then put dry tyres on. It was pretty much as simple as that. I was tempted to go the lap before, but we were going to come out in a bunch of traffic and with one dry line, that__ not a very nice position to be in. So we went a lap later because, I mean, we were miles ahead of the cars behind, so we didn't really have to risk it. And yeah, it was clearly the right time for slicks. You know, just the timing of the Safety Car was not in our favour, but there__ not much we could have done. No. Even the lap I pitted, I was more than ready to. Again, without the traffic the lap before, I was very comfortable to pit one lap earlier than we did. So to try and do another five, six laps on an Inter _ you would have had slicks by the end, but not because you pitted, because your Inters were completely destroyed. Yeah, I had a really good start. Obviously got alongside. I think we probably both braked a little bit later than we should have. And yeah, I mean, there was a bit of contact, but I pulled it up still pretty comfortably. And yep, I think with that move, it would have won me the Sprint if there was no Safety Car, so I think it was a good first lap. I've been happy with it, yes. I think there was a bit left on the table yesterday in Sprint quali, so I'll try and tidy that up. But yeah, the car's been performing well. I think even in the wet conditions today, it seemed fast. So I don't think we'll reinvent the wheel, but of course we__l try and find a little bit more time if we can. I mean, the reaction when the Safety Car came out was __ot again_. But yeah, there's not much you can do in that circumstance. I knew I had a pretty comfortable gap behind, so I wasn__ taking too many risks. I could see that I was a little bit faster than Lando. So I thought I had that one pretty much under control once we pitted. And then, yeah, obviously the timing of the Safety Car was unfortunate. But frustrating in the moment. I think I'm leaving that Sprint knowing that I did everything I could, and everything that was in my control was well executed. And that's all I can ask for.",Miami,post-sprint,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, I mean, my luck in Miami seems pretty good at the minute, so I'm happy. But you know, the pace was still very good. It's always just difficult, these races. You never know when to box. You box early__ou know, it paid off for Lewis and he had a good strategy__r do you stay out later and maybe get the Safety Car, you know? So it__ worked two years in a row. I probably would prefer if this happened tomorrow rather than today, but I__l take it. I__ happy. Good job by the team, so yeah, it was good fun. That__ the plan. Yeah, that__ the plan. But it__ tricky. You know, there__ a lot of quick guys out there and I felt good yesterday, to be honest. A couple little mistakes, but I__ ready to go again. So excited. It was a good race. I mean, everything went to plan, you know. Both had a good start and got into first and second, which was a nice thing. And then, yeah, it was those conditions that we've had several times this year already, where it's Inters, drying out. But I had good pace throughout. I managed things well. I had mainly good pace at the end of the stint. And obviously, then it dried out enough to go onto the slicks. I had to box a lap later. I probably wanted to box the lap Oscar did, but I was unable to do that. So just getting forced to stay out helped me get the win. No, I was too close. I would have lost out to the others. I don't know what I'm going to say. It was just the tyres were degrading a lot the last few laps. It was pretty much dry for the most part, apart from the chicane section. But I think I just kept my tyres in a maybe slightly better condition and still had good pace. Obviously, then I had to do one more lap where I could push in the clean air and it was a strong lap again. So, no, just good management, good pace throughout. The car was feeling very good, so I was happy. Probably not. I mean, I think I've been pretty happy with the car all weekend. We put it down in a good place. No, excited. I was happy yesterday with the P3. It was close between a lot of people. So yeah, satisfied with that. Obviously happy with today and confident for later today. Yeah, I mean, well obviously it was the first lap I had some clean air, so that made things feel quite a bit better. I think my pace was still very strong at that phase. You know, I feel like I could push on. And a little part of me wanted to keep going and kind of stay on the tyre. And it was only four laps to go, but the slick was a lot better. Like we saw, Lewis already gained a lot of time on the other guys _ maybe their first laps were not amazing _ but I think Oscar was still probably a second or two seconds quicker. So I'm sure he still would have come out ahead, and I would have come out on the colder tyres. So no, I probably wasn__ so looking ahead to where Oscar was at that point. It was more looking behind to the guys who might have been trying to undercut and get ahead on the slick tyre. I just put in a very good lap. We made a very late call to box _ it was only literally the last corner. But yeah, worked out, so I was happy. I mean, they've been good. Like I said on Thursday, it's not like I__e lacked confidence or anything. I'm still happy. I still know my pace is there and the speed is there. But of course it's a boost, you know. Every little thing, every point is a good thing. Even yesterday when I was third, I was so happy with the lap. I did a couple of little mistakes, but it was still a well-executed lap. Just kind of getting the lap in and putting it there and at least being in the fight. I think a couple of my other mistakes have just set me further back. But this weekend has been a good one. Yeah, I've been happy with everything _ with the car, with myself, with the performances. So just keep chipping away.",Miami,post-sprint,McLaren
Lando Norris,"No, but it's good memories, right? It's stuff I dreamed of as a kid _ winning and standing on the top step _ and I managed to do it here, which was a cool place to do it. So just good memories, good times. Thinking back to the race, chequered flag, seeing the team celebrations _ a lot of things that always bring a smile to my face. So hopefully the plan is to try and do it again. Same as normal, I guess _ other competition. We feel good and confident we're the best, but the others are certainly not far behind and are consistently putting pressure on us. One little mistake and we're behind and not where we want to be. Otherwise, it's just another weekend where we're trying to improve. I__ sure others are trying to improve and try and get ahead of us, but yeah, just making sure I have a good, clean weekend. I'm working on my things, what to improve, and trying to figure out all the things behind the scenes on what I need to do better on. It's certainly not because of a lack of speed or ability to do so. I've often led the way in Q1 and Q2, but always when I've got to Q3, then it's not gone to plan. So yeah, there's stuff from the driving side and from the car side, where things haven't clicked. But I'm working on it and hopefully this weekend I can put it into practice. I certainly think it will help. I honestly don__ know the exact timeline of things. There__ also a mixture of things that will slowly come and be implemented over time. But I also don__ want to rely on that myself. There are things I__ working on separately, and hopefully that__ a better fix than waiting for other bits to come. But it__ good we__e working as a team and trying to understand these things. It__ been clear that there have been differences from last year in how the car works, how it acts, and how I__ able to get lap time out of it and perform. So, a mixture of things. I have to be a little patient with some things _ some are bigger than others _ but it takes time. So I just keep my head down and keep pushing myself. No, no. This is the nice thing. You see a lot of what people say and what they speculate, but no, I'm confident not much at all has to change for us and we can keep doing what we're doing. So like Oscar said before, I think we'll be strong through the whole season. I'm confident of that. We have plenty of things we want to improve and do even better on, but others can say what they want and think what they want. I don't mind. Yep. It's a difficult one to answer. Yeah, it's very difficult to answer. I think there are just certain things which don't allow me to feel what I need to feel and those things are what allow me to drive to the level that I can drive at__o get pole positions and to drive at the highest level in racing. We're talking about small things. It's not like it's impossible to drive all of a sudden. It's just when we're talking about qualifying split by hundredths of a second, thousandths of a second, that's what I'm complaining of and nothing more than that. Yeah, it's not one I can probably just give you a yes or no answer to. I think he's maybe more naturally able to adapt. And I also think it's a driver__ job to adapt to whatever car they get given, but there are compromises, and the team are also there to try and help you get the most out of the car. But it's clear there have been some changes and whether it's just suited Oscar or Oscar__ way, or him doing a better job at adapting, that's not for me to kind of know or try and figure out or waste my time on. But yeah, for me, it's also hurt me a little bit more and I've not been able to perform at the level that I was at the end of last season, which I think is the best level that I've been. No, I don't think so. I mean, it's very hard to know. Of course we have the simulator and things, and there was nothing that really spoke out that much about it. So the answer is no. We knew it would be a step forward, we knew it would be quicker, but until you really put it on the track and you drive at different circuits_ You know, it's not just that one. There are some circuits I felt better and some circuits I__e liked the feeling a lot. But not enough of an indication for me to kind of prepare__robably what I needed to prepare for. Yeah, I mean the break was very well needed for everyone, but definitely myself. It was nice to get away from things and have a bit of a reset. But it was a productive, I would say, couple of weeks. That doesn't mean a lot of stuff has changed for this weekend. It's not like things are going to magically work as I would love, but I think there's been a lot more understanding over the last couple of weeks of certain things, certain feelings, what could have affected things and what maybe didn't. So, you know, the majority of my sim work was based upon that and trying to understand some of these things, which is good. But then it's about understanding them further, knowing what measures you can take to stop changing things on the car and what you want to put resource into. So it's a bigger thing than just saying this or that. But yeah, there's been a lot more understanding and I think that's the main thing. So as a team then we need to work on how we can bring that to the car. I don't remember. I mean, Miami is a great place. Of course, it's a lot of fun. I think for me personally, I just have a lot of friends who are here. So I came out on Sunday and spent a few days here. But it's not only a good event, it's busy. Like we've said, with Patrick and those guys coming, we have a lot of stars and other athletes and celebrities, which is always cool. I always like that kind of thing. The one thing is just the traffic. The traffic__ terrible. Is it worse than Mexico? It might be, because in Mexico there's kind of no roads. Here I've never seen so many roads, yet there__ still so much traffic. So that__ the only thing I would probably change. But otherwise, it's a nice place. There__ a lot of lovely people and I enjoy it a lot. No, not worried at all. He__ doing a good job and he deserves it. Nothing more than that. I don__ believe so much in the momentum stuff _ that__ just my opinion. I__ doing what I can. I__e clearly made some mistakes and not at the level I need to be, but I believe I can be at that level soon enough. So no reason to be worried. It__ round six of 24. I__ not going to say that forever, but I know I need to get a move on and get into gear a little bit. I__ doing the best I can every weekend at the minute, trying to improve. But the speed is there, the pace is there, the race pace is definitely there. It__ just one thing I need to tidy up. It__ a difficult thing, but I__ confident I__l get it. I think for the majority it__ been a natural evolution. The team has still improved a lot, even since last year, in terms of how we work _ the car has improved, the obvious things have improved _ but the way the team performs has improved quite a good amount and that has to continue. That__ the main thing _ when you get to the top, there__ no time to relax. And that__ all because of the scrutiny of other people talking and claiming things and coming up with bizarre stuff at times. So it__ more about dealing with the scrutiny. The team has to be even more precise with things, not make mistakes or do any silly little things. For the majority, it__ the same guys and girls all doing their job and trying to get the most out of the car. It__ more the external stuff that changes, but that__ out of your control. They__e doing a very good job of dealing with that and carrying on with what they__e got. It__ great. Obviously, there__ a good atmosphere because it__ the best start to a season McLaren have had for many, many years. For a lot of people back at MTC, it__ a dream start _ we__e winning races. That__ what we__e here to do and to achieve. To lead both championships is our goal. It__ a great atmosphere, but the main thing is everyone__ still working together very well. There__ determination for this year but also a lot of focus on next year and making sure we don__ relax or get complacent. But also that we know why we are doing well. Which I think is very important. It__ not like we__e lucked into the position we are in now. We understand our strengths, weaknesses, where our threats come from _ all of those things. The team is very competent at the minute and that__ a very good position to be in. With some leaders, like Zak and Andrea, who keep the team on their toes, with working hard, looking ahead to the future, and reminding us of our competition and how close they can be. And the fact that we didn__ win all the races so far _ we__e not happy about that. It__ a very good spirit in the team. Same with Oscar _ we__e both getting along, enjoy working together. I push him, he pushes me, and that__ good for the team. So yeah, all positive things.",Miami,thursday,McLaren
Pierre Gasly,"Yeah, we've got some big names coming. We have a lot of American support and investors in the team, so coming here is always a special moment. Patrick is going to be around this weekend. I must say I admire his work, his success in his sport, and it's always a special time to be able to chat with him. I think it's extremely tight in the field, especially from the sort of position we're fighting in. Within three tenths you could be in Q3 or knocked out in Q1. So it's just difficult. I think we've been able to really put things together the last two events. We__e not been very fortunate in the first three races. But I do feel we've got the speed to fight the Williams, AlphaTauri (sic) are very competitive at time, also Haas. So we__e just got to be on top of our game and extract every hundredth and millisecond of our package, and I'm sure we'll be able to fight for those. Well, I think, yeah, for sure it brings a bit more unknown coming this year also with a Sprint weekend. It doesn't make things very easy in terms of tyre allocation and what way you want to go, so there are probably going to be compromises to be taken at some stage throughout the weekend. But yeah, I think we might see slightly more differences across strategy, definitely for Sunday. But I'm sure we'll learn more about it also Saturday, once we__e done the sprint race. You get a police escort, what are you complaining about! On my side, I must say I love everything about it. Miami is a cool city. It's always got great energy in town and I love the fact that it's one of those races with the time difference, you kind of get to come slightly earlier. So you get to spend some time__uesday, Wednesday gets quite busy__ut I still find myself having a night out and going to some nice restaurants. You kind of feel the vibe of Miami, which is quite different to what we're used to back in Europe. So yeah, it's one of these very, very cool places. And you know, I kind of envy Lando for getting his first race win here, because I'm sure Sunday night was definitely a cool one and one he's going to remember. So yeah, it's one of those races__ou want the Sunday to go well so you get a good reason to party on Sunday night.",Miami,thursday,Alpine
Yuki Tsunoda,"Yeah, I experienced the classic British weather _ started damp and we didn__ bring any wet tyres, just because we didn__ want to waste any mileage for the driver TPC test. So we waited quite a long time for it to dry up. Unfortunately, we got a bit of an issue at the end of the day as well. So in the end, we didn__ drive much, but still a cool experience. To be honest, it__ hard to feel the difference, right? It was completely different conditions and completely different corner characteristics compared to previous races that I__e raced. Also, I didn__ want to give stupid feedback to make confusion, so I told them what I felt clearly, but otherwise, still a good test for me to get some mileage. It just needs more time, I guess, to get used to it fully. I__ happy with the progress so far. The confidence is quite there, but just when you push 100% on the limit in qualifying, that__ where you kind of face it for the first time, right? Because you don__ push 100% until then. The starting point is always slightly below where I want to be or where I used to start with in FP1, so it takes a bit more time to build up on new tracks. In qualifying, most of the time so far I experience new behaviour from the car and I__ not always able to cope with it. I wouldn__ say the car is super difficult _ it just needs more time to define where the limit is. I__l say it__ not complicated in the sense of trying to drive around, but it__ still not easy, for sure. In VCARB the car was a bit more lenient and forgiving with any directions. The Red Bull has a sharper, narrower window where it performs. It__ not easier than VCARB, but better than I thought initially when I jump into Red Bull. This is the first time after joining Formula 1 [that I__ in a different car]. For four years I drove the same car and knew how to set it up and where the limit was. Now, I just naturally didn__ have to think about it before, but now, in terms of set-ups_ The set-up I tried a couple of time in Suzuka that I thought would be good, just didn__ work out _ even when in the car, the balance felt good, the lap time didn__ reflect it. So that needs to come from experience, and sometimes you just have to accept the difficulties of the car. Like, if it feels like a lot of understeer or oversteer, but lap time is good, probably stick to that direction. It__ a different approach. I__ learning as much as possible. The team is helping a lot with those direction. I just have to get used to it. But the limit, I just still don__ know yet exactly. Like in Q3 in Saudi, I pushed a bit more and had a massive snap, which I didn__ expect. It will get there. I just try to keep my head down and slowly build up. Even with the general environment [within the team], me and my engineer _ he__ Scottish, so a mix of Scottish English and my Japanese English _ it__ a bit interesting. Those things just need more time to blend in. Well, is it the track or just_ The food is good! I'm happy in general, I guess. There's not much. I mean, traffic is a bit of a topic.. Luckily this year__ntil last year it was a bit different! So far no complaints, I guess. Yeah, it's good. Maybe like just naturally. Maybe in terms of limits _ those things just naturally come into my brain and muscle memory. So once I hit the track in Miami, probably it will feels maybe different. But so far in terms of understanding about the set-up _ because it was just really, really limited time _ we wanted to do lots of changes to the set-up but just couldn__ manage to finish those. It finished more towards the engineering side _ what they wanted to try. So to be honest, maybe in terms of car set-up, not really. But hopefully I have a lot of movements going on with the car and I__ not always there _ I__ just there. Hopefully that gives us slightly better confidence into this Miami Grand Prix. No, I haven__, and so far I__ not planning to. I think I__e been enough in the UK. I don__ think there__ much benefit. I have more benefits living in Italy rather than_ yeah. I mean, healthy, living next to him. Yeah. I just feel, you know, like_ unfortunately, when I was living in Milton Keynes, it was during quarantine, so I didn__ have the best time in the UK. That didn__ help for sure. But with this kind of Formula 1 schedule, when you have downtime, it__ very important that you have a house where you can be comfortable with in order to reset your mind. So far, Italy is allowing me to reset and I feel very comfortable. I__ happy with Italy. I__ happy to go to Milton Keynes for simulator sessions or whatever. Yeah, definitely. To be completely honest, the last few races, I wasn__ able to put it all together in Q3. I built up more through Q1 and Q2, and Q3 is certainly more of a push. But if you push slightly more than the car can handle _ even 2% more than what the car wants _ it just reacts super differently to what I used to be used to. So far, I can__ really predict it yet. That will come with experience in the Red Bull. Hopefully it__l naturally come. I definitely haven__ been able to extract the performance in Q3. It__ something I need to work on. If I can qualify higher, there__ a better chance to score points. You can be more flexible with the team on strategy. So yeah, definitely a priority area to work on.",Miami,thursday,Red Bull
Nico H_lkenberg,"Well, I hope not and I hope that we can shift the limit up as the season goes on. Yes, it's true, the last couple of races, it's been difficult. On some tracks we were a bit more competitive than others. I think Jeddah in particular, I feel in quali we didn__ maximise the potential and in the race we simply weren't competitive enough. So like I said, I feel it's a little track dependent and anyway, in the midfield it__ so tight that you have to be perfect on the execution every time to get something meaningful. So yeah, that's where we are. I think we are aware that we still have a lot of work ahead of us, but we're not that far away either. Not necessarily. I wouldn't say that. Maybe from what we've seen so far, actually a bit more the low and medium speed, which obviously here has a little bit more content of that. But yeah, we'll find out, and you know, temperatures and conditions always play a role. I think it's very important still to build momentum this year. Everything we do now somewhat matters next year. Of course, different set of regulations, but we have to push on parallel. I'm sure that__ what everyone is doing, especially the big teams. But I still want to see some progress this year and we want to score more points. Long year, we're still pretty early in the season, so still a lot to play for. Well, I think these guys are fighting for the championship, you know, that__ what it looks like right now, and probably that will continue like this. So there are no gifts when you fight for a championship, and in racing in general. It__ lap one action, Turn 1 _ you come in with quite high speed even though it's not the longest of runs. So for me personally, I think it's part of racing and these kind of things just happen. You know that for a fact? I don't know. Yeah, it's true _ it was a fun fact that I was the only one since Checo and K-Mag left at the end of last year, I was the only dad. So yeah, he__ joining that club. I hope it__ a good sleeper. We__e been quite fortunate and lucky. But yeah, I think there's lots to discover _ many beautiful, nice things that come with that. So yeah, I'm sure he'll enjoy it. I mean, judge for yourself _ look at the stats and what happens. Everyone is obviously different, but personally, I don't feel that's the case. I feel once we step in the car _ visor down, go out _ even for me, I tend to forget what goes on outside because we're just so focused and so driven to perform and maximise. I just personally feel it's added benefit because it__ giving me so much outside of work and outside of being in Formula 1. So I would even say it__ kind of been helpful for me, if anything. Yeah, I like it here personally too. Like George said, it__ a bit different. And you personally raised that time _ 4 PM _ I think it's more an FIA a subject but it's a little late for me personally. And traffic is definitely a topic here. And unfortunately this year, apparently the Grand Prix cut the police escort budget. So that's going to be a bit of a _ it would be nice to have that back for next year, please.",Miami,thursday,Sauber
George Russell,"No, I think it's probably better than our pre-season expectations, to be honest. The pace has fallen out where we thought _ that step behind McLaren and then a close fight with Red Bull and Ferrari. We've been doing really well to get those podiums, but I don't think it necessarily means we are the second fastest team. I think sort of on average we__e the third fastest team. We saw Charles had a great race last week and obviously Max the last couple of races, but we've just been nicely consistent and picking up points. Tyres were too hot, really. That was a big problem. I think just pushing a bit too hard to try and keep up with the front two. Charles put in a really strong race. I was probably driving too quick for what the tyres and the car were capable of, and then we dropped off a cliff. Not too sure how this weekend__ going to pan out because in terms of temperatures and tyres, it'll be relatively similar to Jeddah. We'll have to wait and see and see if any of the learnings we've taken from last week translate into a bit of performance. I__ confident the quali pace will be there or thereabouts, but the race pace _ there__ a bit more of a question mark. Yeah. Conceptually, yes. But obviously we want to see these things put into action rather than saying ""we're considering things"" _ you know, we all consider a lot of things. We__e clear we want changes and once they are implemented then we__l comment. But for the time being, it__ being considered. So those words don__ mean anything until the change has been made. Yep. Yeah, I think we__e all professionals, but this is a personal part of your life. I guess for anyone who's had a kid, it__ a pretty special moment. So yeah, all the best to him. As Nico says, I think for many people it probably brings things to your life. I know what it's like when I see my nieces and nephews _ they're not my kids, but they bring me so much joy when I spend time with them. And you've seen drivers in the past win championships and races who__e got kids, so I don't see it changing anything on his professional level. I mean, in short, yes. I mean, collectively we've not spoken any further since the open letter that was sent out. So whether that is the response _ I'm not too sure. As I said, it__l be great if changes were made and the drivers were at least heard. I think it's just in the best interest for the sport and ensuring that some common sense is applied to these situations. As I said, I think all of us, we can comment on it when we see the action being taken rather than just the consideration. Yeah. I mean, I feel fortunate that I__e had the chance to run with the cooling vest. It__ not perfect yet, but it__ definitely an improvement, I feel. Every car is also different _ I think every cockpit runs at different temperatures. I know we've seen our cockpit getting up to 60 degrees before, and I think the heat hazard is at 31 degrees, I believe, or 30. But when you compound that with the sunlight and the temperature of the cockpit, it is like a sauna in the race car. So yeah, I don__ know. We've not collectively spoken about it, and not everybody's in favour to run it _ which is also fine. Somebody made the point recently _ like football players on a cold day, some people are wearing gloves, some people have got short sleeve shirts on _ and that should be the driver__ choice. Maybe the heat hazard should be reduced slightly because we've not yet gone over it. Saudi was hot, Bahrain was hot, here _ maybe it could be adjusted by a few degrees. Yeah. I mean, I enjoy coming to Miami. It__ a crazy race. The circuit is quirky. That tight section _ we don__ love it, but it's different. You know, the same like in Baku _ we don__ love the castle section, it__ so tight and very challenging, but you don__ want every circuit to be the same either. It__ an amazing race. It's improving every year. Things are looking better as well _ driving to the paddock, it looks pretty cool. And where all of the team garages are set up inside the stadium _ they__e the experts, we just drive the cars. It should stay like that. I mean, it___ I feel it's like unprecedented times we__e been in over the last 18 months with what__ been changed and what__ happening. I think when the GPDA was founded years ago, it wasn__ really to talk about politics _ it was to talk about safety, improvements of the sport, improvements of the racing. Especially myself _ I find myself talking about topics that I didn__ really have any intention of talking about. But we find ourselves in a time where we're not focused on the things why we__e all here. We're here to go racing, we__e here to create the best show for the fans, to have the fastest cars, the safest cars, the best technology, the best engineering _ and yet we talk about fines and punishments and swearing. So yeah, maybe something should change. We're open to it, but we just ultimately want the best for the sport.",Miami,thursday,Mercedes
Lewis Hamilton,"I don't even know. I've not really put much thought into it. Yeah, it's amazing working with Anna [Wintour] and her team. It's been a privilege. To be able to continue to do stuff in fashion is fun. Anna's been really understanding _ I haven't had a lot of time to do a huge amount with it, but the work has been in drips over the past two years already with Anna. So yeah, excited for people to see it. Many things. Lots of different things. There's not one particular. Not particularly _ I mean, when I joined Mercedes, the first six months were tough getting attuned to working with new people. Obviously, the engineers I'm working with now are used to setting up a car for a different driver and a different driving style, and I'm used to driving a car with a different driving style. So it__ a combination of a bunch of different things. You're generally always a mixture of the two, but I__ definitely working hard to adjust to this one for sure. No clue. We'll do the best we can. We've not got upgrades or anything this weekend, but we continue to try and optimise the car. Obviously, Charles in the last race did a fantastic job and showed what the car can do in a race. So the goal is to try to replicate that. I can__ really explain it too much. In the Sprint race there__ not a huge amount of changes you make. I think the one thing to take from it is that we didn__ make a lot of changes _ if any _ going from P1 to quali, whereas on all the other weekends we__e been tinkering with the car and making it worse. I mean, there are elements of that that are true. But it__ different for everyone. Yeah, I love it. Trying to stay off the pizzas and the pasta, which I'm not doing very well with if I'm honest. I was there last week and had like three pizzas in two days. I have my hookup _ he keeps bringing me a pizza. I text him late after the day and I'm like, ""Hey, can I get a pizza?"" He keeps bringing me one. But yeah, I really am enjoying it. Not living in Italy currently, but or spending more time is still something I really want to try and figure out how to do through the year. My Italian is not really progressing, so I've probably got to throw myself more into the thick of it. But the team's been well. Lots of changes, a huge amount of work has been going on from my first days there to adjust certain things, for example in the sim, and everyone__ been really responsive and massively supportive. So I__e really appreciated it. That__ a curveball! Yeah, well, I mean David's a friend _ someone I have a huge amount of respect for. Obviously growing up watching him _ particularly as I was massively into soccer, football _ so seeing his story, watching his career, watching his documentary that came out _ which I thought was amazing. And just what he's been able to do, particularly after his active career, is something I__e always kept an eye on. I joined his old management team many, many years ago with the goal of trying to do something similar _ inspired by what he was able to do. So yeah. I just wish him all the best. It's such an amazing, special thing. I spoke to him briefly in Saudi and saw how excited he was. Big congrats to him. Yep, spent some good time in Italy. We went through a lot, did some good sim running. There are things that we__e made adjustments to. We'll see how they work this weekend. Things to improve on_ can't really think. Oh, they mean the track? Track-wise _ I can't really think of anything off the top of my mind that needs to improve here. I think each year we come back, there's adjustments being made. I really haven't got _ no, sorry. I really don__ know. I generally don__. We__e working as hard as we can to shorten that, but it could be longer. Who knows? I don__ think it__ anything to do with the past. No, I don__ think it__ anything to do with my past experiences. I just don__ really think about it. I try not to really focus on opinions of people that have no insight into actually what is going on _ insights from individuals that have never been in my position. So yeah, I just keep my head down and try to continue to enjoy the work that I do with the people I work with. I think ultimately the GPDA is very unified. I think we are working to_ ultimately we want to be able to work closely with the FIA. I think everyone _ all of us _ want to work together and make the sport better. Of course, we__e faced a bit of an uphill challenge in that communication over time. Ultimately, we don__ hold a power seat at the table, and that needs to change, in my opinion. If you look at other sports that have unions, that may be something that comes into play at some stage. As I said, we don__ want to control things _ we just want to collaborate more and have our voices heard. Ultimately, if people are making decisions for others who have never been in that position, it__ good to have the point of view from the driver__ perspective, and that__ all we try to give.",Miami,thursday,Ferrari
Oscar Piastri,"Looking for a couch, I think, is the answer. It was a pretty tough race. Very, very happy to have obviously won and, yeah, made the difference at the start. I made my case into Turn 1 and that was enough. It was really tricky to follow out there. I couldn't really stay with Max at the end of the first stint, just chewed up my tyres and then the clean air was nice after the pit stop. So, great race. We did the parts we needed to right. Still need a bit more, I think. Max was a little bit too close for our liking, but a great race and a great weekend. Yeah, once I got on the inside, I wasn__ coming out of Turn 1 in second. So I tried my best. Obviously, the stewards had to get involved, but I thought I was plenty far enough up and in the end that__ what got me the race. So I'm very, very happy with all the work we've been doing in the starts. And, yeah, that__ what won us the race today. Yeah, that was one of our biggest upgrades this week _ the drink__ working! So, no, that was good. I got some fluids on board, which was nice, but it__ always a tough race around here. It__ a little bit later in the year this year as well, which I think made it a little bit warmer, a little bit more humid. And, yeah, definitely one of the toughest races I__e had in my career. So glad that I could come out on top of it. I mean, the fact that I crossed the line first, to be honest. It wasn't the easiest of wins. I think the start was tough, the first stint was tough behind Max. And then once I had some clean air, it was a bit easier to manage. But I still couldn't afford to take my foot off the gas. It was a difficult race, and Max was quick behind me, so I had to keep pushing. And, yep, I think I could control it reasonably well, but it was a little bit tighter than I would have liked. Maybe. I don't know how long I could've done that, but I felt like I was taking decent risks for the race. The last lap, obviously, I wanted to see exactly what I had, but there's not too much point taking a crazy risk as well. So I think once we had some clean air, our pace was okay. But the end of the Medium stint, I had nothing for Max and it was a struggle. So I think the pace wasn't as much of an advantage as I wanted it to be, but it was good enough. No. I think our car was still quicker. I think it was difficult to be in dirty air. Max was quicker than I expected for sure in the race. I thought over one lap it wasn't a huge surprise to see Max quick, but in the race, I wasn't expecting to struggle so much at the end of the Medium stint, that's for sure. So clearly we've got some work to do. I think our car is still very good, but when you look at the layout here compared to Suzuka, it's the most similar so far, and it's been the two where Max and Red Bull have been closer. I think we still have an advantage. I don't think it's as big on surfaces like this and layouts like this, but we still have a very strong car at the moment. I got a great launch and got myself alongside. And from that point, I knew that I obviously had to brake quite late, but I knew that I had enough of my car alongside to take the corner. We obviously both braked extremely late. For me, I braked as late as I could while staying on the track. And I think how it unfolded is how it should have been dealt with. No. I still want to go out and try and win every race I can. I was saying before, I'm not that bothered by the fact that I'm leading the championship, but I'm proud of the work and the reasons behind why we're leading the championship. Melbourne wasn't a great start to the year in terms of results. But from the moment I've hit the track this season, I felt like I've been in a good place. Leading the championship is a result of all the hard work we've done in the off-season, the hard work I've done personally, the hard work the team's done. I'm more proud of all of those things than I am of the fact that I'm leading the championship because, ultimately, I want to be leading it after round 24, not round five. I'm happy to win anywhere and ideally everywhere we race, but it's a track I've always enjoyed. Even going back to F2, it was a track I enjoyed a lot and had success at. It's a cool circuit, rewards a lot of commitment, and it was nice to win today.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah. I'm going keep it quite short. I just want to say a big thank you to the fans here in Jeddah. It's been a great weekend. I love the track and, yeah, the rest is what it is. I'm looking forward to Miami. So I__l see you there. Yeah. I was very positively surprised, to be honest, because on Friday, it was very, very tough. And it didn't matter what I was doing in terms of driving, management, the tyres would just fall off. The car was a lot nicer. Still limitations, but it was much more promising. And actually, at one point when I started to pull away again, I was quite surprised, positively surprised. We have to stay a little bit calm because this track doesn't have a lot of deg, and we know that when we go to tracks where there's higher deg, we just struggle more. We still need to work on that. But the changes that we made already yesterday also worked for today. So I'm very pleased with that. I don't know. It's impossible to say. I also haven't looked at numbers. For me, I was just positively surprised with my pace. It was much better than what I expected it to be. So that's a good thing. Yeah. Start happened, Turn 1 happened, and suddenly it was lap 50. It just all went super-fast. The problem is that I cannot share my opinion about it because I might get penalised also, so it's better not to speak about it. It happened very fast. I think it's better not to talk about it. Anything I say or try to say about it might get me in trouble. I think we need to find more overall performance, balance especially, and of course consistency. We are not good at every track. That's quite clear. Bahrain, we were lacking a lot. Here, for sure, it was a lot better. But like I said, it's also very low deg and then more cars come alive. So we still have work to do, but at least it's a promising result. Overall, it's been a promising weekend, at the end of the day. We really managed to find a good balance or a decent balance, and that's, of course, positive for us. No. It has to do with social media in general, and how the world is. I prefer not to talk a lot because sometimes your words can be twisted or people interpret it in a different way. It's honestly better not to say too much. So that's what I'm trying to do. Yeah. I've got interesting results here. It's been like second, first, second, first, second. It's positive. It__ been a positive weekend for us, honestly. Maybe didn__ start off great on Friday, but we tried a lot of things on the car and got it in the window. From now on, we need to work more on our weaknesses that we know we have. We need to come with upgrades to fix that. Hopefully in the coming races we can see some progression. Like I said before, it__ just the world we live in. You can__ share your opinion because it__ not appreciated apparently, or people can__ handle the full truth. Honestly, it__ better if I don__ say too much. It also saves my time because we already have to do so much. It__ honestly just how everything is becoming. Everyone is super sensitive about everything. And what we have currently, we cannot be critical anyway. So less talking _ even better for me. I think I__e said it before. People forget a little bit _ last year was his second year. Now he__ in his third year, and he__ very solid. He__ very calm in his approach, and I like that. It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes _ and that__ what you need when you want to fight for a championship. And I think with Mark by his side, he__ helping him a lot. It__ great. People learn from their own careers _ that__ what I had with my dad, and Mark is advising Oscar. At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that__ great to see. I know I cannot swear in here, but at the same time, you also can__ be critical in any form that might __arm_ or __anger_... Let me get the sheet out. There__ a lot of lines, you know? So that__ why it__ better not to talk about it _ you can put yourself in trouble, and I don__ think anyone wants that.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"Yeah. It's the way it is for now. Unfortunately, in qualifying, we don__ manage to extract more out of the car. I was extremely happy with the lap yesterday. I was very, very happy with the race today. I think we maximised absolutely everything. So, I'm very proud of what we've done. Now we just need to improve the car in order to be fighting a bit further. Yeah, he was very chill. Bryan was very relaxed on the pit wall. For me, it was a little bit more intense inside the car, but, yeah. I mean, we have a very good relationship and I think that we can see it on track now and it shows results. So I'm really happy about this. Yeah, by far. I never expected to finish here. Honestly, I thought that this race was about defending the cars behind, especially Kimi. So it was really good. Yeah, we need to keep pushing the maximum and, hopefully, upgrades are coming soon in order to improve the car. But thanks for the support. Yes, I do. At least I feel like we've maximized absolutely everything we could have this weekend. There wasn't anything more in the car. I think we need to focus on qualifying because it's been a very long time I haven't been as happy with the car balance. I feel very at ease with the car in a way that I know I can extract the maximum out of the car more often than not, but unfortunately, the car potential is just not good enough to fight for better in qualifying. In the race, the good car balance had results. We were all surprised by our pace in free air on the first stint. That was really good. Everything else was perfectly executed. Strategy was great. Pit stops have been great the whole season and also the whole of last year as well. There wasn't much more we could have done. A little. The car just felt good. To be honest, I was struggling a lot when I was behind George with the car balance _ a lot of understeer _ and I hate that. As soon as he pitted, the front came alive and the car felt a lot better. Then I could manage the fronts a little bit better, and the performance came much better once I was in free air. I think we are close on the race pace. I think free air dictates a little bit who is going to win the race. That's always been the case. Maybe this year a little bit more than other years. And obviously when that is the case, qualifying is more important. But unfortunately, for two years, we are just struggling in qualifying to put everything together. This weekend the problem is it__ not always the same issue. This time it was four tenths in the first three corners. For the rest of the lap, we were fast. And now today in the race, actually, the first sector was probably the best sector we had. So we've got to look at that. Obviously, there are answers in what we are doing, and we are doing something wrong, clearly. We've got to find it. We cannot lose too many races before finding it because we're already 50 points down in the Drivers' Championship. We're not looking at it too much, but 50 points is a big number. I don't want to be losing more points than that in the next few races. I'm obviously looking forward to trying to win but sooner than next year. Next year is a long way away, and there will be new regulations and everything. It's a bit too early to think about that. We're pushing at maximum to close the gap as soon as possible and win races, but I wouldn't want to wait for Jeddah next year to win. I knew it was going to be tight. He was very quick. I wasn't worried, but I knew it was going to be close. I didn__ know what to expect with the traffic. At one point, I had to avoid, I think, Bortoleto and I went in the marbles _ lost a lot of time. Lando nearly got into my DRS range, which would__e made it trickier to keep him behind. But he got stuck around 1.2, 1.3 seconds for the last few laps. I was happy to keep the position and to have the first podium of the season for the team. In terms of track familiarity, I don__ think it has any impact on performance at the moment. We just need a better car. If we start further up, we__l have our chances. If not, we__e all too close in the race to make a difference. We really need to focus and put everything together in qualifying.",Saudi Arabia,post-race,Ferrari
George Russell,"Yeah, to be honest, before the session, I would have definitely taken a P3. But when I just saw how close it was_ I was really happy with the lap, but you always think there might have been a little bit more in there. But, you know, being realistic, I think this was probably the maximum today. We know on the sort of high-speed circuits, we probably don't quite have the pace of the McLarens, and obviously Max did an amazing job again. So, yeah, congrats to him. I can't really hear you, to be honest. But, yeah, as I said, it was a really tricky session, obviously, with the red flag in the middle of the session, and we had to _ that one lap at the end was all that counted. It was quite interesting seeing the Red Bull do the two laps. But as I said, P3 is a great place to start, and it'll be a long race tomorrow. Yeah. I'm not too sure, to be honest. I've got mixed feelings because I felt there was a bit more on the table. There's a lot of pressure going into that last lap because Oscar had a lap on the board. I think the run plan that Max did with the two laps was a really good one and one we didn__ really consider. Just having that lap on the board sort of takes the pressure off. When you go into Turn 1, you've got to really send it and you're braking at 75 metres. When you've got no lap on the board, it's like, ""I've got no bailout here if I make the smallest of mistakes."" So, look, P3 is much better than I thought and to be so close to Oscar. Congrats to Max. He did a great job. It's going be interesting tomorrow. It was, to be honest. It was discussed more to actually start on the new and put the used on after. I'm sure it was discussed on the pit wall. I'm not privy to every single conversation because I__ just driving the car at that point, and I put my trust in the team. But it's something we'll discuss afterwards. As a driver, just knowing you've only got that one lap... Especially on a track like this, you've got to be full commitment. Turn 1... you're pushing the tyres to be as cold as possible, and I didn__ have the confidence to push them any cooler. I lost a bit of lap time with my tires being a bit too hot, because I was just being a little bit too conservative with them. P3 is a great place to start. I think the deg on the Medium is going be pretty high, so I hope there will be more opportunities than Japan. Yeah. I think it depends on Turn 1, to be honest. Max and I were just talking now. We both recognise McLaren are the standout favourites and definitely have the pace on everybody else. If Oscar gets into the lead, you'll probably see a repeat of Bahrain. If we stay in the order we qualified, I think it could be a tight race until the pit stops. The Medium tyre this year was last year's soft, which only one driver used in the whole race. We saw the tyres were too hard in Japan. We've all pushed to have softer tyres. Hopefully, it won't make it a slam-dunk one-stop, and there could be a couple of different strategies on the table.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"I mean, I was pretty happy with it. There wasn't too much more left in that lap. So, I'm happy with the job I did. I think it was playing catch-up a little bit through the first part of qualifying and then, yeah, that last lap felt more or less like the best I could have done. So, you know, I think Max has done a good job. I think it's another high-speed circuit for them where they seem to be having a little bit more success. But, no, he's done a good job again, obviously. So, yeah, still all to fight for tomorrow. I think our pace is good. It's going to be a tough race and the tyres are a bit softer than last year, so we'll see if that plays to our advantage. It's tough around here. And once you kind of fall out of rhythm a little bit, it's very hard to get back into it. You kind of need to get all the corners right, because if you don't get one right, it means you don't get about six in a row right. So it's a difficult track for sure. But, you know, at night with Soft tyres, high grip, it's one of the best tracks we go to. So, yeah, a lot of adrenaline _ shaking a little bit just from driving around the streets. But, no, it's a really cool circuit and will be a fun race tomorrow as well. At the time, I felt like it was a good lap, yes. I made a bit of a mistake on the first lap and managed to get through that corner much better on the second attempt. And, you know, when you need one hundredth, you can think of a few places. But, no, honestly, it was a good lap that I was happy with. Max did a very good job today, and that was pretty much all we had. It was alright for me. I was the only one with a lap on the board. I knew that lap probably wasn't going to be enough anyway. So I knew that I would have to go back out and improve. But it's a little bit nicer when you have a lap already on the board. But again, when you know you have to go out there and do a better job, then it kind of renders that one somewhat useless. I also saw that Max was a thousandth faster before I went back out, so I knew that I had to improve to get back on pole. It was a good lap. No regrets, really. I'll see how I feel. I think we've got good pace. I think the Red Bull and Max look more competitive here than they did certainly last week. Suzuka is not a completely different layout to somewhere like here with a lot of high-speed corners, so it kind of makes sense to me at least that they're a bit more competitive, and we'll see if that translates to the race tomorrow. I'm feeling confident in what we've got. There's a lot of DRS zones around here, which is a nice difference to Suzuka. So, yeah, let's see if we can make some progress. We spoke about it, yes, but decided against it. Considering I had a lap on the board, I didn__ need to put another one on. It was going to be extremely tight. As Max said, he had to fuel for the whole run. That first lap on used tyres with a bit more fuel, you__e weighing up how much you__e learning versus how much it puts you off. When you don__ have a lap on the board, it__ a very different scenario. For us with a lap one the board, we had done three or four new sets in a row. We decided to go for that single lap at the end, and I think for us, it was the right decision.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I mean, very happy. I definitely didn't expect to be on pole here after FP3 as well and looking at how the whole weekend was. But, yeah, the car came alive in the night. We made some final changes, and it was a lot more enjoyable to drive. The grip was coming to me. And around here, you know, a qualifying lap is extremely difficult because of all the walls. You need to try and nail it. And, yeah, it's really satisfying, you know, to be first here in qualifying is, of course, the best position for tomorrow. Even though I think tomorrow in the race it will be tough to keep them behind, but we're going to give it a good go. Yeah. We'll do our best. I mean, you know, so far, I'm just very happy that we again had a solid qualifying _ much better than what we had in Bahrain, of course. And, yeah, let's see what we can do tomorrow in the race. Good enough, clearly. I felt immediately more confident when I headed into qualifying. We made some minor changes to the car, but they were clearly big enough to feel, and I think that's a bit the story of our car. It can be really hit and miss. When we get it right, I think it's competitive, of course. But, yeah, when we don't get it right, it's a lot more difficult. But all of qualifying went well. Around here, I think it's always important to have quite a bit of rhythm. So, naturally, you do quite a lot of laps. Also, the tyres, luckily, they hold on to do that. Of course, then the red flag in Q3 is not ideal, but everyone has to deal with that. So we opted for that two-lap strategy, and I'm happy that we did that. Just kept me on top of things, and it felt good. I think at the end of the day, you just need to try and have a clean lap, try to be on the limit. But around here, honestly, it's super hard because some corners, like, you want to try and be super close to the wall. Sometimes it works out. Sometimes it doesn't. Braking into 22 is very bumpy, so you don't even see where you're going when you turn in. So it's very hard to get everything right. But, yeah, clearly, it was good enough. And, yeah, of course, in Q3, you risk everything a bit more. Few more high-speed corners. The tarmac is completely different, which has a big influence on the tyres as well. Naturally, when you have tracks where you need a lot of rotation mid-corner, and long-duration corners, which you have in Bahrain, that's a big problem for us. Here, it just seems to be a little bit more competitive. I'm not saying that it's solved, but at least it gave me an opportunity to push a bit better and deal with the limitations that we have a bit better. Up until now, not very confident, to be honest. My long runs weren't particularly great compared to Oscar or Lando. I'm going to give it everything I have, for sure. Does it mean that I have enough? I don't know. But the car definitely took a bit of a step forward compared to what we were testing yesterday. So I hope that will help our tyre life out as well, but difficult to say that gives an opportunity to fight. But like I said, I'm going to give it a go. Yeah. You just keep on trying to fine-tune before qualifying to find that perfect balance. We tried a lot of setup directions again this weekend, and I think we chose the right one going into qualifying. Then it's just fine-tuning. We are learning. We are trying to understand our car a lot better because it has been more hit and miss than we__ have liked so far this year. So a positive that we did get it right here. With the crash, the only thing it meant was that you had to change your approach. I wasn__ entirely sure what to do. At the end of the day, GP said let__ fuel it for two laps. So you do the first lap on the used out-lap tyre, then pit and go onto the new. You carry more fuel, so you__e a bit slower on the first time. But it was the right call. It was definitely the right thing to do for me in terms of feeling with the car and building up to the limit. Yeah. It is a very tough track, honestly. Every time you go out, it__ a bit like Monaco, but much more high-speed, where you go out and you__e like __et__ get ready to send it_ whereas some other tracks it happens a bit more naturally. It requires big commitment from every driver to try to be as close to the walls at the apex, on entry, exit. But it is very enjoyable to drive. The main differences were yesterday where we tried a lot of things. Today, we chose the set-up that we thought was the right way forward here. From FP3 to qualifying was more like tiny adjustments. The gap in FP3 was massive. When the track is really hot, all the other teams except McLaren are lacking a lot of pace. Our tyres overheat more than theirs, and we can't keep it as well under control as them. Every car is a bit better in different areas. Sometimes it's better in high-speed, medium-speed, low-speed, rough surface, smooth surface. This definitely is a bit better for our car. Yeah, let__ hand out the set-up sheet! No. I just want to learn more about the car. If I keep doing the same thing every weekend with the issues we have, you're not learning anything. Some things work, some don__. You note everything down and continue to find different things. That__ what we did again today. I haven__ said what I tested I used. I don__ know. Our long runs haven__ been great so far. Naturally, with how the car was reacting today, it will be a bit better. But I don__ think it__l be enough to be super competitive, especially on the Medium. I don__ know on the Hard, I haven__ touched it. It just shows that when it gets a bit warmer, like FP3, that__ where we are really lacking. In the race, you stabilise with a high temperature, and that__ where in general most teams are struggling more. That will be the same tomorrow. Let__ see how good or bad we__l be.",Saudi Arabia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Oliver Bearman,"Yeah, that was a crazy weekend one year ago. I just hope that physically I'm a bit stronger than I was 12 months ago because it was a really tough race. But of course, to come back one year on is a very special feeling and, you know, I always love driving this track. It__ my third time here and always had decent performances, actually. And then of course, to have my debut as well__t means the track will always be quite special to me, so I'm really happy to be back. Well, I'm not speaking ahead of time, but in F2 it went pretty well for us. I think we had a really good car here. In F1 it wasn't as good, but still, it was a debut which was amazing. And the track is really cool. It's really high grip, which is always fun for us as drivers. And the walls are close, which is always interesting. It__ a really high-speed, high-commitment track__ust a fun one to drive. I think it's a highlight for a lot of us during the season. Yeah, I'm quite happy with how it's going. Of course, the race in Bahrain was a mixed bag. Qualifying was very poor, but we got a bit of fortune in the race with the safety car to maximise and score a point, which was great. The other two races, we really deserved to be up there and scored some good points. And we've had two races now with both cars in the points, which is pretty good. Australia was really difficult, but we turned it around quickly and brought a small upgrade to the car, which allowed us to run it more in the window we want to. Now we're able to extract a lot of performance out of it, which is nice. Who knows? We came to Suzuka not expecting much because of the nature of the track and we were in Q3 and scored points. Bahrain__ wasn__ really sure what we could achieve because we hadn__ done much low fuel there. But without Esteban__ problem, I think he could have been in Q3. I__ still thinking of Australia a little bit in the back of my mind, but I know that we can have a good weekend. So let__ see how it goes__eah, no predictions. Yeah, personally I really enjoy driving on this circuit. And of course, it__ a special track for me as well, having debuted in Formula 1 here. But yeah, driving on this track__his asphalt is great, and the layout is great as well. It produces really good qualifying sessions__lways high intensity. I remember the 2021 quali__t had a lot of people on the edge of their seats. And yeah, us as drivers, I think everyone is of the same opinion that it__ a really fun track to drive. But I also saw that the other one is going up 20 stories or something__here__ always some crazy stuff, crazy circuits and concepts here. I hope it doesn__ go, but I__ sure if it__ replaced, it will be a worthy replacement. Yeah, it__ really cool. You know, being this far into a set of regulations means that everyone is getting closer to the ceiling of performance. Well__xcept maybe McLaren, who seem to have found a different ceiling! But no, it__ cool to see how close everything is in the midfield and it__ crazy how you need to be on it with every lap. Coming from F2 to F1, I was really excited and looking forward to having time to build up through FP1, 2 and 3. But then you realise all of those laps count towards your qualifying lap. So every lap you need to be absolutely on it, and if you miss one lap__ess it up or the balance isn__ there__t hurts you down the line. Maybe it hurts rookies a little bit more__ot having driven at a lot of these tracks before in F1 and stuff like that. But it__ really cool__nd annoying, depending on what side you__e on. But it__ really nice to be in such a tight battle. I think the margin from Q1 to Q2, and even Q2 to Q3 all year, has been less than one-tenth. So you need to be on top of your game, and that's what we're here for. Yeah, since my debut, a lot of things have changed. Of course, stepping into F1 by definition, you have more fans and more people knowing you__hich comes with good things and bad things. But it__ definitely changed a lot, and it__ just part of life stepping into Formula 1. It's what I__e been dreaming of since I was young, so I__ very happy to be here. One of the big things that stands out to me is the travel and the schedule. I__e gone from 14 races in F2__hich seemed like a lot__nd now I__ not even five races into my F1 career and you quickly realise that with all the extra sponsor commitments, testing, simulator and all of that, it's pretty much full-time. I'm looking forward to having a week off next week and enjoying that, because it__ also important to have a balance. But when things are going well, it__ really nice to be in the swing of things and I__ really enjoying it. Yeah, I think the sticking point for drivers is the weight. The weight seems to be increasing every year. Even next year, with the relatively smaller car, the weight decrease is not really a lot. And if you look at the cars from 10 or 11 years ago__rior to the V6 regulations__hey were so much lighter. That__ what makes it enjoyable to drive. Of course, if we can have V8s and V10s or whatever, and do that sustainably, then that__ perfect. F1 is all about bringing new technology to the road and showing what machine and man are capable of. The efficiency of F1 engines nowadays is really impressive. But if you could just have this car but 100 kilos lighter__hat would be great. Fine__uite OK. But I think it's just the travel that's long. Like, if all the tracks could just be in Europe__ut still have the same tracks! No, it's just the start of the season, you know. We go to Australia, we go to China, we go to Japan__e get the furthest three possible races on the calendar. So it feels a bit heavier. And the weekend is not just the weekend. You leave on Monday and you're out there for three weeks almost. So it feels tough now to do all of that travel. You're loving it, but then you have a 15-hour flight back home and you're like, ""Ugh."" I guess I__ a bit impatient, but the more races I do, the more I'm enjoying it. And when the results are coming, I'm happy to keep going, so that__ great. Then we get into European season, which obviously is a bit less heavy for everyone__ot only us, but the mechanics and team personnel. Especially with a small team like Haas, it's difficult for us to have everyone ready all the time at full energy, especially on these long-haul events. So it__ something that needs to be managed. But at the moment, we're doing well.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,Haas
Alex Albon,"Yeah, it was interesting. I don't think after Melbourne we would have ever said that Haas were going to be in the mix and then they came back very strongly. So it seems like they've obviously designed their car and focused on their race car quite a lot, and it seems to be paying off for them. I think in many ways last week we got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car. I think we were on for a good points finish. But that__ it__t__ so close now. As a team, we can reflect on the first four races: we've been very consistent. The gap to P1 has always been very similar. I think the other midfield teams are a little bit peakier. They can score good points, but not every time. I think for us, realistically, we should have had four points finishes in four races. So let__ see. We're just going to keep doing our job and hoping that we can just do everything a little bit better than the rest. Honestly, yeah, it's been a really strong start to the season for us. We felt good in the car from the first lap we drove in the shakedown at Silverstone. It's given us a good feeling. It's much more enjoyable to drive and honestly I'm just enjoying the racing up there. I feel like that midfield pack has become so tight. In Bahrain, in Q1, we just didn__ get things optimal and that__ it__ou__e out straight away. There__ a lot of pressure on every lap that you do in the midfield right now and that's exciting. It feels like every race you go in not knowing where you're going to come out. It's been the most enjoyable season of Formula 1 for me so far. It will be interesting. I think they are soft and we've seen in the past that sometimes the very soft tyres are a little bit different in the way that they feel in high-speed corners. This weekend is definitely a high-speed track, so it will be interesting to know how we can get the C5s working. I think, as has been every weekend so far, the tyres are very sensitive. If you can get them in the right window, it's the difference-maker. All the cars in the midfield are so close together that if you__e in that right window, that__ Q3. It will be interesting. I__e also seen the layout for the new circuit and that looks also equally impressive. It__ a very unique track and I enjoy the circuit. I think it's one of the more thrilling ones for us. Over a qualifying lap, it__ the one that gets our adrenaline going, and I think every driver would probably say the same thing. Likewise, the new circuit is also pretty extreme. So yeah, I__l be sad if it goes, but let__ see. Yeah, I mean, we don't talk too much about weaknesses in the car for our rivals, but for the most part, yes. It's very corner specific and it__ wind specific. It can depend. There are some low-speed corners where we're actually very competitive__hina stands out to me; we were one of the quickest teams in the low speed. So it__ kind of a little bit at the mercy of the corners on the track. That being said, with Carlos joining__es. Firstly, to answer your first question, yes it__ still there in the car, but less so. I think we made some good steps and we've improved other areas of the car in different corners. The car is now being brought together in a much better place and we don't need to sacrifice too much of other parts of the track to benefit the low-speed corner. With Carlos joining, it__ clear that he has a driving style he wants to use with the car. And being totally honest, there's nothing new to what I feel. I think what's really good though is his ideas and a fresh approach__ fresh mind, a different voice saying similar things. We're both very aligned on where the car needs to improve. And it's true that maybe over time I've just become a bit more exceptional on how to drive the car, and he's brought that fresh energy to get it to where he wants it to be. Yeah. Obviously it would be__ think for most drivers__ nice thing to have the noise. I grew up in Formula One during that period_2003, 2004__nd the sound was iconic. Clearly. And the weight__uch lower. But it__ going to take time. There__ been a lot of investment from a lot of manufacturers into these new regulations for the next few years, so hopefully down the road we can make our way back. But for now, let__ see. No, I drove a turbo V6 thing__hich was not that fun to drive. It wasn__ that good and I almost crashed it straight away! But yeah, I wouldn__ mind the V10 stuff. I think it would be interesting to know, in the future with renewable fuels and whatnot, where we can get to. Yeah, I think it__ on the upper end of the limit. It feels like race 10 already. For me, you know__ enjoy my racing. But I think for us, it__ hard to comment personally. I think as drivers, we travel better than everyone else in the paddock. We stay in better hotels than everyone else in the paddock__t__ just a function of being in a privileged position. With mechanics__nd yourselves and whoever it may be__hese are people with families. These are the people that really struggle. At the minute, personally, or as Williams, we do the best job we can with the rotation of mechanics and engineers and whatnot. But it is tight, that__ for sure. Same approach to work? Trying to think now what our timetables are like... No, I think so__es. I think, honestly, we're very similar in the way we approach the weekends. I think we're both quite data-driven. Sometimes you have drivers who are a bit more feel and kind of don__ want to get into the who__ and what__ and why__ of everything. I think for us, we want a different trajectory__e__l focus on different things. I think as a team, we're very open__uch more open than what normally two drivers are. We have open discussions about where we think the car needs to go. That being said, even our meetings are pretty much together. We__e discussing everything as one big piece. So yeah, we__e very, very aligned.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,Williams
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Well, it feels absolutely crazy fast. So, yeah, definitely very different approaches as well on driving technique compared to F2. Probably one of the tracks where you're going to have the most difference on the way you drive compared to Formula 2__specially in the first sector with the high speeds. So, very interesting. I'm looking forward to trying it. If there's something fun about this Formula 1, it__ the high speed that we go. So yeah, looking forward to it. Yeah, it was a tough weekend, definitely in the race. I got a bit stuck behind Stroll in the last stint after the Safety Car and couldn__ get past, even if I felt that I had more pace. Just super difficult. But yeah, just another race weekend. It's just the beginning of my season. There__ a lot of things we took as learning from my side and from the team side as well. Now we try to apply everything here. Well, again, I__e never driven any other Formula 1 car that is not a Sauber in a race. Definitely dirty air is for everyone, but we seem to struggle quite a lot to overtake. When we get too close to people, it just feels like you lose a lot of aerodynamics and downforce. It's tough. Sometimes we feel we have the pace__aybe not to score points yet__ut at least better than the guys we are around. Then as soon as we get close, we just lose quite a lot of grip. It__ been quite tough to overtake, to even get to a position where you can dive on someone. Last weekend, I was not even in that situation. Just a shame, because I want to be fighting for overtakes and positions and so far this year it__ been very tough not being able to do that. Most of the time it's an undercut during the pit stop or trying to stay out a bit longer to try something different__ut not really an overtake on track. Well, I hope in FP1 I'm like you in the question__lat out! It's not easy, if I'm honest. It's not easy. You come from two championships__ou__e used to being in this room but actually after a race, because you win or you are on the podium. Now for us it's already a mega job if you're going to Q2 or fighting for Q3. But there's always going to be someone paying this price at the beginning. If you see George Russell at the beginning of his Formula 1 career, I don't think he scored a point in his first season, or something like this. And now he's one of the best drivers on the grid and doing such a great job. I wouldn__ say fighting for the championship right now, but he's constantly on the podium or fighting for things. So it's all about having patience. There's nothing much I can do right now__ust learn, try to grow as a driver in these tough moments and do a better job every race weekend. Get better, because I'm not fighting for points right now__hat's the realistic situation. Not me, not Nico. Nico did a very good job in Australia with a messy race and managed to score points, but realistically in the last three or four rounds we have not been able to be there by pure pace. What we need to do now is try to point the team in the right direction with the development of the car. We saw last year with Sauber as well__hey were last through the whole year basically, and I think with one or two upgrades they brought, they were back to fighting for Q3. So in this world I've learned something: everything can happen. So we cannot give up. Well, answering your first question, I don't speak with anyone outside of motorsport__ust my family. And with some drivers I do speak, and some of them have been through what I'm going through right now__ough seasons, not scoring points or struggling to do that. You just need to have patience. But it's not news for me. It's not that I came to this season expecting to be fighting for podiums or points every race. I knew what I was going to go through, and I just needed to be strong and keep it up. The team has been very clear with me since the beginning that that was our situation and we just fight for it. I know it's not nice to be in the situation we are, but it is what it is. That's life, I think. Answering your second one__o, not that I know of. No differences. Just normal. Still, we need to try to bring some good upgrades on the car, but not for this race. I think they sell a lot of it! It__ just a very fun track to drive. I'm excited to be with Formula 1 here__s I__e never been. But with Formula 2, it was very enjoyable and definitely one that I would like to keep driving on. I think the world is just moving forward. You need to look forward. Going back to the V10__ don't think it__ the best thing for sustainability and everything. Audi is very committed to the current regulation. They discussed that. I just think we cannot look backwards. Maybe the sound was cool, but we need to think about other things. I mean, I think__ome on__ really think, yeah, it's definitely a lot of races. But you know, it's just the beginning of my career, so I just want to keep racing and keep driving. I don__ know about Alex and others who__e been in Formula 1 for quite a lot already, so maybe for him it__ a bit different. But I want to keep racing. I'm learning new things every single weekend, so for me, if I could have another race next weekend, I would be very happy as well. But yeah, I mean, I don__ mind now__ut maybe in the future I__l change my mind. Jet lag, jet lag! No, I__ OK. I__ young, you know__ike one day and I__ fully back on it. I don__ have this thing.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,Sauber
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, hope so. I think the first couple of weekends have been not easy for us, some challenges with the new car. But I think the high-speed content should be a little better for us. So yeah, we really hope for a better weekend. We__e still actually discovering a little bit the car and some of the weaknesses. I would say that the first four Grands Prix, the low-speed corners were probably our weakest part of the track. But there are some concerns as well of bouncing and other stuff that we are facing from time to time. So yeah, we are working hard on improving those. And as I said, here there__ super high grip, a lot of high-speed corners, so all in all, should be a better weekend. I think in Formula 1 there is never a quick enough fix to solve your problems. Competitors are strong, they are also improving their cars and [fixing] their problems. And it__ always a race off-track to get the car better and better. But yeah, I think we have a couple of ideas. Some of those have to do with the set-up that we could try on the weekends as well. And yeah, here we have stable weather conditions, so let__ try to use FP1, FP2, FP3 to maximise the track time and learn about the car. Less important. Less important than last year, because this year__ cars are a continuation of last year__. The last race in Abu Dhabi_ I don__ think that the results that we are seeing now are very different compared to Abu Dhabi and the first four races. So I think next year is a completely new set of regulations that completely reset what you learn this year. Maybe it__ not super useful for next year in terms of aerodynamics on the car. So yeah, obviously you always want to finish the season on a high and keep the motivation high for everybody. But I think the motivation in the team is super high anyway because, as we said many times, we have our wind tunnel now working since a few weeks ago, we have Adrian in the team, we have Honda coming, new regulations, so the motivation is really high. I think ultimately it__ his decision. He has enough experience, knowledge and background to know what is best. And I think he__ working only on 2026, so if he__ deciding that, I totally support that. Yes. It__ been an incredible journey so far. I think this is the 50th Grand Prix for me with Aston. I could not probably imagine what we achieved in these 50 Grands Prix. But now we are facing some more difficulties than the first part of the journey. At the same time, we are a much better team and much more prepared to fight for World Championships than we were two years ago, where we had a very small factory, we were using Mercedes_ wind tunnel, and maybe we didn__ have the right people and partners in the project. So yeah, the results on track on Sunday are not the same as they were before, but I feel very relaxed, very motivated. This is just a transition time where we have to learn things and prepare the team in a different way for the time that we have the car ready to fight for championships _ the team will be ready in that moment too. I don__ think so, as I have a contract for next year. But I see the rumours as very good for the team. As you said before, the world champion is sometimes linked with some other teams and a possible departure from Red Bull. And the teams that are being mentioned are Mercedes, Aston Martin, and Ferrari _ as your colleague said. So this shows the project that we are in and the future that this team has. As I said last year when I extended the contract, I will drive for as long as I feel fast and competitive and the team needs me behind the wheel. But my contract is much longer than my racing career, so I will stay with this team for many, many years in a different role. If that means we can win a World Championship even when I__ not behind the wheel, I will still feel very proud of the project. Yes, but it__ unlikely to happen. I don__ know. I mean, it__ not about right or wrong decisions. You make your choices. When I left Alpine, I thought that I would not fight for a World Championship there. They may do in the future, but not in the short term _ and I don__ have a long-term future, I will not race forever. So in the period when my racing career is active, I thought Aston Martin was a better place. I did enjoy 2023, being competitive. And I do enjoy now the process that we are in and the building of this team of the future. I sometimes say we are not the team of the present _ and that__ what I would like to have, because in the future I don__ know if I will be behind the wheel. But I will do my best to help us achieve the best results as soon as possible. For us, to have Aramco together with the team is a huge plus. It__ a great partner, the best partner we could wish for. The relationship with Aston Martin and Aramco is more than what we think _ we work very close together, especially for 2026 with the new synthetic fuels. There is a lot of work going on. I think we could have an advantage having Aramco in the project, as they are the biggest and the best company in the world. So I think it's another part of the project that _ without them _ maybe the team was not able to create the best team in the world for the future. You need the best partners and we have them with Aramco. No, I think nothing new to what I said in Japan _ and you caught it now. I think it reminds me a little bit of my time in Ferrari in 2010 and 2012, fighting for the championship until the last race with the third or fourth-fastest team, sometimes not even in Q3, winning races and things like that. Those are exceptional circumstances, not the normality. I think I received credit in those seasons for my performance. He receives credit now because no one doubts that he's on top of the game. But it is hard. You cannot afford any mistake. You cannot get it wrong in qualifying, you cannot get caught in traffic, you cannot get an impeding _ you cannot get anything. If not, everything is out of the box. So yeah, it's extreme, but it's a challenge. Not at 50, but I don't know. That's why we kept open the possibility as well. I wanted to race this year for sure and next year for sure because of the change of regulations _ and I wanted to experience the 2026 rules and Honda coming to the team. Then the surprise that Adrian was joining the team a few months after that. There were things that were appealing last year when we sat together and negotiated the contract. But after 2026, I don't know. I will go season by season. I will see how I feel, how motivated I am. Now I am very motivated, but I cannot guarantee that for three or four years and compromise the team. So we said let__ do it until the end of 2026 and then from then on I think I have an incredible relationship with Laurence and with Lance. We can sit and talk honestly between all of us and check what is best for the team. I will always be in a position to help the team with whatever they need. If it's behind the wheel, I will extend the contract if they think that way and I feel motivated. If it's in another position, or I don't feel fast enough, I will be the first one to raise my hand.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,Aston Martin
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I hope a bit better than Bahrain. I mean, a few more high-speed corners, different tarmac. I hope that we can be a bit more competitive and maybe a bit more in the middle between the two races potentially. Yeah, I mean in general here it__ always been a bit like a one-stop race. And I think there__ always a bit more going on when you try and have maybe a two-stop or whatever. But let__ see first how the tyres are going to hold up. It__ going to be quite warm as well to drive. I think we__e experienced enough to focus on this year and next year. But naturally, we__e still trying things with the car. Not even bringing parts to the car, just setup-wise and other things that we can improve. It__ constantly trying to improve the car. That__ what we__l try to do again this weekend. I don__ know, to be honest. I just keep working, keep trying to improve the car. Naturally, Bahrain wasn__ a great weekend for us. I think we were all pretty disappointed with that. We just keep on trying to improve the car, come up with new ideas to try on the car. The competition is tough. That__ how I go about my weeks _ just trying to improve the situation. No. I think just focus on commentating, I__l focus on driving. Then you don__ need to think about any other scenarios. Yeah, well, we struggled a bit with the balance. Entry to mid-corner balance is not where I want it to be. So we__l try to fix that and improve that. How much we can fix that here, I don__ know, but hopefully the tarmac also helps a bit with that. Yeah, I don__ know. I mean, honestly, a lot of people are talking about it, except me. Like I said before, I just want to focus on my car, work with the people in the team. That__ the only thing that I__ thinking about in Formula 1 at the moment. I__ very relaxed. Yeah, last year was great. I mean, I enjoy this track. It's very challenging. It's tough _ anti-clockwise _ and in the race as well your neck really feels it here. It__ very hard to know, of course, how we__e going to perform this year, but this year has been a little bit more difficult than the start that we had last year and the year before. Nevertheless, I enjoyed last year and the year before when we were really competitive and dominated races. At the same time now, it can be a bit frustrating, but on the other hand it's also quite enjoyable in a way _ the challenges that are out there and trying to improve the situation. Yeah, I mean I am happy. I'm just not very happy with, of course, our car. But I think that goes for everyone. We all want to be better _ there's no secret about that _ so that's what we are trying to improve. I think we had really good chats in the last few weeks already _ with the people about the car. I think we are all very much aligned. Like I said, we__e just trying to improve the situation. It doesn__ change anything. So just keep going. I'm not thinking about that. I just go race by race. Like I said, hopefully it will be better than Bahrain. If we can be a bit in the middle of the two, I think we can already be happy with that and we just move on. The rest is out of my hands anyway. At the moment, we__e not the quickest. Naturally it__ very tough to fight for a championship. But it__ still a very long road. I mean, we were sitting around this time last year, race five, and it was all looking great _ and then we all know how the season ended up. So yeah, I'm hopeful that we can still improve things and we'll see what we get. I think, to my knowledge, they were having just a conversation about everything _ which I think is allowed. Now, if someone picks up on it, people can always see it in their own way _ how people are discussing things. But I think we were all left frustrated with the result and, of course, the things that went wrong in the race. I think that's where my manager Raymond and Helmut spoke about it _ and even Christian came along as well. So they all had a conversation. I think that should be allowed. We all care at the end of the day. We care about the team, we care about the people, we care about results. I think that's quite normal. Elusive? Not accessible? I mean, it worked out quite well in Suzuka. I was still not entirely happy, but it was enough to be competitive. It__ just very hard _ a very narrow window at the moment _ and we have to try and improve that and find, in general, a bit more performance. But yeah, we are working on it.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,Red Bull
Isack Hadjar,"Yeah, I think it was definitely not as good as the last two weekends, even Melbourne. It__ a bit of an outlier, Bahrain, because track temps and a really different tarmac, there__ no grip, and you don__ feel like you__e driving a Formula 1 car there. So yeah, we definitely struggled a bit more. I still had the car that was able to go to Q3 with a better lap, so still not too bad. And then definitely on Sunday, we had a tough lap one and from there the race was pretty much over. I still think it was not as bad as it looked, but I want to believe that Jeddah is going to suit us way better. Yeah, every track I go to in FP1 is always impressive the first time because your last reference is from Formula 2, so it__ always a bit of a shock the first few laps. But to be fair, now I__ up to speed. But yeah, I__ definitely looking forward to this track, especially Sector 1. It__ going to be exciting. Make sure the belts are tight! Yeah, not too tight. Watch out for white lines. This kind of stuff. That__ all _ details. On my side, having five other rookies on the grid is nice because of the atmosphere. I know them already since karting, most of them, and when you race them on track, you know what to expect because you have this experience from the lower categories. Now it's definitely way better than if I was the only rookie on the grid _ that's for sure.",Saudi Arabia,thursday,RB
Oscar Piastri,"50th victory? I hope it's my 50th victory! No, great to have this result out here. It's been an incredible weekend, starting off with qualifying yesterday and, yeah, to finish the job today in style was nice. So, yeah, can't thank the team enough for the car they've given us. It's pretty handy out there. So no, it's been a great weekend and, yeah, very proud of what I've done this weekend as well. Very proud to do it here in Bahrain as well. It's obviously a very important race for us, given our owners, and it's never been a track that's been kind to us. So it's nice to finally have that first win for the team. I would have preferred to not have it, yes, but I was still pretty confident. I think the pace was good. I was pretty confident I could get a good restart. I also knew that Lando and I were the only ones with another Medium, and that was the tyre to be on, so from that side of things, it was relatively straightforward. Obviously, you try and get a good restart__ou never quite know how it's going to go__ut no, I was never going to let that one go. I don't know. I'm sure there's going to be a hell of a party. I'm not going to get involved because I__e got to race again next week. But no, it's been a great weekend for everybody. And yeah, it's a great, great place to do it. So I'm sure everybody will enjoy it__nd as they should. Thank you very much. Cheers. Very. It's been a great weekend _ maybe not FP1, because that was pretty diabolical for everyone, but FP2 onwards has been very, very strong. I was happy after qualifying yesterday and I think that made quite a big difference today. So yeah, very, very pleased with how the weekend__ gone and happy to come away with another win. I mean, we kind of thought most people would start on the Soft. You know, George only had one Medium and one Hard, and there were quite a lot of people around us that were in the same boat. So yeah, we felt starting on the Soft was going to be the best option, and I think it was the right choice in the end. So pleased with how we managed everything. I think we had the pace today to be able to manage things pretty well. But yeah, I think we made all the right calls. No, it didn__ work. I don__ know what happened. It worked on the lap to grid and then when we plugged it in for the race it was still working a little bit, but I had to draw the water out pretty forcefully, let__ say. And then once the race got underway, I couldn__ get any water through the straw. So that wasn__ ideal, but you know, Bahrain is not the most physical race of the year. If it had happened next week, it would have been a much bigger drama, but we'll make sure it's fixed. I think both have been good. I__e been happy with how I__e driven all season so far. Maybe not all the results have been exactly what I wanted, but I think this weekend has definitely been the result I wanted. So yeah, been proud of the job that I__e been doing and very proud of the job the team__ done. Obviously the car is in a great place. Still has its moments where it bites, but for a lot of the time it__ an incredible car to drive and clearly very quick. So yeah, very proud of the work we__e doing. This has been a track that__ not been kind to us in the past, so to have a weekend like we have had this weekend is a really meaningful result _ outside of the victory. I mean, this weekend I felt comfortable with it. I think there have been times where it__ been tricky, definitely. But I would say for the most part, I__e been pretty happy with the car, to be honest. Clearly it__ got a lot of pace. We__e kind of known from pre-season testing that there__ some things that we wanted to iron out, but I think we__e done a very good job of doing that. And yeah, I think for myself, I__e been comfortable _ especially this weekend _ in what the car__ been able to do. And I think the team__ been doing a great job. I think that's probably the most polite and nicest question I__e ever been asked. Yeah, I mean, it__ obviously very, very special to have the first win for McLaren here in Bahrain. OK, first podium and win for the team here. (Looks at George) This guy... See, I lost my train of thought now. No, it__ fantastic to have the first win here for the team. It obviously means a lot for everybody involved. There__ been a lot of tough years for the team at McLaren, and obviously the owners have been at the head of trying to turn those problems around. So to now have... Obviously, we had success last season, but to now have success for the first time on home soil for the team is an incredible result and very deserved. So yeah, it__ great to have this success. (Laughs) Sorry, George has absolutely stitched Lando up on Instagram _ that__ great. Yeah, I think I echo very much what George said. I think, compared to previous generations, now talent is definitely the biggest thing that you need. In the past, that__ not always been the case. I think there are still other factors involved. As George said, the way to F1 is still very_ you know, you need to be in the right place at the right time going through the ranks. You need ultimately someone to replace on the grid. The grid is incredibly young now, so it__ as difficult as ever to kind of work your way through. But I think, yes, talent can get you to Formula 1 with almost nothing else now. And I think the support of the F1 teams is more than it__ ever been. I think the cost cap as well has been a good thing from this side of things because pretty much all the teams on the grid are able to find all the money they need for development, and they don__ rely on drivers to bring it anymore. So yeah, I think the sport__ in a great place. I mean, I thought it started from Melbourne, to be honest. But yeah, it__ still so early. I think at the moment we__e got a great car underneath us. I feel like for the most part we__e been able to do a good job with it. I mean, I think we__e in the positions we should be in. I think it__ going to be a tight battle. I think there are going to be other contenders. What we__e seen at the moment is_ We__e not had a consistent challenger week in, week out. It__ kind of been somebody different, which from the championship point of view makes life difficult for others. But yeah, I think it__ going to be a tight year, definitely. And I think as long as we have the best car, it__ going to be tight between Lando and I.",Bahrain,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, it felt all under control for a moment and then suddenly we had a brake-by-wire failure. So suddenly the pedal was going long, and then it was going short... I didn't know what was going on. The steering wheel wasn't working properly, so it was really hard fought to keep Lando behind. I think one more lap, he would have got me pretty comfortably. But nevertheless, really, really pleased with P2. I mean, Oscar was in a league of his own. So congratulations to him and to McLaren. We knew they'd be pretty extraordinary around this circuit, and that was proven right. But for ourselves, you know, it's been four races, three podiums__ll on different types of tracks__o it gives us confidence going into the future. Yeah, I'm not too sure how that one worked as well. I saw, you know, Charles behind me on the Hard and I saw 24 laps to go. I thought, you know, __eez, how the hell are we going to make this work?_ But we did. The team did a great job and it's been a great weekend. Yeah, we basically were having all sorts of failures and basically we did an override on the DRS. And on one lap, I clicked the radio button and the DRS opened, so I straightaway closed it again, backed off__othing gained. I lost more than I gained, it was only open for a split second, so kind of goes to show you the amount of issues we were having. But, as I said, really pleased with P2. Yeah, it was exceptionally difficult towards the end. I had all sorts of problems with the car. The steering wheel, I was losing all my data and the brake pedal went into a failure mode, so I had to do all these resets. One minute the brakes were working properly, the next they weren__. So I was pretty pleased when I saw the chequered flag, to be honest. Yeah, I don__ really know how that happened. It was something to do with all these failures we were having. As soon as I saw it opened, I backed off. I lost two tenths of a second. It never happened again throughout. I didn__ actually click the DRS button _ I clicked another button and it opened. As I said, I lost a lot more than I gained _ I don__ think I even gained anything because it was open for less than a second. Yeah, I mean, I__e not actually had that many P2s to be honest. I__e had a few P3s, but we did not expect to be anywhere close to McLaren this weekend. Qualifying on the front row was a real surprise. And then seeing Lando right up there on lap one behind me, I thought, ""He__ going to fly off into the distance here."" Oscar did an amazing job to control the race, but to keep Lando at bay, I was really, really pleased about. Yeah, a lot of confidence, to be honest. This was the real sort of test for us. We knew that our car likes the cold conditions, and the competitiveness we showed in China and Suzuka was no major surprise. But this was going to be the question mark _ here in Bahrain. And we've had another strong weekend. So it bodes well for the season. I__ love to say so, but I don__ think we are, to be honest. McLaren are just too dominant right now. I think this is probably going to be their peak performance _ what we saw this week in Bahrain. And what we saw in China and Suzuka is probably their worst-case scenario and they still obviously got one victory from those two races. So we__e got to keep on picking up the points, picking up the pieces. And this weekend we picked up the pieces to get a P2 _ and we did it in Melbourne as well to get the P3. I don__ expect this to continue for many races to come, but who knows. Yeah, I think this is probably the most complete grid we__e ever seen in Formula 1. Everybody who__ here is here on merit. The sport is in the strongest place ever, so you don__ need that external resource that some drivers brought in the past. And I guess now it__ the duty of the sport and the FIA to help at grassroots level because _ there__ no secret _ it is extraordinarily expensive in go-karting and Formula 4, and we need to_ Yeah, I posted that photo of you _ I__ sorry! We need to ensure that the talent is coming through at that young age and it__ not only the ones who have the resources behind them from age seven to 17 that get the chance.",Bahrain,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"I didn't think I was that far forward, I guess, nothing more than that. So, a tough race. Of course, I made too many mistakes with the overtakes, the out-of-position. It was a messy race for me and disappointed not to bring home a 1-2 for McLaren because it would have been lovely at home. So, a tough one__ut still a few positives. No. I just got told. It was close. I mean, it was good racing throughout, so no complaints. Just good fun. I mean, good overtakes__veryone hard and on the limit, as it should be. So, a good one. No, he did a good job. So, yeah, I thought I'd be able to get him. I guess he was probably just saving a little bit for the end, which, yeah, he did well. So he did a good job. Oscar did a good job. So congrats to Oscar and the whole McLaren team. And I'll try step it up for next weekend. I mean, the car's good. It won the race. So yeah, as happy as I can be. I mean, it__ a different situation. I qualified sixth yesterday which is pretty terrible, so how can I possibly be happy? That just doesn__ make sense. Of course, I__ a little bit happier today that I managed to get back to P3. I had a good start, all those things. But I think P2 was the best we could have achieved today _ so we should have achieved it. But we didn__ _ and I didn__, because of some mistakes. So, mixed feelings. I think the pace is good _ the car is obviously mega, as Oscar showed, but yeah, just too many mistakes there. That it__ finished, probably. No. I think at the beginning I was too far back, so I tried to creep forward and crept forward and did the opposite. First time I__e ever done this in my life. Shouldn__ happen, but it did _ and I paid the price for it. I mean, when I was in P3 I was pretty happy. I saw it was going to be tough to get past George. They__e not been that bad this weekend. One and a half tenths off pole position _ so they__e clearly not struggling. I didn__ expect to get past that easily, and I mean, I didn__ at all. I was happy _ a good opening lap, aggressive and attacking, which I needed to be. But then I had the penalty and everything got a lot worse, you know? So I had the penalty, boxed earlier than everyone else, had to push more to try and make up five seconds _ just about made it up. But then I__ on older tyres, much hotter tyres, and then kind of paid the price for that again. Just every time I did one thing good, I did two bad in a way. I just kept stopping myself from making as much progress as I should have done today. So I mean, I__ happy that the pace was there. Difficult to overtake _ clearly the dirty air is just horrible. I__ happier with my pace today than I was yesterday, but still just not in the best feeling with the car at the moment. I wish I knew. I wish I knew the answer. I don__ have an answer, honestly. Even if I did, I would share it with you guys. I don__ know. You just know when you__e _ I think when you__e an athlete, when you__e a driver, whatever it is _ you just know when things click, when you feel confident, when you feel comfortable. I__ confident that I have everything I need and I__e got what it takes. I have no doubt about that _ that I__ good enough, and all of those things. But something__ just not clicking with me and the car. I__ not able to do any of the laps like I was doing last season. Then, I knew every single corner, everything that was going to happen with the car _ how it was going to happen. I felt on top of the car. This year, I could not have felt more opposite so far. Even in Australia, whether or not I won the race, I never felt comfortable, never felt confident. The car was just mega and that__ helping me get out of a lot of problems at the minute. But I__ just nowhere near the capability that I have _ which hurts, hurts to say. I spent a lot of time, even last night. I left late last night to look into everything and understand what I__ struggling with, what__ not clicking. Trying to figure out what__ changed from last year to this year. Is it me? Is it some of the car? It__ complicated. But I__ not doubting myself, even though sometimes it may seem like that. It__ just something__ not gelling, something__ not clicking, and therefore I just don__ feel comfortable when I__ in the car. I__ confident _ like I know I__e got what it takes _ but just not confident. And when you__e not confident in the car, to know what the limit is, what to do in the slow speed, high speed, any corner _ yeah, I__ never going to be as quick as I need to be. And especially when you__e fighting the best in the world. As soon as you__e not settled, then it__ going to be an issue _ and that__ what happening now. First podium. The same. I mean, I__e been obviously with McLaren for a little bit longer. For some reason Bahrain has always been one of our trickier circuits where things have always gone wrong or we've just struggled. Especially in the last few years together, Bahrain__ always been at the beginning _ and the beginning of seasons have been our weakness. This year is the opposite. We__e proud to race for Bahrain and call this one of our home races. We know we have a lot of support here from everyone, from the whole Kingdom. So it's a pleasure. It__ nice to have His Highness here and everyone, to share this, because it__ a big moment for them. It__ a very small, cute little country, but it__ nice that they have the presence on behalf of McLaren, and that__ something I think we__e very proud to represent. I__ sure they__l all have a little well-behaved party and celebrate as a big family. Yeah. The thing is, I think it would be even harder for me to not show any of these things. A lot of this is _ when I do my interviews and whatever _ a lot of it is probably just getting my frustration out. It__ just because of not achieving what I want to achieve. It__ because of my desire to do well and my ambition to win. When I know what I can do and what I__ capable of, and I__ not even close to reaching that _ like yesterday _ I__ very disappointed in myself. That__ just the way I am. I__ just so hungry to win and I work so hard to win. When it doesn__ go my way, and when I mess up myself, then I__ very disappointed in myself. But during the interviews and saying things I do, I don__ think necessarily have a bad impact on myself negatively. I__e done it so much my whole life, I__e learned how to block my own comments away from my thoughts. Maybe sometimes I lack a bit of self-belief, and I have done in the past. But this is just also me. It__ the way I do things, it__ the way I work, it__ what has made me as good as I am, and probably maybe at times has limited me from becoming a better driver. But, like I said, I know what I can do and I__ happy. I think what I can do and what I can achieve is good enough and easily up there with the best. So I just need to get back in that rhythm. And yes, maybe sometimes I__ too hard on myself _ like yesterday. But I came back today after a nice sleep, re-energised, new day and good to go again and put up a good fight, which I felt like I kind of did. So, you know, this was one day. Today was a new day, and I have a few days off now to recover and go again. Well, one day I wish I could drive with my car and dance with it too, you know? I mean, it__ part of sports, it__ part of any athlete _ goes through tough moments and bad moments, the worst and the best. That__ the way it is. So yes, remaining positive and optimistic about the future and working hard with your team is a big part of it. I definitely don__ think I lack in that part _ the hard work and working with my team and trying to figure things out. But it__ life _ sometimes things go your way, and sometimes things don__, and sometimes it__ more easy, sometimes it__ not. You just have to keep pushing hard through these moments and working hard _ which I shall do over the next few days and the next weeks and probably months. Yeah, it__ still good fun at the end of the day. It__ the sport that I love to do, and I want to go out and win. So I__l keep fighting until that day comes and till the end. I mean, there__ a lot of young kids and young people here. Hopefully, just _ I mean, McLaren winning here I think is a perfect opportunity to showcase that and try and get more drivers from Bahrain. You know, I remember karting here back in 2013 for the World Championships _ one of the best tracks in the world, probably. It__ good fun. Bahrain is small _ there__ not that many people _ but the more we can get them into the racing spirit and hopefully have them part of our racing journey, then the better. Oscar__ put it very well, honestly. I think we knew coming into this season _ us as a team knew it before the season _ that we were going to have some close moments between us and some good fights. And I__ sure we__e going to have more later this year, which I think we__e both excited for. So we have to keep working hard as a team to keep ourselves ahead of the rest. Because I__ sure we both prefer if it__ just me and him _ between us and no one else. As a team, we__ prefer that. It__ probably make our lives easier as a whole. So we__e not forgetting that the competition is close. Yes, we__e got the best car on the grid and things like this, but one mistake _ and I paid the price yesterday. One tenth and I would__e been second on the grid today, so it__ frustrating. But it__ close and it__ competitive, and I think that__ a great thing for the sport. But we have to keep working hard as a team. I don__ think we__e ever let that thought go _ with how close some of the previous qualifying sessions have been. With Max on pole, with George only a tenth and a half off yesterday. It__ easy to not do a perfect lap and then not be on pole still. It__ not like we can just cruise around and everything__ groovy. So, we have to keep working hard, and I think we__e excited for the competition between us.",Bahrain,post-race,McLaren
Charles Leclerc,"I mean, honestly, I didn't expect P3. I knew that in Q3 there was some lap time. I knew that in Q1 and Q2, I just had to be patient and wait for the track to come towards me in Q3, which was a bit tricky because at the beginning of Q3 everything felt really bad with the old tyres. But then as soon as we put the new tyres it was quite a bit better. So I'm happy. I did not expect it, but I think it's a result of... We explored quite a lot of extreme set-ups in the last few weekends and it feels like I found my way a little bit, and little by little I hope there will be more performance to extract from this car in the weekends to come. Yeah, definitely. I mean the team has pushed like crazy to try and bring those upgrades here. I don't think it's the best track to have these upgrades on, but it's always good. It's a small gain, it's not a big one, but hopefully next week it will be a bit more of a step forward. But again, I think if we are P3 today, especially considering such fine margins with P4, the upgrades helped. Thank you. It was really good, but I don't think today's performance relies on my record on this track. I think it's the result of a lot of work. At the beginning of the season, we obviously weren't where we wanted to be and since two or three races I've gone in an interesting direction setup-wise, which seems to help me to extract a bit more out of the car. That's what I'm trying to do every weekend. For now, it seems to be better and better, which is a good sign for the future. I'm happy with the lap. It was very tricky to put everything together, but I think I did so. There wasn't much more inside the car. Again, I think as George mentioned, I did not expect to be so close to pole position _ just like him. But tomorrow is going to be a bit more of a challenge. Honestly, McLaren seems to be extremely good with tyre management and more specifically the overheating of the tyres. We've seen it in FP3 _ I think everybody was struggling a lot _ but Oscar put a lap in that was very impressive. I think tomorrow in the race there will be lots of that, so I don't think we expect to challenge the McLarens, but we might be pretty close with the Mercedes, also with the Red Bulls. So it's going to be an interesting race. We all have different tyres. A good start will obviously be essential, especially with high temperatures like this, to have clean air plays a big role. Yeah, the team has done a really, really good job. We've all pushed quite a lot in the last few weeks because we've been struggling with performance. I know that at the factory they've been pushing like crazy to try and bring this floor a bit earlier on, and that definitely made the difference. Because if I look at the gap with P4, it's not that much and I'm pretty sure that without the floor I wouldn't be P3. So that's already one position won. I'm curious to see what it will do tomorrow. However, it's probably not the best track to extract the maximum out of this new upgrade, but in the next few weekends we shall see more of it.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Ferrari
George Russell,"Yeah, 100%. I think if anybody said we'd be within half a second of the McLarens, we would have taken it, because we would have thought that would have been sort of P3 on the grid. So to be second on the grid is a bonus. Congrats to Oscar, great lap and excited for tomorrow. I__e got to be honest. I think the strides were being made with the night time coming in and the track temperature getting a little bit cooler. We saw it this morning in Practice 3__hen it was roasting hot, the McLarens were down the road, and now as this session unfolded, we just seemed to get quicker and quicker. So yeah, lining up P2 is a great chance tomorrow but I think being realistic, it will be a challenge to fight with Oscar. Thank you. Cheers, guys. Yeah, it was a really strong Q3. To be honest, I wasn't really feeling it throughout qualifying and didn't have the confidence in myself, which was quite a surprise. I don't know why that was. Q1 and Q2 were a real challenge. But in Q3 I just got back into my normal rhythm and put in some strong laps. Really surprised to be a tenth and a half off pole and ahead of one of the McLarens and also Charles up there as well. We were talking before _ I think we were both shocked to be this close. So yeah, definitely a strong one. No, no, it was just all in myself, to be honest. Q1 and Q2, usually you're building up to Q3, but I hadn't been feeling comfortable with the car today. And like Oscar said, I was doing donuts this morning, which is not really the best prep ahead of a qualifying session. But in Q3, I just sort of sent it and had a bit more confidence in myself and the lap came together really nicely. So yeah, really strong, really clean lap and a great place to be. I mean, this weekend's totally different, to be honest. I was very disappointed in Japan with P5. I felt that we had the potential to qualify much higher up the order. But this weekend I wasn't expecting to be on the front row. I thought P3 was going to be by far the maximum we could have achieved today. Realistically, anywhere from P3 to P6, maybe even P7. So to be on the front row is a real surprise. I don't expect it to be a straightforward race tomorrow. I think Oscar is going to be mighty fast. They seem to be a long way ahead of the field when it comes to tyre overheating and the track being too hot for the tyres, which is what we're going to experience tomorrow. So let's see how it pans out. I think unlike the first three races of the season, this isn't going to be necessarily a qualifying race. I think this is going to be the race which is most biased to the lap times you do in the race. Obviously I hope to make a good start. I've been on the front row here before and got into the lead at Turn 1, so hopefully I can repeat that. But I think they're so far ahead of everybody. They can pit early, pit late _ they'll probably potentially overtake us on track. But as I said, today we're on the front row and nobody expected anyone but Lando and Oscar to be on the front row. So maybe another surprise tomorrow.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah. I mean, I felt confident out there pretty much all weekend, to be honest. FP1 was... an experience for us all. I think it felt more like a rally car than an F1 car, but from then on I__e felt really comfortable with the car. In FP3 we had good pace and yeah, qualifying, you know, the others caught up a little bit closer than what I wanted. But yeah, still delivered the laps when it mattered, which was the most important thing at the end. So very, very happy. Let__ see. I__e got to get to Turn 1 in first, first. So let__ see what happens. But yeah, felt like I__e been comfortable all weekend. And like you said, there__ no better place to start than on pole. So yeah, I can__ thank the team enough for the car they__e given me. And yeah, I__ excited for the race tomorrow. Yeah, very happy. I think the car all weekend has been in a good place. Maybe not in FP1, but I don't think anyone's car was very good in FP1. Since then I felt very comfortable all weekend. This morning, given the track conditions, it was a pretty solid performance and the car was very similar this afternoon, so I'm very, very happy with the job we've done. I'm proud of the job that I've done. I feel like I've put in a lot of good laps when I needed to and to come away with pole is obviously very nice. A little bit everywhere I think. I honestly can't remember exactly where, but just little bits around the lap. The first set I had in Q3 had done kind of an out lap on the red flag in Q2 and I don't know if that made a difference or not, but when you leave the garage and they're not nice and shiny like they normally are, maybe there's a psychological thing as well. So yeah, just found a little bit of time everywhere and it was a very solid lap. Maybe a little bit wide in 13, but the rest of the lap was pretty solid. So I'm very happy. It was tough. I think the timing of the red flag was quite awkward because it was right on the limit for being able to do two runs and no one had set a lap at that point. And being at our end of the pit lane, getting out of the pits can take nearly five minutes sometimes, so you have to factor that in. We went pretty risky and just went for the one lap and it was enough obviously. That was a tricky point that you needed to get right, because otherwise your weekend was pretty much in the bin. I'm glad we managed that. Q3 was a little bit more simple, just the two runs. Yeah, very happy. After I saw him doing donuts in FP3, yes. I think the performance we had in FP3 was even a mystery to us and we knew everyone would get a lot closer. It's been kind of up and down for everybody. One session seems to be Charles that's challenging us, then George. Max was quick at certain points. It sort of seemed like everyone was peaking at different times. Still had to be on my toes because a tenth and a half was a bit closer than I expected after this morning, definitely. Yes, probably. Everyone's got very different tyres up and down the grid. George has only got one hard and one medium. Charles and I have got two mediums. Max has got two hards, so it's a bit of a mix. We'll see what everyone goes for tomorrow because I think it's a bit of a lottery at the moment. I think it will definitely be more exciting from a strategic point of view, but for my sake, I hope not too exciting. Let's see where he finishes first. Obviously, it's nice to be on pole, but like George said, I think this is probably the first race so far where qualifying doesn't mean everything. I think it's obviously still important, but I'm expecting him to fight back tomorrow. I'll just try and make sure that I do the best job that I can, and wherever he ends up is where he ends up. I mean, from my side, I'm certainly not shying away from the fact we have the best car at the moment. I think to say otherwise is not correct. But it is difficult and the margins are still pretty tight. It doesn't take much of a mistake to lose one or two tenths, and that's been the gap more or less. At times we have looked very, very strong _ like this morning, for example _ but I think when everyone turns up for qualifying, we know that we still have to put our best foot forward. Like we saw in Japan, we didn't quite get the most out of the car, got pipped by Max. And today, Lando's not on the front row, so it's difficult, definitely. I certainly don't think we're fast enough to do whatever we want, but we do have a nice advantage at the moment that we're trying our best to make sure we continue to use week in, week out. Yeah, I think so. P1 was a bit of a write-off for everyone, I think. But FP2 already, I felt pretty confident. FP3 this morning was obviously very strong, but in conditions that weren__ particularly representative, so you always _ I kind of wish that that was when qualifying was. But I think I've been comfortable with the car from FP2. We've not had to change too much from then. For myself, it's been a car that's been relatively straightforward to put consistent laps on the board and it's been quick as well, which is obviously the most important thing. I've just felt very comfortable this weekend. I think I've felt comfortable the whole season so far with the car we've got, but this weekend has been another step forward on top of that, which I was able to show today.",Bahrain,post-qualifying,McLaren
Carlos Sainz,"Well, if you expect to see the best of Carlos Sainz in a Williams in the third race and in a new car, then yeah, you don't understand the sport very well, or you know at least how long it might take for a driver to actually get fully up to speed with the car and to fully understand where the last tenth and a half or last two tenths of each car lies. Looking back at the first three races, I think I still haven't yet put a full weekend together. The speed has been there__n Australia and Suzuka. In China, I had a bit of an off weekend through many different reasons. But to be honest, in Australia and Suzuka I think I was pretty quick, especially given that I'm still new to the car. To manage to be close or in the same tenth as Alex all the way through quali, I think it's a good start to the season. I just need to make sure now we start doing less mistakes when it comes to executing the weekend and keep improving my speed because obviously I believe the speed still__e can improve it a little bit. But yeah, we are not as far as it seems. I feel like we just need to put a full weekend together and it will come. Very useful, especially because here in testing I felt very comfortable with the car. Actually, it's a balance and a car that I've been looking forward to targeting in the recent races. Given I was not as happy in China, I looked back at the test to a set-up that we were running here and I was keen together with the team to try and put the car somewhere closer to the way it felt in Bahrain test because there I felt like I was up to speed and driving fairly naturally and I didn't have to think so much while driving. While in China, I remember, and even in Suzuka, I've been having to really break my head to understand how to drive the car and to extract all the performance from it. But yeah, you first need to go through these weekends where you have a bit more of a challenging time to understand that and reverse engineer that. That takes time, you know. It's 24 races. We've only done three and obviously everyone expected me to be straight up in the pace, which is a good thing. It means people value me and expect high things of me. But I was the first one that after Bahrain test when I was P1, I was like, I'm nowhere near where I need to be still with this car to perform at the level that I want to perform. So I was the first one coming down expectations and knowing that the first quarter of the year was going to be tough. Especially with a guy like Alex pushing hard and doing such a good job, obviously, it always takes a bit of time to get to that level. So I'm calm. I'm just down to my work doing my things and it will come. Yeah, you know, sometimes you jump into a Formula 1 car and you're just naturally quick. Whatever you do to the car, the lap time comes easy. And I felt that was the case in Abu Dhabi test last year and in Bahrain test this year. I didn't need to think while driving and I felt like as soon as I jumped in the car was quick__ctually quicker even than what I thought I would be. I was surprisingly quick in my own expectations. And then we went into Australia, the balance changed a bit. The tarmac changes quite a bit from Bahrain to Australia, China and Japan with all these resurfaces that have been done and the car just feels completely different. The through-corner balance is different and you're just a bit stuck on __hat do I do now to my driving?_ or __hat do I do now to the car?_ to go that one more tenth quicker. As I said, I was not far, I was within a tenth. That's where you start digging into the data and you start working with your engineers. But you need to go through this whole loop, whole process, to actually get to conclusions and understandings, and that takes time and experience and some races. But as I said, I'm calm, I'm happy, and we're getting there. I think, to be honest, they're a bit too technical to explain them in a press conference. We can try and sit with a piece of data in front of us and an onboard and I can maybe explain it to you. So yeah, I'd rather not go into that level of detail of the little things that you need to do with your driving style to extract the most out of each car. Obviously, Ferrari had certain car balance, a certain direction that we followed after three or four years of developing that car that required you to brake in a certain manner, turn in a certain manner, release the brake in a certain place__hich you fall into a trap of after three years of muscle memory of doing everything that way. And when you jump into a different car, and especially under pressure in quali, you try and find the last two tenths of the car. You fall into your muscle memory because that__ the muscle memory that you have from three years. It's not that you need to unlearn them, because those traits are actually making me very quick also in other types of corners. But you need to remember, in a certain type of corner, to not do it. That__ why it's almost impossible to ask anyone to be quick in the first three races with a car, when you are only putting it the first sets of Soft tyres and zero kilos of fuel for the first time in those first three races__ompletely different tracks, completely different conditions, completely different tarmacs__nd you're having to relearn a lot of these things. And as I said, given how new everything is, for me to be in the same tenth in quali as a guy like Alex in Australia and at a confidence track like Suzuka, I'm not in a bad place. I just need to make sure I put the whole weekend together, with the penalties, with finding the lap time exactly in Q2__ecause now Q2 for us is the lap of your life, with the field within two tenths in Q2. So if you don't put the lap in that moment of Q2, your weekend is over because you start 12th instead of P9. You cannot overtake in Suzuka and you cannot overtake in the midfield. So it's the very small details that need to come together. Very confident. I think Alex has been able to extract the maximum out of the car these last three races, and all the progress that we've made during the winter since we changed the car, since I arrived, all the setup directions that we've been taking__t's also leading into those positive results. And there's a lot more to come in this team. I can tell you already, it's amazing the amount of work that is being done back in the factory. The level of performance that we've managed to add to the car since last year to this year, I think it's just in a very positive trend and in a very good direction. It's something that extremely motivates me to try and help and try to contribute as much as possible. I'm doing it in other ways right now rather than on points. I wish I could do it also in points, but points will come during the season. But I'm very motivated, I'm very impressed with all the steps that the team is doing. Yeah. I think first of all, fair play to Pirelli. They've done a step__e__e always asked them for the tyres to degrade less and be less sensitive to overheating. They've done a step, and this year so far we can push more in the race. Now we're back into one-stop races and we are complaining that there is not enough deg and we want more deg. So first of all, I think F1 needs to get all together to kind of follow up with the same narrative. Because we asked for one thing, the product improves, and then suddenly we all complain again. It's a bit of a mess, if you ask me. What creates overtaking in my opinion is to have a delta to the car in front. If you're only one tenth quicker in F1, you're never going to pass. You need to be five, six, seven tenths quicker than the car in front around Suzuka to overtake. And the only way to generate that in Suzuka is with degradation. You cannot generate anything else. So I would be happy if they're going to maybe go a step softer in compounds. Given that the tyre is more robust, going softer in compound will increase degradation and increase a bit the chance of overtaking. But if you go with the three hardest compounds on a track like Suzuka, for example, you'll have flat-out racing with the three compounds and pit stop laps always more or less the same way. We all stopped on one lap. I think you will not get a tyre delta or an overtaking delta. So for me it's more about trying to make sure the race is always between a one- and a two-stop, because like that you will have teams trying to do one-stops with high degradation and other teams running faster on a two-stop to try and overtake and make it to the flag. That's my opinion. But as I said, we need to kind of all organise a bit our thoughts and keep Pirelli more of a clear understanding and target. The Mercedes PU is probably the biggest change in changing teams that I've had to adapt to. One is aerodynamics and suspension, you go through, everything feels different. But when they change you the engine, that__ when you really feel some big differences. I do feel very big differences compared to Ferrari. There are also things in the way the team operates__ith upshifts, downshifts, patterns, and the way they make the power unit work__hat, as you could see in Australia, caught me out. But at the same time, you need to go through that experience almost to understand that this happens only in the Mercedes PU and not in a Ferrari. It__ interesting, because it__ quite a big change and it's incredible how different two power units can be, but how close in performance they can be at the same time. So, yeah, I__ trying to give the team__nd Mercedes__ood feedback from what I believe Ferrari was doing better, and at the same time, giving feedback on what I think they are doing better than Ferrari. We are all trying to improve. I wouldn__ be too vocal supporting the comeback of a V10 engine if I liked what I saw from 2026. But as I don__ really like what I see from 2026 in terms of what the car is going to do, the engine__ going to do, the way everything is going to work, I would say yes__ would like a V10 engine with a few tweaks to make it back sooner rather than later. But at the same time, it's not fair to not give those regulations a bit of a chance, if everyone believes they are so good. But everyone seems to believe that they are not so good anymore__hat__ why everyone__ talking about it again. So a bit of a strange one, no? Let__ see where it goes. It__ not up to me. It__ politics. The big bosses will decide. I think I__ the biggest supporter of punctuality and being__n a way__ gentleman, being punctual to things, and especially a national anthem, with all the authorities there. So I was the first one to put my hand up and say, __'m late. I'm sorry for that._ At the same time, I was five seconds late. And to be five seconds late and have to pay _10,000 or whatever the fine is, for me, it is out of the question that we are having to pay these fines. But yeah, I don__ know if I__ going to get another fine for saying this, but **** happens. It__ the way it is. It__ the way it goes sometimes. I mean, _10K is__ou guys know what _10K is. And for five seconds, it__ disappointing. I hope, as I__e always said, I hope someone tells me where this _10K goes. And they say, __K, at least it went to a nice cause,_ and I will be looking forward to seeing where they go.",Bahrain,thursday,Williams
Kimi Antonelli,"Yeah, that__ funny actually. Yeah, it's going to be completely different. I mean, Suzuka was cold__ew surface in Sector 1, so obviously it was changing a lot the way you had to manage the tyre. I mean, Sector 1 during the race was flat out the whole race and honestly, you didn't really have to manage that much throughout the rest of the lap just because I think also Pirelli improved the tyre quite a lot from last year, and it seems like it's much more robust. So you're able to push and it was nice. I mean, in Suzuka it was nice to have a stint like that where I didn't really have to worry much about tyre management and I was able to push. So that was really good fun. But yeah, this weekend it's going to be completely different. I mean, I think it__ the most open tarmac we have during the season as it's one of the oldest as well. It's going to be much hotter also compared to the test. So obviously, tyre is going to be a really big topic, especially for the race. So it's going to be a bit of a different story and also with the mindset, it's going to be important to change the mindset__specially in order to be able to manage the tyre. Yeah, I mean nothing more to add. I think Suzuka__ou know it's an amazing circuit to drive__ut obviously the racing is quite difficult because the cars are getting more efficient, you're able to run less downforce with the rear wing, so the DRS effect is even less. It's even harder to overtake. Plus, Suzuka__ got only one DRS zone. And especially also to follow is not that easy because you go through the first sector which is super quick, and with the dirty air it's really hard to keep up. And then you only got one shot on the main straight. But at the same time, Turn 1 is not a corner where you brake much, so it's really dependent on the circuit. But I think this weekend is going to be a completely different story and especially with the strategy, it's going to a lot different, and a lot more to play with. Well, I met him when I was quite little__ think it was 2018. He was doing the Monza GP. And, you know, the first time I met him I understood why they call him the Iceman, to be honest, because I remember going to him super excited and he had completely no reaction. So, you know... but I think he's such a cool dude. I never really got the chance to properly have a chat with him, but definitely something I would like to do. It would be cool also to have some advice about racing for sure because he has done a lot in the sport. So definitely something I would like to do in the future. Yeah, I mean it__ obviously a really, really big topic. The V10 sounds amazing, so definitely it would be cool. But I think as a driver, what you want is something that gives you good drivability and is consistent and also lasts. So I think, you know, the level that this engine reached now is pretty incredible because they can run at flat-out full speed for the whole Grand Prix__nd for many Grands Prix. So I think as a driver, you just want something that is reliable and that has good drivability.",Bahrain,thursday,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"Qualifying ahead of Max was probably the key to that. Yeah, I mean, we looked through it. I think it was pretty clear to see that you needed a very big pace advantage to overtake on Sunday. The best way to overcome that was, like I said, qualifying a bit better. But I think even in the race, we were pretty limited with what we could do. We've spoken through a lot of the potential different scenarios we could have found ourselves in and what we actually could have done differently. And I think the conclusion from all of those was there was either a big element of risk with not much chance of reward. So I think there__ still some things we could have done a little bit differently to try. And I think as a team we acknowledge that. But also, just putting into perspective how early we are in the season and not giving away points unnecessarily to people behind us was important as well. So yeah, we've gone through a lot of things, but ultimately I think our conclusion was: make sure you qualify where you should be. I don't think it changes much. I think we have the quickest car at the moment. But our advantage is not enough to be careless and kind of lay back and not execute as best as you can. We saw Melbourne was a very strong weekend for us, but we also got the most out of the car and both of us felt we drove very well. I think China in the Sprint__print quali, Lando went on pole__nd I think China and Japan have both shown that it doesn__ take much to go wrong for us to not be at the front. We have an advantage in the race for sure, but in qualifying you have to still be on it because the gap is not much still. As we saw in Japan, Max put in a good performance and it was enough to be better than us. So I think that's just another demonstration that it's going to be tight the whole year and we__e got to be on our best form. Hard to know. I think Melbourne, especially on the Inters, was a very good race and a good show of pace. But like you said, managing the tyres__ think Japan, if we had track position, potentially the race could have looked quite different. We'll have to wait and see. Obviously it's very hot today. I think Sunday is supposed to be a little bit cooler, but it being a little bit more difficult on tyres and a bit warmer probably will be more friendly for us than others, I hope. One day, but not for a while. I'm pretty happy in F1 at the moment. I don__ think so. I don__ think you do either championship justice by trying to juggle both. I think maybe for the F1, it__ probably actually not that detrimental to the F1 championship, but when you__e got a lot at stake, as we do right now__nd also just not giving Le Mans the respect it deserves from a preparation standpoint__ think that__ not something you want to go into being underprepared. So I'll wait until I__ done with what I want to do in F1 and then I__l think about letting Zak give me a burn in a Le Mans one. I'm pretty confident we__l be strong all year. I don__ think it__l change too much. I__e not spoken to the team about it massively, in all honesty, which probably tells you enough about that. So yeah, let__ see when we get to Spain, but we__e still got a lot of races until then and I think we__l be a strong team all year round. No, is the answer. I think it still has a bit of fine tuning to go. I think it__ been a good process with the FIA and the manufacturers with the cooling system, and I think it will be a big positive for us. But for me personally, it__ not quite ready to be used. There__ been a lot of good work going on, but I think Sunday, given it__ a night race and it looks a bit cooler, I__ not sure we__l actually trigger the heat hazard with the FIA anyway. So if you want to use it, it will come with a weight penalty on Sunday. I think there__ still some work to go, but it__ going in the right direction. I mean, yes. But I think if Max had qualified third and we were first and second, it probably would have looked quite different as well. So I don__ think it was_ yeah, I think it was light-hearted. But I think qualifying made a very big difference. I don__ think it__ normal to have two cars sitting two seconds behind the leader for 50 laps. It was kind of clear to see that our car was quicker. But yeah, I think the gaps would have been quite different if it had been the other way around from the start as well. I should clarify__o you get fined as well if you swear, or is it just us? OK. I think everyone has their own personality, everyone has their own style. I think the most detrimental thing you can do is try and do it in a way that__ not your own style. For some people, that looks very different. There are certain characteristics that I think you do need. Obviously being fast is the most important one. But there are certain traits that you need. But I think, as Lando said, that doesn__ mean you need to be a bad person. You need to be tough on track. But there__ a lot of different ways you can go about it. I don__ think there__ one style or one perfect mould of what a Formula One world champion looks like. I think they__e all looked slightly different. You could argue that some of them look similar in a lot of ways, but again, I think the most important thing is to try and do it the way you want to do it, and that will give you the most. I don__ know. I don__ plan on finding out. I think clearly the car looks pretty difficult. We__e seen that with Liam. We saw it with Checo last year, even with Yuki in Japan. So again, I think going into an environment that has been so focused on the way Max drives for nearly ten years now__t would be a very tough environment to go into and have immediate success. But yeah, I__ quite happy that I__ driving a McLaren and not a Red Bull at the moment. I mean, yes, a little bit. I think every year you adapt to different things on the car. You know, I think for me the car__ not completely different to what it has been last year especially, and even the year before. It__ just faster, which is a good thing. But yeah, I mean, even from day to day, you know, Suzuka, we had a 20-kilometre headwind through Sector 1 on Friday and a 20-kilometre tailwind on Saturday, and you know, it makes the car behave quite differently. So I think adapting is the name of the game in F1. And you know, there__ some things inherently in the car that we want to try and make a bit better and make it a bit easier for us. But yeah, I think every car you drive, you have to adapt to at least one thing because, yeah, as much as we want it, I think the laws of physics stop us from having the perfect car. So you__e always going to adapt to something. It has its moments, yes. I think it's not a completely different car to what we had last season. I think there__ a lot of ideas and philosophies that are the same. But yes, it's been tricky to get all of the lap time out of it in every session, and I think we've seen that. But you know, if I had to pick out of all 10 cars on the grid right now, I'd still pretty happily be choosing ours. Am I World Champion in both scenarios? Yes? Then I don't care. I mean, I think obviously as a team, we want to have the fight between just Lando and myself. That__ kind of the, I would say, dream scenario. Maybe for Andrea and Zak it__ slightly stressful, but ultimately that__ what you want. You want your two cars first and second and not have to worry about the others. That__ the dream, right? And I think for myself that would be a good position to be in as well. I think, you know, for me, if there__ other teams involved, it__ not a bad thing. And I think for the sport, we obviously want to see it competitive across multiple teams, and I think we__e been getting closer and closer to that, especially last year and probably through this year too. So like I said, if I__ World Champion in either scenario, that__ fine with me. But I think just needing to worry about your teammate is probably a slightly easier scenario than having to worry about, you know, three or four other teams. Yeah, I think you__e right. This has not been a great track for us in the past couple of years. Well, I think even longer than that, to be honest. So I think it will be a good test for us. I think there were certainly strong points from the test that we were happy with. There were certainly not-so-strong points that we__e done a lot of work to try and improve from the test as well. So it will be a good test for us. I think, you know, on paper the layout is still__his car is not a completely different beast to what we__e had the last couple of years. So there are still parts of this layout that, if you were to draw a perfect layout for the car, it probably still wouldn__ look like this. But I think we__e as confident as we have been in my time at the team. We are in a position to win this weekend, and I think we have some evidence from testing that we__e in a good place. But yeah, it__ also about 20 degrees hotter than testing, which is going to change things as well. I__e not been in the sim for a long time [Inaudible] I think we as drivers have an important role to play in trying to make next year__ regulations as successful as possible. I think it__ pretty well publicised that there__ been some challenges to overcome. But this is what we have for next year and for the years to come, and I think we need to try and do the best job we can to make the sport exciting, make the cars as fun as possible to drive, make the racing good. Yes, there__ obviously a lot of romance and romanticism about V10 engines. I wasn__ old enough yet to hear them when they were racing, so I don__ have quite the same nostalgia, maybe. But it would still be a cool thing to have, of course. I think going into a new set of regulations already speaking about another potential eventuality__e just need to be a bit careful and not downplay what we are going to have for the next few years to come. I__l drive whatever I get given. I__ a Formula 1 driver and I__l always be happy to drive in the pinnacle of the sport. But let__ wait and see.",Bahrain,thursday,McLaren
Esteban Ocon,"Not quite yet. No. One day, definitely. I think it__ the dream of every driver to race at Le Mans one day. But yeah, as Oscar said, I__ very focused on my Formula 1 career at the moment. Looking at how many races we have, it__ going to be quite complicated to mix it all. You can__ do a half-half, you know? You need full implication on both and that__ where my head is at. Yeah, I think we have good potential. We just need to be able to unlock it every single time and be able to optimise the car on every track. Melbourne was extremely difficult and quite a shock for all of us in the team. But we managed to get some good performance out of China and the car suddenly came alive. It__ been more difficult again in Suzuka. This is what we are working on at the moment to try and figure it out. But yeah, here it__ more the home of Formula One. We__e done three days of testing. There__ a lot of learning that has been done. There are things that we are going to continue testing on our side as well. But it__ going to be an interesting weekend and we__l see. Yeah, we will see after Friday. It__ a very difficult circuit for many reasons. It__ the roughest of the whole calendar. There are a lot of traction zones. It__ going to be interesting to see if what we__e done in testing is going to actually work when everyone goes flat out. So on Friday, we__l have a bigger picture. But it doesn__ tell the whole story, I think, because it__ so far out compared to every other track that what we__e done earlier in the year is more common than this one. Yeah, there__ a lot going on for sure. It__ not an easy task, but I feel the team welcomed me in the best way possible. We__e put a lot of hours in the winter and in testing to be able to adapt to everything before we got to race. I think now I__ pretty well integrated in the team. There__ still a lot of learning and where to optimise the car exactly on my side. But I think it__ been pretty straightforward in what we needed. I really wanted to arrive into the first couple of races and not feel like I forgot or went through something that we just missed in terms of preparation. And I think on that side, the team has done a great job in preparing me to be ready. Similar answer to Oscar. No. I think it__ a very good initiative the FIA has done for us to be able to fix some of the issues we had in Qatar a couple of years ago. It__ a good initiative, but unfortunately, I can__ quite use it at the moment. The way the seats are designed and some of the vests__t__ very different to what we are currently using. It__ much more bulky and a lot bigger. We would need to basically redo a complete seat and I__ not even sure that doing that would still be suitable in corners. So yeah, good initiative, but I think they need a bit more thought behind it, or from our side as well, on how we could accommodate it better. I think this week we__l be OK. Next week__e were looking with Lance earlier on the weather forecast__ight be another story. So we might have to use it next week. Let__ see. Yeah, it was obviously great that the team managed to bring some updates reacting from Australia. That was an incredible turnaround to come back with some modifications for already round 3. So really good on that side. Ollie always ran that on the Friday and then I got the upgrades on the Saturday, from FP3 onwards. We__e still investigating exactly why we were not performing as well. Unfortunately, the race pace was similar to the qualifying pace__e were not as fast as we needed. We had a bit more bouncing on my car, we were lacking some straight-line speed as well. So yeah, these things made it difficult to extract the potential of the car. We__e keeping investigating. There__ going to be some more testing on Friday across both cars to be able to know exactly where that__ come from. But the good thing is that it worked on Ollie__ side, so we should be able to transfer that into my car very soon, no doubt about this. And from there, it should be an easier time. Yeah, I mean on the V10 subject, I don__ think the issue is with the sound at the moment. These engines are incredibly powerful and great to drive. There__ a lot of talk with the hybrid system__he zero turbo lag, everything is great on that side. But yeah, it lacks sound. It__ not the sound that we loved when we were young. That is very true. But you know, nobody thought about having a naturally aspirated engine with a hybrid system like they do in some road cars__or example the Valkyrie or the LaFerrari back then. It was more of a KERS system that they had in. But we could be running a naturally aspirated engine__6, V8, whatever__ven a five-cylinder would sound great. Even a three-cylinder would sound great. But the issue is the turbo. That__ what takes the sound away out of the car. So yeah, I mean, it__ not for now anyway, because the next regulation is obviously fixed on that side. And yeah, I haven__ been too much following the latest__ haven__ really driven yet the 2026 regulations. There were a lot of issues with the straight-line speed and where the engines were clipping etc. I__ sure it__ going to be a lot closer than that from where it is now. But the important thing is that the field doesn__ spread out too much. Make the racing close__lose between teams. Otherwise, if we end up with somebody at the front just dominating every race, it__ not going to be great for everyone watching at home.",Bahrain,thursday,Haas
Lance Stroll,"Yeah, some good results to start the season for sure. I think it depends on the weekends. Some weekends you get into a good groove with the balance and what the car__ doing from the first lap of the weekend. Other weekends, conditions, this and that, it__ sometimes a different story. But yeah, it was good to pick up some good results those first few races. Japan was a little bit more difficult, but we__l see what we can do this weekend in terms of performance. I think we__e improved the car for sure. But no one stands still in this business. Everyone is always bringing upgrades and making the car faster. So it__ a relative game. We still need to find more performance. We__e not where we want to be, so that__ what we__e focused on. Yeah, it__ been good. Gary has a lot of experience. He__ been really great on the comms and it__ about new ideas to my mind and having some different thoughts around setup and areas to focus on. I think it__ been good and yeah, I definitely enjoy working with him. Yeah, I think the same. It still needs some work, that__ the reality. Depends how desperate you are to be cool in the car. I think it__ going to come down to that in the really hot races if the product doesn__ improve. It__ not very comfortable, but yeah, get a few degrees out of it, so we__l see. It's just the nature of Formula 1. Some years you have good cars and. Same as you have less good cars so. Yeah, not much more to add. It__ all been said. V10s sound good. I think keeping the cars light is important. Light cars are more fun to drive. They__e gotten heavy, they__e gotten big over the years. So something to keep in mind going forward.",Bahrain,thursday,Aston Martin
Oscar Piastri,"Yes, correct. I think the pace today was really, really good and I was very happy with that. Obviously got close a few times and tried to mount a challenge, but track position around here is just so important. So, yeah, I think yesterday was the day where you effectively won the race and I didn__ do a good enough job. So, I'll take the podium. I think there's still a lot of positives to take out of this weekend. I think the pace was mega. Next time I just need to make sure I'm in a better position to use it. Great question. I think for me it was more trying to just cover the guys behind. I was starting to struggle a little bit on the Medium and was in the window to take a pit stop anyway. So yeah, that was kind of the thinking there. I__l speak to the team about what their plan was with it, but I think it was a good strategy. We were kind of a bit in no man's land. I mean, there wasn__ much to be honest. For me, I felt like I had really strong pace and felt like if I had the track position I could go and get Max. But that__ what happens when you qualify behind, unfortunately. So yeah, I at least asked the question and I think that was a fair response. I think it was a good race, and that__ how we want to go racing. Yeah. I mean, I think obviously the result is not exactly what I wanted, but I think in terms of the pace and the way I achieved the result is what I wanted. So yeah, I think yesterday was the day that kind of dictated your weekend a lot and I didn't get the most out of the car. So that unfortunately kind of dictated a lot of what I could do today, and that__ led to the result I've got. I don't know if it's necessarily more important. I think it's always been important. I think in a race like we had today where there's very little deg, it's a pretty easy one-stop, and you're pushing flat out for a lot of it, then yeah, it becomes very difficult to have an advantage with tyres. And I think in Suzuka in the past that is how you've generally tried to overtake people. This weekend, that wasn't the case. So I think it depends on the track. Bahrain, for example, might not quite be the same. But I mean, qualifying has always been important. It's not rocket science to work out that if you start on pole, it makes your life a lot easier. So yeah, I think that's the main opportunity from this weekend. I mean, I think on the pit stop timing, Russell had pitted I think the lap before and Leclerc wasn't that far behind and we didn't really know what the undercut power was going to be like. And you know, we'd gone a fair way into the race on the Mediums anyway. So I think from my side there wasn't anything that was obviously wrong with what we did. And then at the end, yeah, I said what I felt. Clearly the team were happy with the way things were. I mean, if I was in Lando__ position, I would also be pretty happy with the way things were. So that__ fine. Just said what I felt in the car and yeah, that's how we want to go racing. I mean, I think yesterday I was disappointed to be third. I think our car is in a very strong place at the moment. It's still got some things that we want to try and improve. But I obviously know that Lando__ going to be strong opposition given we're in the same car, and I know Max is going to be strong opposition, you know, given everything he's achieved in his career. So I think as Lando said, it doesn__ take much of a mistake from us__r certainly from myself__o let the others in. And I think that__ what we saw yesterday. And as Lando said, Mercedes looked very threatening at times this weekend. And I think Ferrari _ I think people forget that Charles__ race in China he did with, essentially, half a front wing. So I think if anyone else had tried to do the race he did in China, they would have had to box pretty quickly. So I think we have a small advantage, but I think this weekend has really shown that any small mistake and there's a lot of competition there to capitalise. I mean, it was too difficult. I think I needed the straight to be about another 100 metres longer and then maybe I could've had a small chance. But I got close a couple of times, but never close enough to do anything realistically. So yeah, I feel like I had strong pace, but just not quite enough to be able to do anything. And yeah, with the dirty air, once you get so close, it's very difficult to stay so close. So yeah, I think the chance of anything happening realistically was pretty slim.",Japan,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"I guess just lost out yesterday. You know, Max drove a good race today, no mistakes, and the pace was too similar today to do anything more. Long race, a lot of pushing. It was a flat-out race from start to finish _ tough, but just not enough today. Nothing special that we had that could get Max on. They were quick, and no mistakes like I said, so he deserved it. It's racing, I think. He was still ahead, it kind of squeezes into one, and Max is the last guy I expect to give me any space , you know, in a good way, in a racing way, so nothing more than that. Yeah, yeah. I think it__ still been a very good weekend. Didn__ get the positions that we wanted. We__e fighting for a win every weekend, but they deserved it _ both Red Bull and Max deserved it this weekend. They__e quick. They've been catching up, they've obviously made some improvements, and as a team, we didn__ have enough this weekend. So we have to work harder for the next one. First and second in the Grand Prix so far _ not a bad start. Tough. I mean, I could see Max quite clearly for the whole race, but just couldn't make any inroads from that point onwards. So I think him in clean air was enough to stay in that position and he didn't make any mistakes. He drove a good race. So, I don't know, like he said, the race was won yesterday in hindsight, and I guess we always kind of know the better position you start, the more chance you have of winning. But I think our pace was probably slightly better, but not enough to get through the dirty air, kind of get into the DRS, and then passing is a whole other story because it's pretty much impossible to pass here. So yeah, I think it was a good race. We tried some things. Maybe we could have tried a bit more with strategy. Overcut or undercut__e just boxed on the same lap for some reason. So some things we'll discuss, but good points for us as a team. Decent points for me. Of course, would have liked a little bit more, but have to take second sometimes. I mean, we obviously planned some things beforehand and we kind of know what to expect. But yeah, hindsight is a wonderful thing. I think probably could have gone longer, could have tried going earlier, yes, but then you're at risk of Safety Cars and other things. So it's easy to say, __eah, you should have done that._ But if I box three laps earlier or two laps earlier and the Safety Car comes out, then we look stupid. So can't win them all and we take it on the chin. I think we've got areas to work on. High-speed we were very, very strong and I think definitely the strongest car out there. Slow speed__e__e quite a chunk off the Red Bull, and that's where we lost yesterday in qualifying. So we lost again consistently in the race today. So yeah, a lot of areas we have to try work on. Yeah, I mean, like you said, the guys just did a very good pit stop under pressure. It was our one opportunity to try and get a bit closer. I wasn't even trying to race Max, I was just trying to cut the grass like he said! Didn't even know he was there, actually. So no, nothing. He had the position and he had the right to do what he did, so fair play. I mean, it's always so difficult to say. Probably yes. I think after today, our weakness was the slow-speed compared to them. There's a lot less high-speed, so we__e kind of losing some of our strengths and we're going more into our weaknesses. Clearly, they're quick. You know, I feel like between Oscar and myself, we got a lot out of the car yesterday. It was probably a little bit more, yes, but both our theoreticals were not that far ahead. So Max is doing a good job and Red Bull seemed to maybe have caught up a little bit. But they've also not been that bad the whole season. When you look at Australia, he was fighting for a win. When you look at China, he wasn't miles away. And this weekend he's done very good. So I expect him to be challenging us every weekend. I don't know. I probably should have tried to undercut, I think. The thing is there__ always the Safety Car risk and so forth. I think I could have gone longer because I don't think I would have lost position. So that wasn__ off the cards, but yeah, I think we probably should have just tried to run the card and then tried something different. But it just wasn__ today. So yeah, things we__l talk about. Honestly, I think the undercut is not easy here because the Hard is not mega in the first sector. So whether that even would have worked, I__ unsure. And Max still always had a little buffer to me. So even if I did have a good out lap, I don__ think it was enough to probably get past anyway. Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I feel like I get a lot of questions like, __re you surprised by Max?_ when he does a day like yesterday or a race like today. And I guess people always expect me to say yes, but I don't think there is a reason to be. I don't think I ever have. Like you said, I've always had a lot of respect for Max. But you know, there are those moments that when you're in the car and when you're driving, you know what is good and what is not. And I think I don't need anyone to tell me what Max is capable of doing or whether I should think this or that. Of course, I've always got my own opinions, but I'm always going to have the respect. I know how good he's been since, you know, we shook hands back in 2015 or something_2014__nd I was half the height I am now. So, you know, I don't need people to tell me these things. And people seem shocked when I say I'm not surprised and stuff like that, but I know how good he is. I know what he's capable of doing. So I would say nothing is a surprise anymore. But yeah, I still believe that we're going to have some good races and we can go toe-to-toe and that some days he'll come out on top and others I will. Yeah, seems like it. I mean, I still think at times we're going to see some more competition from the guys behind. Charles was not that much slower. I mean, there was a bigger gap, but I think his second stint on the Hards was just as quick as mine. I didn__ think we dropped him at all. So other cars are quick. I think we pushed a lot in the beginning, and it was a race where you just flat out from the off. It was a quick race. But I think we're the three who are the most consistent at the minute and putting in the times in quali and putting the good races in. But George has been quick this weekend. I don't know, maybe again, you know, they struggled a bit more in Q3 for whatever reason and then therefore in the race. But I'm sure like if you put a George starting on pole today, I think he probably still would have won the race. So I think anytime someone does that bit of a better job on Saturday for qualifying, they can have those opportunities come their way. But at the minute, I think McLaren, Red Bull, and probably between us three, we're doing a better job than the rest.",Japan,post-race,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"It was tough, you know, just pushing very hard _ especially on the second stint. The two McLarens were pushing me very hard and it was a lot of fun out there. Not easy, of course, to manage the tyres, but yeah, I__ incredibly happy. It started off quite tough this weekend, but we didn__ give up. We kept improving the car and today it was in its best form. And of course, starting on pole, that really made it possible to win the race. Yeah, it__ very important to always try to maximise your performance and I think we did that very well this weekend. It means a lot to me. It was in the back of my mind as well. On those last few laps, I was like, __ell, I need to try and stay ahead _ it would be a great story._ Our final kind of farewell race together with Honda here in Japan. I__ incredibly proud of what we have achieved over all those years together. And I think this is like a perfect send-off. Yeah, it was a fun race. I mean, the whole race I saw two orange cars in my mirror, and yeah, especially those last 20 laps, we were pushing quite hard out there. You could just feel the tyres were degrading more and more. But you had to keep on fighting it, basically being on the limit. But yeah, it was better than expected, to be honest. My race pace__ do think that probably the cooler track helped us out a bit. Less tyre overheating, and yeah, just very proud with this result. I think most of it of course was done yesterday being able to start from pole, because around here I think it's just very hard to follow. You know, the cars are improving every single year, more downforce, and probably you'll see it's just a bit harder to follow. You only have one DRS zone as well here, so it's very tough. Plus the degradation seemed quite low, so you do a one-stop. So I think that definitely helps. But still, we take it, we really maximised the weekend, and I'm very proud of everyone. It's impossible to tell because you don't really know how long the tyres are going to hold up. But I would say with like five laps to go, I felt like, __his is OK, the tyres are holding on to a normal extent, they're not fully falling out of the window_ So I was like, __ell, from here on it's just make no mistakes and it should be OK_. Yeah, I think the grass was a bit__t was not really well cut on the right-hand side. So I think Lando saw that as well, and he made sure that it was nicely cut. What do you want me to say? Next question then! I don't think so, but honestly, like I said, today we take it. It was very hard to pass around here. Bahrain__ompletely different track, very tough on tyres, tyres overheating as well. We still have work to do. But it does show that if we really nail everything, we can be up there. But from our side, we want to be better than just sometimes being up there. So we just keep working hard and just see where we can be at in Bahrain already. Hopefully we keep on improving the car, you know, with the through corner balance, and then hopefully it unlocks also just in general a bit more pace. Yeah, it does. I mean, it also means, I guess, that I really care, even though of course it's not been the easiest start to the year for us. You know, we are not where we want to be in terms of performance. I think that's no secret. But yeah, this weekend has been really, really nice. Sometimes you have those kind of moments where you get some really great laps out of it. And luckily, of course, also the balance got a bit more together throughout that qualifying. So yeah, we just have to keep on working. I mean it's nice, but I'm a bit of a person__ don't listen to the positives and the negatives. I'm just in the middle, you know. So I just focus on my own performances and yeah, just keep working, keep grinding. The vibe? The vibe is alright. I don't know. I mean, it's a very long season. A lot of things can happen, right? I think what is important is that you always try to just maximise your performances. That__ the only thing that you can control. So that__ what I__l try to do and we__l see in__hat is it, 21 races__here we're at. Good or bad. I think we know our limitations. So we just have to try and run against that limitation as much as we can. But yeah, it's still not fixed. So this is hopefully going to be fixed soon, but I cannot give you a timeline on that. It's just about trying to find that limit, which is really sensitive for us at the moment. Yeah. I mean, of course, already yesterday was a very beautiful day for us. And then of course to follow it up with a win is just fantastic. Honestly, the relationship that we've had with Honda has been amazing. I've really enjoyed my time with them__ow they also work, how professional they are and how dedicated they are. They've given me so much. Together we've won four Drivers' Championships and two Constructors'. It__ been unbelievable and also, of course, something you__l never forget. And it did cross my mind while driving as well. I said it would be insane to win here today, also for Honda on their track as well. So maybe gave that extra motivation to try to stay ahead. But yeah, it__ a proper send-off. I mean, we couldn't have wished for a better weekend to be honest.",Japan,post-race,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I am. I mean, we tried the best we could, I think, to get the best possible balance with the car, but it wasn't easy, even in qualifying. But every session we just kept on making little improvements. I think that's where we made the difference. And then, yeah, the last lap was just flat out. I mean, around here being on the limit__r maybe even a bit over in places__s incredibly rewarding. It's insane. In a Formula 1 car around here__ector 1 especially__s unbelievable. And now with the new tarmac as well, it just gives you even more grip around there. So to commit is even harder. For sure. I mean, this is a proper highlight for us to be back on pole here. But, you know, we will look to it tomorrow. There might be some rain around, but we'll do our very best. Thank you. Yeah, a lot of happiness when I crossed the line. The whole qualifying, we just kept on trying to improve the situation a bit. And the final lap, honestly, it was very good. I had a lot of fun out there, being fully committed everywhere. Some places, not sure if I was actually going to keep it or not, but yeah, it was really nice. And also great for the team as well. It's difficult. I mean, I've had some really nice ones also in other places. But I think if you look at how our season started, even during this weekend... yeah, it's very unexpected, I would say. And I think that makes it probably a very special one. I mean, when I enjoy the track, it's anyway more fun to drive, right? So you have to be super committed. Sector 1 around here is crazy fast, but yeah, it's amazing in qualifying. Yeah, just throwing a lot of different things to try and make it more balanced, which is a bit of a difficulty for us at the moment. And even in qualifying that is still the same. I mean, I could be more committed, but... I mean, I'm on pole, but I'm still not happy with the balance of the car. But we are working on it. And yeah, for us this is a great little surprise. I mean, we did what we could. Now I don't know. First, we also have to wait and see what weather we'll get. And from then onwards, I think it's very important to just focus on ourselves, do the best we can, execute the race of course in the best way possible. But I don't know how fast we will be. Yeah, I mean actually it was a bit better. I think that issue was a lot better today. But at the same time, the through corner balance is still what we need to work on. But yeah, I think on low fuel over one lap, some bits you can mask a little bit. But it__ still not like I go into the lap fully confident and comfortable. So the last lap I was like, well, I'm just going to not try and feel uncomfortable _ just send it in and see what we get. It__ very rare, of course, that a lap like that then can stick, but this time it worked well. We know that we have some issues that we want to solve, but it's clearly not easy to solve them at the moment. I think exit 1 into 2, 6, 7, 8 and then Spoon. Yeah, those places I was like, well, I hope it's going to stick. But yeah, it did. And of course when I crossed the line, I could see my name pop up. But I knew Oscar was still behind me, but I was already just very happy with what I did there because I didn't even expect to be close to that. So yeah, that was a nice moment. It will rain overnight soon _ that will help wet the ground a little bit. The grass has been very dry and with the sparks coming off the car, it can ignite with the grass, with a bit of wind. Where you want it? The sensation? Well, I'm happy that I'm first. I mean, maybe if you want to drive the car, I can give it a go. I think you're going to poop your pants _ is that allowed to say that in the press conference? It__ not easy, but we clearly found a drivable balance. I tried to do the best I could, but around here you need to be very committed, especially in Sector 1. Yeah, honestly, I don't think it has to do with the tyres _ for me, at least. It__ just the through corner balance that is very difficult to manage. But we clearly got it in a window where at least it was drivable to push. Luckily, it was enough for first, but it's still not... I don't say, __h, I'm first, now everything is perfect._ We still have clear issues that we need to solve and that's what we're continuing to work on. This is a very tough track for the car in general. It's really high speed, so any little balance limitation you have can be multiplied in some places around the lap. Some tracks might work out a bit better for us, some might be worse. But it was clear that up until now this whole weekend we have been really experimenting a lot to find that drivable balance. At least it allowed me to push a bit more. It will be very hard, but that's fine. I'll try to do my best. So far this season we have not been able to fight them. But it's not like we just sit there and accept it. We try to do the very best and we__l give it a good fight tomorrow if we can. But at the end of the day, it's a very long championship and you need to keep on scoring points whenever you can in the best way possible. At least we're starting from the front _ then we__l see where we go. Yeah, I mean, honestly, I__e known Yuki for a long time. He__ been in the Red Bull family. He settled in nicely. He__ a good guy, very chilled. So that all went really well. And I think that__ it for me to comment on.",Japan,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"Yeah, I'm happy. Congrats to Max, he did a good job. So hats off__ou__e got to credit something when it's a lap that good, which he must have done, you know. But I mean, I'm happy because I feel like I got everything out of the car today. So, just, it__ tiny. Was there probably that much in it? Yes. But Max did an amazing lap, so we're happy. I mean, for both of us to be up there, for us to be fighting for pole is good. But it's not enough. No. I mean, I dipped a wheel in the exit of 7 and, like, 7 is the last place you want to make a mistake. No, it was just a couple of little mistakes, and it shows how easy it is to lose lap time at the same time, you know. My lap was very good. I'm very happy. If I was to go again, I probably wouldn't go as quick as I did. So I feel like we were on the limit of what we had. We just didn__ have enough today. That's the goal, but no one knows what the weather's going to do tomorrow. So it could be another race like Australia. But it's going to be an exciting race, you know. Of course, we want to try to get past Max, but he's going to put up a good fight. But I've been there before, so I'm excited for it. Thank you so much. I didn't go that much. I mean, I went two tenths quicker than the Q2 lap, so not enough, but just a little bit. It's a track where you just kind of chip away in different areas. And like Max says, commit a bit more in those high-speed corners. But I was pretty happy with my lap, honestly. I tried pushing on a good amount more in Q3 Run 1 and it didn__ work out clearly, so I just had to kind of peg it back a lot. I was happy with the balance and happy with the car at the end. The margin is so small _ I think it was a hundredth in it _ and you__ probably say yes, but yeah, just not enough for pole. Much happier than China. Yeah, the car's a lot more back to my liking. I've got some front end in the car and I'm much, much happier with that. I've been feeling confident all weekend. If quali was in FP1 and it was a Sprint race, I feel like I__ be much further ahead, but everyone's good enough that by the time you get to quali, they kind of catch up a bit. I've been feeling good, the car's been feeling good from the off as well. We've been chipping away. I think between both of us we've been quickest in every session bar this one, so it's the little frustrating one. The corners I still struggle with, the corners I'm still not happy with, are the corners I still just don't have the front end and I don't have the grip in the car when I need it from the front. It's clear what suits me and what doesn't, or just what allows me to be quick and what doesn't. China was one of those weaker tracks, and we come here and the car__ a lot more how I want it. Much better again. No one knows what the weather is going to be like tomorrow, so no point trying to think of too many things. We__l do our homework tonight. It's probably going to be a bit of a race like Melbourne, and that was an exciting race for everyone. Now I've got to try and do some overtakes, you know? So we'll see. It's exciting. I think the unknown of the weather is going to make it exciting and nerve-racking for everyone. And I've got to try to get past the guy on my left, so yeah, excited.",Japan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, it felt good through much of qualifying, especially at the start of Q3. There was a good lap, and then just the last lap, yeah, it just didn__ quite come together as I wanted. But incredibly tight margins. So yeah, I think it's still all to fight for tomorrow. I think we've got a great car and, yeah, just a little bit more left on the table out there today. So try again tomorrow. Yeah, I think so. I think we've got good pace. You know, I think the others have not been as far away as people think. You never quite know with engine modes and stuff like that. And, you know, this morning was pretty tight. So yeah, I think it's not a massive surprise. I think Max has obviously done a great job getting up on pole. But yeah, we've also got a great car for tomorrow and still in the fight for the win. I don't really mind. I think our pace has been good in all conditions so far this year, and I welcome whatever comes. But yeah, let's see what we get. Yeah, it wasn't my best, Sector 1. I think I lost a little bit of time compared to the first lap of Q3. And yeah, when the gap__ four hundredths from 1st to 3rd, you think about it quite a bit. I've been pretty comfortable through qualifying. I think the first lap of Q3 was a good one, the second one just a little bit off the mark in a couple of places. But yeah, I__e had to dial myself in a bit more this weekend than I did last race and it__ taken a bit longer to get there. But looking at the margins and how it performed, I've been pretty happy. Just those little margins _ when it__ so tight _ make all the difference, clearly. No, just see what the weather does. Obviously the game plan is to try and finish two spots ahead of where I'm starting. But apart from that, we'll see what we get. Yeah, I think with the rain overnight, I don't think it will be as big of a problem tomorrow.",Japan,post-qualifying,McLaren
Liam Lawson,"Yeah, I think obviously an opportunity this weekend and maybe something I wasn__ expecting so early, but something that obviously is not my decision. And for me it__ about making the most of this opportunity now. And obviously still being in Formula 1, I still have that. So yeah, it__ been a good week of preparations, so I__ excited to get going. Yes, we__e done simulator and it__ all been OK. Obviously, you don__ truly know until you drive the car. So going out tomorrow will be the first proper test and for sure it__l probably take a session or two to adjust again. But you know, we have three practice sessions here, so yeah, I__l be making the most of that. That was what I was obviously looking forward to from the start, to be honest _ to go to a track that I__e been to before just to have a proper sort of preparation. And I now have that. So yeah, it__ exciting to be here. It__ a track that, I mean, I think we all like as drivers. It__ one of my favourite tracks to drive on, so yeah, I__ very excited. Yeah, that was cool. I think it was the first time they actually had both VCARB and Red Bull drivers together. So it was nice to see the fans all come out for that. It was very cold and rainy and they all still stood out there. So that was cool to see. And yeah, driving one of the older cars as well, with the V8, was pretty cool. I won__ truly know until I drive. I think we all feel good. I feel confident. And I don__ think too much has changed since last year. So yeah, I think the ingredients are there. And obviously the main thing is coming here at a track that I__e driven as well. Hopefully, I slot right in and feel comfortable, but I think we__l find out tomorrow. No, I had no idea in China. It was something that was decided, I guess, the Monday or Tuesday afterwards. I found out after China basically. So yeah, it was, I think for all of us, probably more unexpected. But it was after the weekend. I think we know how Formula One is and how quickly things change. I mean, if I look back a year ago, I had no seat. I was here a year ago watching and wishing I was racing. Then I had the opportunity to race at the end of last year and the opportunity then to go to VCARB. So a lot has happened in 12 months. For me, the main thing is being in a car. I have the opportunity to prove why I belong here and that__ what I__l try and do, and that__ what I do every single time I get in the car. That__ what I__l be doing this weekend. I think things change very, very quickly and where my future is, I don__ know. The only way I can control that is by driving fast. It was more of a done deal, I would say. I left China, started preparations for Japan, and basically I had a phone call saying that this was what was going to happen. So, yeah. I would say, as I said, I was more surprised. Obviously, it__ very early in the season. I was hoping to go to a track that I__ raced before and have a clean weekend to have a chance like that. The decision obviously was made, and when I was told, although it was tough to hear, I had one or two days to sort of think about it. Then I was in Faenza with VCARB, starting preparations and seat fits, and then you__e basically just focused on the job. As I said, I have the opportunity to still be in Formula 1 and still racing, and that is the main thing for me. With this opportunity, I__ excited to be here. It__ been a strong start to the season for this team, for VCARB. So I guess it__ exciting for me now to come in here in this position. No, actually not. Race engineer is Ernesto, who__ been with Yuki in the last 12 months because he had switched last year. But all guys that I__e worked with. And as a reserve, I spend a lot of time with them. So yeah, it__ a group of people that I__e got to know very well, so it hasn__ felt like a shift. I would say, so far, it__ felt like I__e slotted in nicely. Yeah, I guess that__ part of the conversation. I guess in a way that__ great. But obviously I was already there starting the season and was focused on proving myself in the team at that point. So look, whatever happens down the line is more or less out of my control. What I can control is the driving stuff, to prove that. So yeah, where the future goes, honestly at this point, I__ not really thinking about too much. I mean, China was a bit more unique, I would say. Just with the race we tried something with the set-up quite aggressive and it was to sort of get some answers and build a direction with the car. So we went with that and in the end it didn__ work too well in China specifically with the degradation that we had on the front. The car itself felt quite good, but just on the tyres, we were struggling. Coming here, it__ a new place for Yuki. Obviously, it__ a great opportunity and on a track that he__ done a lot, I__ sure he__l probably be more comfortable. And I__ sure they__e done work over the last week as well in the short break to try and work on improving things. I think, yeah, in Formula 1_ It__ motorsport _ we have issues, that__ part of it, especially with these cars that are pushing the limits like they are. I__ maybe hoped that would be taken into consideration more, and I think that__ why for me it was important to come to a place that I__ raced before and driven before. Melbourne and China are both tough tracks, and as you said, with the way the weekends went, they weren__ the smoothest. But it__ motorsport. As I said, the decision was not mine, but I__l make the most of this one. I think confidence-wise it doesn__ change a lot. We all have enough self-belief to be here and to make it to Formula One. If you don__ have that self-belief, it makes it very difficult. So I think we all have that naturally _ it doesn__ really change how I feel about myself. I think what it__ doing for me_ Obviously, the best opportunity I had felt like it was with Red Bull Racing. That__ where we__e all working towards. That__ what I was working towards since joining the junior programme as a 16-year-old. So obviously, I would have liked to make that opportunity work and that__ in my best interest. But obviously, Christian and the team will have their opinions on what__ best, and that__ up to them to decide. I think it__ easy to look at it in that way with how the last couple of weekends went. But as I think we talked about, they were not the smoothest of weekends and at tracks that were very new to me. So in some senses, yes, it was early. But at the same time, I think part of the reason they brought me in in the first place was to adapt quickly. And although that was tough _ yeah, I guess, you know, you can say anything now, that the decision done. But it doesn__ change how I view it or how I view myself. I felt like I was ready, so although the weekends were tough, that doesn__ change.",Japan,thursday,RB
Pierre Gasly,"I don__ remember 2019. I mean, yeah, I wish Liam all the best. I can obviously relate to some things. I wish Yuki all the best. I think it__ very difficult to judge anything from the outside. I think only Liam can know his situation and know all the details from it and you just got to respect that. We__e all trying our best with the tools we have. I__e got no doubts both of them are going to do really well. But yeah, it__ not really for me to comment because you never really know what__ going on. I think China, objectively as a team, we slightly underperformed. We realised after the weekend that there were obviously a few things we would have done differently with hindsight. That__ why I__ still confident. We__e got a good package, we__e got the performance to fight in the top 10. And it__ really about_ We__e still early stage in the season, we__e still learning about the car and how to extract everything from it. So it__ good we__e got three races coming up at different tracks and I__ excited to go racing. It is a step forward. Now, everyone made a step forward. If you look at the entire grid, it__ extremely tight. So I think it comes down to fine tuning the car to every track. Within two-tenths, you probably have six or seven positions at the moment. Unfortunately, we didn__ do good enough in China, but we know the reasons why. That__ why I__ fully confident we__l be in the mix for the coming three races. No, I think honestly it__ an extremely tight field. As I mentioned, within two tenths you could go from the top of it to the bottom of it. Objectively, we had a very strong Bahrain test. Melbourne, Q3, fighting for points _ quite tricky conditions, Safety Cars didn__ play in our hands. And China felt like we didn__ extract everything from the package. Nonetheless, still finished 11th, which could have been a P9, but unfortunately with the car being slightly underweight, we didn__ score points. So I think honestly we__e confident. It__ only two races. We know what we__e got to do. We__e got to focus on ourselves and the work and just execute a strong weekend and we__l be in the mix. It__ going to be very tight the entire season and we__l have to make the best out of each single weekend. Absolutely not, because we know exactly why we didn__ get those points. Things could have been very different in Melbourne, with the last Safety Car we were in the points the entire race. We were in the fight in China and there was more performance to come from it. So no, I__ confident we__l get those points. Some other teams have been slightly more fortunate than us, but it__ a long season. We saw it last year _ we managed to come back very strongly. I believe we__e got a better car than we had last season and I__ not too worried. Obviously on paper, it__ nice to see yourself up there straight from the start, but let__ remember there are 24 races. Yeah, we spoke on the phone. Obviously, the way that I was also given this opportunity and just in terms of what didn__ quite work out and things that could have been different. I think he__ got the experience, he__ got the speed. I__e always backed him up. I__e raced against him and with him for two years. I__e seen his raw speed. I__e seen what he was capable of doing already back at the time. We can look back in 2021, all these years, I__e always said he was an extremely fast driver. So he__ got the speed. I think he__ got a strong character. Does it mean it__ going to be successful in Red Bull Racing? No. Can he be successful in Red Bull Racing? Yes. But it__ slightly more complicated than that. I just wish him the best. I__e shared my thoughts and my experience from my time there. Time will tell, but I think he__ definitely a very strong driver. And in Formula 1 these days, you__e got many strong drivers on the grid, so it__ not all down to your speed. There__ slightly more to it, but hopefully he can make the best out of this opportunity. I think he always had the raw speed. It was a little bit too hectic behind the wheel at times, on the radio. I think in that sense he__ matured enough in minimising the mistakes. It__ all a fine line between pushing right at the limit or over pushing slightly too much, which can be quite costly in Formula 1. And I think we__e tuned that line. Looking at the past few seasons, I think he__ been putting in very strong performances. Speed-wise, he always had it. But in just minimising those mistakes, which could have been quite costly at the time _ yeah. Well, I think ultimately more experience in Formula 1 is never a bad thing. So the more experienced you are, the better you are. The more understanding you have of the sport, of the impact of the teamwork, etc.
Whether it was the limitation? No, it wasn__. There was more to it at the time, but I__ not going to really expand into details here. But yeah, more experience in F1 _ you are a more complete driver. It__ better. You can__ deny that.",Japan,thursday,Alpine
George Russell,"Yeah, I mean obviously the first two races have been great _ two podiums _ and we couldn__ really have hoped for much more. I think we also have to be realistic. We are only two races into a long season and I don__ think probably Ferrari and maybe Red Bull have maximised their potential as yet. So we don__ want to get carried away thinking this is possible week in, week out. But we definitely know that if we do the best job to our own abilities, we__l be there in the mix. Yeah, I think it has. We know in qualifying we__e always been pretty strong. But I think it was quite refreshing in China to see that our race pace was also pretty decent and we were the second fastest team in China. There were a lot of positives to take away. We go to Japan, which was probably one of our worst races last year, so it__l be quite an interesting test to see if we__e improved the car compared to this time 12 months ago. Yeah, I mean, I know he__ always got my back to be honest. People like to say things publicly. I don__ read what is said in the press or on social media. So for me, I only found out about this this morning when somebody told me. Of course, it__ good to hear, but I know that he__ always supported me, had my back and believes in me. And that__ the most important _ what is happening internally rather than what is shown to the world. I know that I__e got everybody__ support. We__e in this all together. We__e all fighting for the same common goal and it__ an exciting moment for us. From my side, there__ no stress whatsoever regarding a contract. Ultimately, contracts are in place in Formula 1 and things change very quickly. I believe in myself. You have to perform and it__ pretty much as simple as that. And when it comes down to contract discussions, I think with us in the past, with Toto, it__ taken no more than 24 hours to have the conversation, and then it goes to the lawyers and we get something in place. So, there is no rush from my side, there__ no concerns, there__ no pressure. I__ enjoying where I__ at in the sport right now and enjoying my performance and just enjoying going racing. That__ the main priority right now. Ultimately, from my side, I__ just going in every single weekend trying to perform to the maximum. These last three years as well, alongside Lewis _ his name was always there with championships because he__ the GOAT. But the last three years, neither of our names were there because we weren__ in the position to fight. Look, this season it__ been a great start to the year. I don__ think we could have achieved a better result than we expected, and I hope we can continue this sort of run of consistency. But we know realistically the McLarens are exceptionally strong, and I think it__ going to be challenging for anybody else to compete with them. But you know, we saw last year how dominant Red Bull were, and suddenly they weren__ at the end of the season. So yeah, things change quickly. I mean, not really, to be honest. I__ going in every single weekend. I__ a Formula One driver living my dream. It__ not what the perception is _ it__ what the reality is. The reality is if we__e going to fight for a championship this year, we need to improve. This year has been a great start to the season. But the same way the last three seasons have been, I feel that I__e personally performed very well. I__e had one of the strongest teammates ever. I__ not looking for external recognition. I__ just looking to go racing every single weekend, perform, and doing my job. Yeah, I think McLaren__ strengths are on the hot races and the old tarmacs where there__ a lot of degradation. So China, we saw the one-stop being quite straightforward. Who knows this weekend with the new tarmac _ obviously we don__ want to jump to conclusions. But what we saw in Melbourne and in Bahrain testing was pretty exceptional. And in Melbourne, it was more normal, but if that__ their worst race, it__ a bit concerning for the rest of us. But as we said after six races last year, Red Bull dominated and then things changed quickly. So, let__ hope there__ something similar like that, and we__e the ones who can come forward.",Japan,thursday,Mercedes
Yuki Tsunoda,"Really looking forward to it. Can__ be crazier than this, I guess, this situation. First race in Red Bull Racing and on top of it, a home Grand Prix. I think it's the best situation ever. I__ just excited. Simulator went well. I spent a few days in Tokyo, which was really busy, but at the same time I was able to spend it with friends as well. So yeah, really good so far. Well, I can't say specific details, to be honest. The first call I got was from Christian Horner after China, saying maybe be prepared, things might change a little bit. That was around Monday or Tuesday. I was in the UK for preparation for Suzuka _ that was already planned. I did a simulator session with Red Bull Racing, at that point it was just in case. Within two or three days in the UK, he confirmed it in person. So that was kind of the timeline. I can__ when specifically but that was the timeline. Yeah. I mean, in simulator obviously it__ not fully correct in terms of trickiness of the car, but at least it didn__ feel crazy tricky. I can feel what the drivers mentioned about the instability or lack of driving confidence. I did multiple set-ups that I wanted to try to make it better and those two days seemed pretty productive. I know what kind of direction I want to start and it seems to be a good baseline in terms of overall performance. So yeah, it was a really good simulator session. Yeah, I mean, that would be great. First race, home Grand Prix _ that__ obviously inside of my head, I would say more like a dreamer for rather than a target. It will be tough. I__ expecting it__l be challenging. It won__ be as easy as probably people think. It__ such limited time to adapt, and it__ a different beast as well. So I__l do my best and if I can go through Q3 and score points, I__ happy. It__ quite simple things, I guess. If you__e able to push with that car straight away above 95%, just for reference, you start to feel a bit of sliding front and rear. And you feel sliding, front and rear, once you start turn in you see the limitation. That__ kind of the sense I was trying to say. In Abu Dhabi tests, fortunately there are a lot of run-off areas, so I was able to push immediately, knowing that even if I pushed too much, there__ a bit of space to be forgiven. That__ why I was able to push straight away and felt OK with the car. I mean, RB20 historically has a big limitation with instability, and I think it was quite visible that as soon as you turned in, that characteristic was always happening. So probably even without pushing 100%, I already felt those things. I didn__ have any reference driver to know if I was driving fast enough or not to exaggerate that kind of limitation. But I think the RB20 was quite easy in that regard. It had enough limitation to feel that instability quite a lot initially on turn-in. First of all, I didn__ feel yet the exact trickiness that the drivers are saying. I have a bit of an idea from the simulator but it__ always a bit different from simulator to real car, so I__l see after FP1 if I either have to change set-up or_. But I don__ think I__l have to change my driving style because in the end so far it works well I guess with VCARB, otherwise I wouldn__ be here wearing this logo. So I will just do whatever I was doing previously and I__l just go step by step to build the pace and everything. Let__ see. Maybe I don__ have to do that. Maybe the car is straightaway good. I think Red Bull had pretty good performance last season, both cars, so I__ quite looking forward to it. He wanted me to be very confidential, so literally I didn__ call anyone. Even though I called _ well, I won__ say here _ I__ just kidding, I really didn__ say anything, not even to my parents. Actually, I told them maybe the day before the news came out. So that__ it. And yeah, I got a message from Pierre, that he wanted to call me about the experience he had in Red Bull, about the things he should have done in Red Bull and he wanted to share a couple of ideas he thought could work for the coming races in Red Bull. That was very nice of him and very useful tips. I also got support from Checo as well. All Red Bull family drivers gave me supportive messages. Those two have been very supportive to me, and I really appreciate it. They__e drivers I respect a lot, so I__ very happy. I didn__ get any specific number of races or time to prove myself. He__ been very supportive so far and just mentioned the expectations he has of me _ what he wants me to achieve. Pressure always comes once you hit the track. But for now, I feel really relaxed. It feels similar to when I was at VCARB. Once I entered hospitality, I was feeling the same, I was only thinking about breakfast. So far I__ not necessarily feeling pressure. Those things will come naturally, especially during qualifying in the home Grand Prix. But there__ not much point in feeling pressure. I__ feeling confident and hope I can do something different from other drivers. Basically, be as close to Max as possible, which anyway gives good results for the team, also it allows the team to support other strategies in the race. They__e clearly said the main priority is Max, which I completely understand, because he__ a four-time world champion and so far already in the last few races even in difficult situations he performed well. So to be as close a possible to Max. Also, to help the development as well with my feedback. They were very happy with my feedback in Abu Dhabi, so just continue that. But the main priority is to be close to Max _ which won__ be easy, for sure. Not really, to be honest. I think even if I tapped his shoulder and asked about the car, I don__ think he__ going to say the truth, you know? So I just try to discover it myself in the data, how he__ driving, also on onboard videos. I already checked multiple videos from him in the last two Grand Prix. Like I said, I didn__ feel the trickiness yet _ the clear trickiness of the car. I__l feel it myself, and I__ sure it also depends on driving style. It will behave a little bit different. Once I feel the car_ in my five years of experience, I believe that will give me some ideas to sort it out. And if I really struggle, whatever_ no, I still don__ think I__l ask him. I__l just try to discover it with my engineers. So far, they__e been very helpful. [My engineer] already gave some ideas about what kind of characteristics give drivers very little confidence. That information is already stuck in my head and it__ pretty clear. So I__l just see how it goes after FP1. Well, for me at least, it was brutal enough last year at the end of the season when they chose Liam over me. Yeah. It is what it is. I__ sure Liam also understands how quickly things can change within our structure. That__ one of the reasons we succeed, but also one of the reasons why we tend to get a little more attention with those situations. Yeah, I forgot the question. What was it? Sorry. I have confidence. I__ not saying I have the confidence that I can perform straight away like Max, but I have confidence that I can do something different _ hopefully _ compared to other drivers that will be in the car. If I didn__ have confidence, I wouldn__ be wearing this. I would have stayed in Racing Bulls. Racing Bulls already have such a good car, and I understand how they extract performance in every race so far but because I wanted to have a new challenge, and I have good confidence to challenge myself, so that__ why I__ wearing this and hitting the track with a different livery. Surprisingly, he didn__ call me yet. Very unusual. Not sure _ maybe he was busy with other things. I can__ wait to see him and see how he__ going to react to me. It__ very unusual. From F3, F2, F1 _ he__ always been calling me. But this is the only time he didn__. I__ sure there__ not anything from his side. Even in the last few races, we__e still had a good relationship. We didn__ have any moments between us. So yeah, let__ see how he arrives at the track and yeah, we__l see him in person. Yeah, for sure more than last year. It__ good to feel those things _ as a home driver, it__ always good to see that motorsport in our country is getting more and more attention. And I guess on top of it, this week I__ wearing Red Bull Racing colours and going to race with Red Bull Racing. Last year there was a collaboration between Honda and Red Bull, and obviously Honda is from Japan. We are big fans of Honda. Everything comes together. So far, the fans seem very excited and for me as a Japanese, I__ very happy to see that.",Japan,thursday,Red Bull
Charles Leclerc,"I__ confident because whenever you make mistakes, you learn from them, especially when they cost that much. Everybody plays with the limit and tries to be as close as possible to it. But to have both cars underneath it was a big pain. We didn__ need that. It__ been a very difficult first part of the season. The first two races were difficult, the pace was not where we expected it to be, and to lose even more points than we already did with that, it hurts the team a lot. I__ confident we__e learned from it. Whenever these kind of events happen we try to understand and analyse what went wrong and change a little bit the process. It was a multitude of things adding up, and the margin we took wasn__ big enough. It__ as difficult as always. It__ always tricky to extract the maximum. I don__ think it__ harder this season _ it__ just the performance compared to McLaren is just not good enough. It__ not about extracting the performance _ it__ just that there isn__ enough of it for now. But step by step, I__ sure and confident we can close that gap, starting from this weekend hopefully. We saw a big step on Saturday _ especially in the Sprint race with Lewis. On Sunday, I think it was back to normal. So I expect us to be more or less in line with where we were in China on Sunday and in Melbourne. Not yet. If we go back to last year, looking at the first few races, the situation in terms of performance was quite a bit worse than where we are now. We kind of expected Red Bull to dominate the whole season, and by taking the points that were available at the beginning of the season with the performance we had, we ended up actually fighting for the championship _ which was way above our expectations. There__ definitely not that feeling within the team at the moment. However, we do feel we haven__ maximized what we could have in the first two races, and that__ frustrating. But it doesn__ mean we cannot recover. The season is still very long. Small steps after small steps _ we can still have an amazing season. I won__ go into very specific details. I think we__e starting to understand the car and have some ideas where we__e lacking. In Australia, it was well understood. In China, Lewis did an outstanding job on Friday _ maybe some drivers didn__ put everything together in qualifying and he managed to do that and managed to outperform the car a bit. Then tyre degradation being a big thing. When you start in front, everything comes to you a bit more. But I think Lewis made a difference on Friday and Saturday, which in the second qualifying _ everyone was more up to pace _ we saw more of the real pace of the car. I think, very similar to last year, we have a good car in terms of race pace, but we couldn__ really show it until now. Whenever you start in the middle of the pack, degradation is worse, and you can__ really show your real pace. That__ what happened a bit on Sunday in China. So I think the pace is still as good as what we saw Saturday with Lewis. However, we can__ use it if we don__ have better qualifying pace. So if I take a step back that__ where we need to improve _ qualifying. It was the case last year, and this year it seems even more so. I can assure you it__ never a good thing to have a broken front wing, so it__ not something I want to target for the rest of the year. There were some interesting things we looked at to understand where the performance was coming from. I believe the performance was really strong in terms of race pace. I made some changes already on Saturday _ it was strong, especially at the end of the stint considering I was in traffic. Then we made some changes and took a step forward for Sunday__ race. So I think the overall pace was very strong. I believe it would have been stronger with a full front wing, but by changing the tools and adapting the driving, it didn__ have as much influence as we thought. But it__ still faster to have a full front wing.",Japan,thursday,Ferrari
Nico H_lkenberg,"One was good, successful. One wasn__. Pretty simple. But overall, it__ been more positive than negative. Getting the first points was a big thing for us and important. In China, especially Sunday, we had some difficulties _ it wasn__ really a representative race or result. But how things felt in the car and within the team were quite good, which makes me optimistic going forward. But as ever, things in the midfield are very tight and small margins can have a huge effect. We__l see. I think it__ tough. More or less, I see five teams _ ten cars _ sitting within a couple of tenths. The top eight spots are usually taken by the four big teams, so that doesn__ leave much on the table for the rest. But that__ the challenge _ that__ the job for everyone in the midfield. Whoever does a better job in the next weeks and months will come out on top. I was in Neuburg last week for the first time _ our power unit factory in Germany. It was very interesting to meet the people and see the facilities, to see what__ been happening the last two years and how much they__e pushing. That was quite cool. As for Henville, there__ still a lot of change happening. Still growing a lot _ upgrading infrastructure, people, facilities _ very much a work in progress.",Japan,thursday,Sauber
Oscar Piastri,"I hope so. No, it's been an incredible weekend from start to finish. The car__ been pretty mega the whole time. I think today was a bit of a surprise with how different the tyres behaved, but no, super... yeah, just proud of the whole weekend. This is what I feel like I deserved from last week. No, extremely happy. The team did an amazing job, 1-2 obviously. So yeah, very, very happy. Yes, I think on the Medium it was still a bit tricky, but much better than yesterday. And the Hard was a much better tyre than everyone expected, I think, or certainly than we expected. So yeah, to go all the way to the end like that was a bit of a surprise. But a happy surprise. So, very, very proud of the race we managed to pull off. It wasn't an easy one going in and yeah, just proud of the whole team and the weekend I've been able to pull off. Thank you. It's not a joke, by the way! I do have Chinese heritage somewhere. But no, thanks for the support. The crowd's been exceptional this week. There's a few too many Lewis Hamilton fans, but that's OK. We'll convert some of you next year, so thanks for coming out. The support__ been incredible this year, so I have really enjoyed it. Thank you. Yeah, very satisfying. Obviously, I think, you know, it's always a pretty good day when you cross the line first, that's obvious. But I think for me this has been the most satisfying, not just race, but weekend for myself.
You know, I think the two wins I had previously were very different, and I think this one's been the most complete. So I'm very, very happy with the whole effort of the whole team this weekend. I think we started with a car that was quick, but pretty tricky at times, and I think we did a good job of trying to tackle that. And to come away with this result is a perfect end to the weekend. I mean probably about 10_15 laps on the Hard. You know, I think already on the Medium it was easier than in the Sprint, but I think the Hard behaved much better than we all expected. I think George might have a different answer on that, but certainly for me, I went into it thinking it would be a two-stop and then even early in the race I still thought that, and was pleasantly surprised that the Hard was as strong as it was. A lot. I think we've obviously had a quick car this weekend, but like I said, it's not been as straightforward as it was in Melbourne. And I think, you know, to still have this result here is a really encouraging sign for us.
I think there's still going to be bumps along the road and things we can try and work on, but ultimately I think we're in a pretty happy place at the moment and, yeah, excited for the rest of the year. Yeah. I mean, I think we__e got different strengths and weaknesses as drivers. And I think this weekend there were certain points where it just worked a bit to my favour, naturally. And I think there__ been other weekends where it definitely hasn__, and I__e had to try and look at things from how Lando__ driven and apply them myself. I think that is definitely the advantage__r an advantage__e have. Having strong team-mates, you always learn from each other. It__ impossible to measure how much lap time you gain from pushing one another, but you do gain something, that__ for sure. So I think we always push each other, always learn things. I__e certainly learned a lot in the last couple of years. Maybe there were some things to learn the other way yesterday, but I think every single weekend we are learning one thing or another from each other. I mean, I think it's very, very early, clearly. But I think no matter how short or long the championship is, you need to maximise the car that you have every race. I think we saw last year that Verstappen was able to win the championship by capitalising on the car he had in the first part of the year. And he obviously did a good job through the rest of the year as well, but he built the gap when he had the ability to build the gap. And I think that__ an important thing at the moment as well, because you never know when someone__ going to find some speed with an upgrade or find something in how they operate the car. There are pretty fine margins out there. So yeah, I think you obviously want to capitalise whenever you can, but I__ certainly not thinking about the championship yet. As much of a clich_ as it is, it__ a clich_ for a reason, and I__ focusing on one weekend at a time because ultimately that is how you win a championship: by getting the most out of every weekend. I mean, I was very happy to come through Turn 1 in the lead. I would have been pretty annoyed if I wasn__.
So that was pretty crucial for the first part of the race, especially given that we didn__ really know if it was going to be a one- or a two-stop at that point. And how critical being able to dictate the pace looked yesterday in the Sprint__ was obviously happy to keep the lead. I think this weekend__ been maybe less emotional than the first two wins I__e had, but definitely more satisfying. I think it__ been a weekend where I__e been quite comfortable, been confident in what I needed to do and how I__e been driving. And I think the race today was_ I still had to push and keep my foot on the gas, because the gap, apart from the last few laps, was never that big behind. So I always had to keep on my toes, but I feel like I just managed the race well when I needed to, and pushed when I needed to. So yeah, just very happy with how the whole weekend__ turned out. I mean, I think saying I struggled a little bit last year is being pretty nice. It was a big turnaround this weekend compared to China last year. It was a track that I had a lot of homework to do from 12 months ago. Yes, it__ changed a lot with the resurfacing, but there__ still a lot of challenges around just the layout, regardless of the surface. So yeah, I think for me it__ been very satisfying to have probably my most complete weekend in F1 this weekend be at a track I struggled the most at last year. So very pleased with the hard work that not just I__e done, but the whole team around me. The engineers on my side of the garage, but everyone at McLaren__or firstly giving us a car that__ much stronger than it was 12 months ago here, but also being able to chip in where they can and try to help me improve. So I think it__ been a really nice show of progress in 12 months, but there__ still going to be challenges along the way. It__ just a nice confidence boost at the moment.",China,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Yeah, a few fun moments. The start, I was kind of hoping for exactly that, so Turn 1 went to plan. But then George got me on the pit stops and I was a little bit nervous, but our pace was a lot better in the second stint. So, tough race, just with the management, and I don't think many people expected a one-stop today. So it was good. Oscar drove well. He was quick the whole race. I tried to get close, but in the end just couldn__. It doesn't matter now, really, does it? It doesn't matter. He deserved the win and he drove very well all weekend. So I'm happy with second. It's good points. It's great points for us as a team with a 1-2. So a big thanks to everyone in papaya and yeah, just how we wanted the race to go, so very happy, yeah. It's scary. It's like my worst nightmare. You know, whenever I have a nightmare, it's when the brakes are failing, and I was losing 2, 3, 4 seconds the last couple of laps. So I was a bit scared, but we survived and we made it to the end. I would have loved to have given it a little try and put Oscar under a little bit of pressure, but not today. So we're satisfied. Great result and we'll go again next time. Tough race. Yeah. I mean, I'm just satisfied for the result, for the team. You know, 50th 1_2 for McLaren is quite an achievement, so happy to be part of that, first of all, and a great race by Oscar. I'm happy considering how bad my last few days have been and how much I struggled just to get comfortable and understand how to drive the car. To go to the pace I had today, which I think was very strong, it was a much better race than I was thinking I was going to have. I was not confident one bit and yeah, I was nervous that I was going to struggle just as badly, honestly. But very satisfied to know how much I've improved from a car point of view, from a driving point of view. Today was a much stronger day, so I'm more satisfied to know I've got answers for my struggles and yeah, that makes me happy. But I'm of course more happy for the 1_2 for the team. That__ stuff the team will know, and probably no one else, but we made a good amount of changes. Obvious ones, to try and improve the front end. I just can't drive a car with no front. I can, but I struggle, and it's just been too understeery, simply, the car, the last few days__ cannot maximise the package that way.
I think we both struggled a lot yesterday with that, and it shows that our pace today was from both of us a lot stronger than it was yesterday. So I think we're both still, as a team we__e still understanding this car and knowing its limitations, how to get the most out of it. But I feel like, especially for me, in the longer run stuff and even the short run stuff, I've not been anywhere near as confident as I would like to be, and I've not got the feeling from the car that I need in order to maximise the performance. But today was a much better showing of that and a much better understanding of it. So yeah, made some tweaks with the car, mechanically and aerodynamically, and it was a much better day today. So I'm happy with it. I think they started to go quite early. But, you know, you always get a bit of a tendency for the brakes to get a tiny bit longer. I think the team were hiding it from me because they saw the problem starting a lot earlier and they knew it was going to be a problem. But like the last 10 laps, I was pretty nervous about just being able to finish the race because it was noticeable how much worse it was getting every single lap and every braking zone. It's really not a nice feeling when you're in the car and you expect a nice solid pedal and there's just nothing and it goes to the floor. Doesn't fill you with confidence, especially on a fast track like this.
So we were lucky simply to finish the race and still to finish ahead of George. We were very lucky. I think the last couple laps were 3 or 4 seconds or more off. So we had a difficult ending and I would have loved to have pushed a little bit more and tried to give Oscar a bit of a run, but not today. So something we need to understand and make sure it doesn't happen again. I really hope not! No, no expectation of it. I think it was an issue that happened that shouldn__ have happened, basically. I think it was rapidly getting worse, probably quicker than the team were anticipating when they saw it. I think they saw it quite a bit earlier__ust after the halfway point of the race__ut then it was accelerating in deterioration. So whatever it was, I__ not sure, but it got critical in the last five laps.
So I think it__ a problem that shouldn__ happen, basically. And I__ sure they__l try and understand it and make sure it doesn__ happen again. Sure. I mean, Oscar said it well, honestly. Probably apart from Ferrari, I don__ think there__ another team that has two drivers that push each other anywhere near as much. And for us, that__ a huge advantage. Even if you have the same car for everyone, if you have a team with two drivers who can push each other, they__e always going to beat everyone else that__ just on their own. So we have a great car, we have a great team, but we also have two drivers that are pushing each other more than any other team has. And that will always triumph__ven [over] the best driver on the grid. That__ one of our biggest strengths at the minute__ow we__e able to learn from each other. Because of what Oscar said: we have different ways we drive. He wants some things on the car, I want different things. But normally our ways align and we always want the same thing in the end. Oscar__ ability to adapt to a track like this was impressive, and something I clearly struggled a lot more to do. I hate understeer. The one thing I almost hate as much as brakes not working is probably understeer, and that__ what we had this weekend. As soon as we put the Hards on, for instance, my pace was a lot stronger because I had some front finally. But yeah, I__e learned a lot this weekend from Oscar and his ability to adapt to these different situations. It__ definitely something we__l maximise because it__ helping us beat every other team at the minute. It__ a great car and two incredible drivers! And Zak. Absolutely. (Inaudible) I didn__ watch Formula One back then__t would have been 2007. Oh yes, Lewis and Fernando! You wait until he has a pit stop behind me and I__ not going to drive out. Or we__l have like a little multi-22 or something! No, I think we are [ready]. I mean, yeah, we were free to race today. I didn__ have the pace to really get up to Oscar, and he drove very well. So he deserved it. Same really last weekend. You know, yeah, there were those two laps that I know everyone loves to talk about where we just held position, but the rest of it, we were free to race. So I'm sure we__e going to have some closer racing at some point. I think we__e both excited__robably nervous and excited at the same time__s I__ sure the team will be. But we__e ready.
We know that as much as we work together and we have a good time and enjoy ourselves, we both know we want to try and beat each other and show who__ best. And that__ inevitable. So there__ no point trying to hide away from that fact or make something of it. We__e two competitors who both want to win. But we help each other out. I think we both achieved something better this weekend because of that fact. And we__l continue to do that. So I__ sure at the minute it__ going to be like that, but like Oscar said, at any point other teams can find something. Other teams have talked about upgrades and stuff already and they can catch up quicker than you think, just like we did last year. So as much as we__e doing that, we also have to think as a team and keep pushing the team forward from that side.",China,post-race,McLaren
George Russell,"Yeah, it's a great result finishing P3, especially in front of all these fans here. It's just been amazing support for everybody this weekend, so thank you so much for that. But yeah, really great race, really pleased with the P3. We knew the McLarens were a smidge quicker than us at a few crucial points, but well done to them. Yeah, I felt it from quite early on that a one-stop could be possible and it turned out to be slightly easier than we probably all anticipated. But nevertheless, the car__ been great this weekend. Probably one of my best weekends in Formula 1 in terms of the overall performance, so I__ really pleased with that, and just really maximising every single time out on track. So pleased again to be on the podium. I mean, Charles was putting me under quite a lot of pressure for a few laps after the pit stop, and obviously it was a bit dicey with Lando for a few laps, but from there on it was quite a straightforward race. I think just being fully maximised every time on track. Really happy with qualifying yesterday, getting in between the McLarens. And then the race today was really strong. Called it pretty early about the one-stop and it was a bit frustrating it was so clear in the end because I was hoping those guys ahead would have gone onto the two-stop. And we know at the moment we're trying our best to catch McLaren__hese guys are doing an amazing job. And for us to end up quite a bit ahead of Max and the Ferraris right now, that's a great result. Yeah, I think it was pretty vital. Obviously I lost out to Lando at the first corner. Oscar did a really good job at defending, and it's always a bit difficult when it's such a high-speed first corner. I thought I could sneak underneath him and he covered me pretty well. But for sure, if we qualified behind Max and the Ferraris yesterday, I don__ think we would have been standing on the podium today. So I think that was pretty crucial. I think their strength is probably in tyre management. And today we saw the one-stop was pretty comfortable. So let's see when we go to a circuit where it's much more overheating, like we saw in Melbourne on the Intermediate tyres or like we saw in Bahrain testing. They were even stronger. So they did an amazing job. These two have done a great job, and we need to keep pushing to close that gap. Congratulations to him. Yeah, I mean, we want to get the results obviously as a team and we__e working to try and catch up to McLaren. They__e the team to beat right now and we__e confident we can bring some performance, but they__e really doing an amazing job. We need to keep on scoring. The last two races, or the three races with the Sprint as well__he result we achieved was the maximum in all three. So that gives me a lot of satisfaction. And if we do deliver a car that is capable of fighting McLaren, I__e no doubt we can finish ahead, because we__e doing such a solid job as a team. So yeah, we need to keep on pushing.",China,post-race,Mercedes
Lando Norris,"Yeah. I mean, always disappointed if I'm not on pole, but Oscar deserves it today. He's done a very good job all weekend, so happy for him. His first pole in Formula 1, so it's always cool. Just a couple of mistakes again, kind of been my case this weekend, but the car was feeling a bit better today. I've got a lot more comfortable with the car, so a step in the right direction, especially from yesterday where I was struggling a lot and even this morning I was struggling a lot. A much better direction that we're going in. So yeah, not too disappointed. I mean, yeah, I've said that plenty of times. It's still quick enough. We__e never doubted it's the quickest car. It can just be a little bit feisty at times, but no, today it's not so much that. Today was just mistakes from my side and that's all. Yeah, we changed quite a lot on the car because we were nowhere and yeah, we worked quite hard to make some improvements into quali and then hopefully for the race tomorrow. So we'll see. I mean, it was tricky for everyone, I think. It's just tight and close, but it was a much better job than we did yesterday__nd I did yesterday. So the car was feeling much better and yeah, I was feeling definitely more comfortable. Still too many mistakes from my side. I'm not as comfortable as I was in Australia. Just tricky, but it is for everyone, and I just haven't done the best job__nd Oscar has done a very good job. So still a good result. I__ happy with P3, yeah. Just don__ qualify as far back. Yeah, I don't think it was so much run plan. I just think we didn't get as much out of the car yesterday. I obviously locked up and went straight. The car__ easily quick enough for pole, so I just did a terrible job yesterday. I think Oscar's shown great pace. I definitely haven't__specially from the race pace. And whenever we struggle with front graining, it's something I just struggle with a lot personally. So yeah, difficult for me. It__ been therefore a difficult weekend, just trying to deal with those things. It's something I'm not strong enough in. But yeah, I__e got a long, long night ahead of me to sit down and go through the data and see what I can improve for tomorrow. I mean, the layout is very different here to Australia__uch more medium-speed, high-speed corners. There's some slow speed too. That and just the car__he car is, I mean, we__e said it many times, it's definitely the quickest car, but it's still tricky to drive. We can easily do good sectors every now and then, but putting a lap together__ven like Oscar said, he was two-tenths down and then he's kind of going for it and it stuck. But it seems just tricky to understand how to do it consistently enough. When you do that kind of good job, then it can easily be the quickest car. So a couple of things, and just more my driving__ust that rhythm of knowing exactly what to do where, how much. Also, when you have the tyres and if you push a bit too much, the tyres can bite quite quickly too. So many different things, but also just Oscar's done a good job and I__e not done a perfect job. It's tight, so I just paid the price for not doing well enough. They said it.",China,post-qualifying,McLaren
George Russell,"It feels incredible, to be honest. It was one of the hardest quali sessions I've done in a long, long time and I was trying all sorts with my preparation, with the tyres, and nothing seemed to be clicking. Did something totally different on that last lap and it just all came alive and the lap was awesome. Just yeah, so, so happy to be P2. Oh, I mean I was going fast on the out lap, slow on the out lap, prepping the out lap_ it was just__nd the last one was a bit of a roll of the dice. Had a big moment at Turn 1, but it just all came together and I was really surprised when I crossed the line. I knew it was a good lap, but to see that I was between the McLarens__eah, just buzzing and looking forward to tomorrow. Yeah, it's going to be tough. I think the Medium tyre in the Sprint was really difficult. Obviously, I think most drivers will start on that at the front of the field tomorrow, and then the Hard__o one's ran all weekend. So nobody knows right now if it's going to be a one or a two stop. We know that McLaren are going to be quick, but we'll be doing everything to try and stay where we are or try and jump ahead of them. Should be a lot of fun. It was really, really challenging because the weekend has been difficult for everybody to get on top of these tyres and knowing what the best sort of strategy in the session is__f you go hard on your formation lap or do you take it easy? And I was just sort of going all over the place. And on the last lap, I tried something very different, it worked, really strong lap, and the P2 was a real surprise. So really pleased with that one. I just came out the pits and went dead slow round that warm-up lap ahead of my fast lap. So the first lap in Q3 I was full gas on that lap and it seemed OK__ think I was in P5, but two-and-a-half, three-tenths behind Oscar. And then found four-tenths on my last lap. Just really came together and it feels really rewarding when you do your best lap of the weekend when it matters. And to be in the front row is a really great place to start for tomorrow. I think we've known realistically anywhere from P3 to P7 is where we are on a given day. And you saw, I think it was only two-tenths to P6 between ourselves, Ferrari, Kimi and Max. And just to be between the McLarens, I__ really proud of the job we've all done to secure that. We know how quick they are. So anything more than a P3 is a big result for any team at the moment. I think that would be a bit of a stretch. Like Oscar said, it was a really difficult race this morning. I do think they're still a step ahead of everybody. Ferrari were a real surprise in the Sprint, but tomorrow__ a different game. And we've got the Hard tyre__obody's run that yet. So I expect a slightly different outcome. Yeah, like Oscar said, new surface__t__ super quick. Like here and like Jeddah, that__ like the gold standard of resurfacing that the drivers want because it's so enjoyable to drive and it's so quick. It's great for people watching. We clearly made a pretty good race this morning with the tyres and I think it__l be a good race tomorrow. So all in all, yeah, good news. Yeah, I mean the track__ like a bowling alley at the moment__uper smooth. Whereas last year it was all quite open and the tyres were degrading quite a lot. So that's always quite nice when you come here for the first year. Obviously, like in Turkey a few years ago, it didn__ go quite as well__ remember that was really nice and smooth. But yeah, much better than last year. What? Wow.",China,post-qualifying,Mercedes
Oscar Piastri,"I'm glad it looked like that because it didn't feel like that. I think, yeah, Q3__ust found a lot of pace. You know, Q1 and Q2 I was genuinely struggling and yeah, the car just came alive in Q3 and I think I came alive in Q3. So no, happy with what I did at the end. Even still, the laps were a little bit scruffy, but no__ery, very__ mean, I'm just pumped to be on pole. So very happy. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. I think with the new surface it's extremely grippy, which for us, you know, it's the best feeling in the world. The only thing that comes with that is when you lose grip, it bites at you. I think you've probably seen a lot of snaps, a lot of moments this weekend, and with the surface we've got it's pretty tricky. But when you hook it up, it feels pretty mega. So I'll take the fastest lap of Shanghai. Yeah, I mean, I think that is hopefully going to be a help. Just got to make sure I keep that clean air. But I was pretty happy after the Sprint. I think we did the most that we could have. I was pretty happy. You know, I would have been happier with one spot higher, but how the race turned out I couldn__ have asked for much more. So like, we learned a lot this morning and looking forward to trying to put that into use tomorrow. Yeah, I mean it means a lot. Been close a few times now and yeah, nice to finally have my first pole. I've had a couple of Sprint poles, but to have the first Grand Prix pole means a bit more. So yeah, pretty pumped, to be honest. I've worked hard for it and I feel like the start of the season has been strong. Obviously the result in Melbourne was a shame, but I feel like I've been doing a good job otherwise and yeah, just happy to have ended up on pole. Yeah, my first lap was honestly better than my second lap, but just at the hairpin at the end of the straight I lost a bit of time and didn__ do the best hairpin. And then the second lap I was about two-tenths down on myself, so I kind of just went, why not send it into the hairpin, and I gained those two-tenths back and then found a little bit more in the last corner. So yeah, honestly, without that, I was tempted to box before that. So I__ pretty happy now that I didn__, but it was__ just did a good corner, that__ all. I think our car was fast yesterday, it was just the run plan we went for in Sprint qualifying I don__ think was the best one in the end. I think today we knew that the session__ obviously a little bit longer so you can do two proper runs. So I think there were just a few things that in hindsight we could have done differently. And yeah, today I think the pace in the car has been more or less the same. We just executed it the way we should have. So yeah, I think it's been a good day overall. I think we learned a lot this morning. I think we learned a lot from Sprint quali yesterday to translate into qualifying this afternoon and yeah, happy that it__ worked out. I think just making sure your tyres survive is the biggest thing. I think we saw this morning that those that could__r I would say look after their tyres, but that wasn__ even really true__he people that could manage the best one way or another were the quickest. And I think for my own Sprint I felt like I did a reasonable job, it was just difficult trying to get past Max. But I think we saw with Lewis being out in front all morning, it probably helped him in the long run. So yeah, I think it__ going to be a pretty interesting race. It__ the most deg we__e probably seen and the most graining we__e seen in a long time. So it__l be interesting to see if it stays the same tomorrow. I mean, yeah, it__ always nice to go out there and represent my country. I can't say I think about it that much when I'm out on track, but it's always an honour to race for Australia. You know, the reception I had last weekend was incredible. Very lucky to have a race in my home country and my home city. But yeah, nice to be able to do it_ I'm a racing driver, so I'm selfish, so it's nice to do it for myself, but it is also nice to do it for Australia as well. Yeah, I mean we changed a few things. I wasn't perfectly happy with the car I had in Sprint quali and the Sprint this morning, so I was trying to make it a bit better for today__nd honestly probably more for tomorrow. But yeah, I__ not sure yet whether it was necessarily better or worse. I think it was maybe a small step better. I think the pace both days has been similar. It__ just been, as Lando said, quite tricky to get lap times out of it. Through Q1 and Q2 I was genuinely struggling and somehow found a lot of time in Q3 that I still don__ fully understand myself yet. So yeah, I mean I think even when you change things, you can__ turn the car upside down. It's kind of got its characteristics that you have to live with, especially on a Sprint weekend. The car was quick yesterday, it was quick this morning, you're not going to risk everything by trying to be half a second faster than everyone. So I think just some small things that were in the direction I wanted before the session and I__ not sure I want that now. But it did what I expected, at least. It's pretty much a completely different track in my eyes. We're a lot faster than we were last year. I think when you have this much grip_ Some of the corners here last year, I kind of left thinking, __f the track had a bit more grip, some of those corners would be pretty incredible to drive._ And this year, with this much grip, they are. They've done a really good job resurfacing it. I said in my interview__he only thing with these kinds of tracks is they're incredibly high grip whilst the tyres are pointing in the direction you want. As soon as you start to slide, it__ pretty difficult out there. I think that's not just been for us, it's been a similar story for everybody. We see it with a lot of the tracks that get resurfaced these days. So yeah, it__ been more fun to drive this year, definitely, but some very different challenges. The 1/16th heritage wasn__ a joke__hat__ real. They__e all here for me. They__e not here for Lewis__hey__e for me. Yeah, I mean it__ many generations ago and I definitely can__ speak Chinese and I__ not going to embarrass myself. But yeah, I think I__e definitely enjoyed coming here a lot more this year. I__e been able to see a little bit more of Shanghai. The weather__ been much nicer than it was last year. Everything is just going a bit better this weekend than it was 12 months ago. And yeah, the pole position is a really good confidence boost__t__ obviously my first one. So it's always nice to tick that box in a sense. But I think it's been a good start to the whole year for both the team and myself, even if the points tally doesn__ look like that at the moment. So no, happy with how things are going, and this is a nice step along the way.",China,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"I mean, if you look at it like that, I think it is positive. Of course, I tried to give it a go because I also had Oscar behind me pushing, so I was trying to keep in that DRS. You know, that helps a lot on the back straight. But unfortunately, yeah, I think the last 8_10 laps I would say we just didn't have the pace to the others, so I was just trying to survive out there. So I definitely take that P3. Even the cars behind were catching up quite a lot, so it was tough out there to manage your tyres somehow, but it's OK. We'll try to do better. We'll try to make it better. You know, we'll look into the data and see what we can improve a bit on the car. But I think in general we just lack a bit of overall pace and then of course, naturally, you have to push a bit harder, you kill your tyres a bit more, so that makes it very difficult. I would say like midway. You really started to feel that the deg was kicking in. Yeah, it just seemed a little bit more aggressive for us than maybe the cars around us. But I think that just comes from maybe also not having the base pace. You try to hang in there and you naturally just destroy your tyres a bit more. So to be in the top three, I think it's still a good result for us. I mean, we started a bit more ahead than I think we should have anyway, so I'm pretty pleased with hanging in. I think all of that. But it's the same for everyone. But for sure, I mean, the tarmac is very good. I like it. It has a lot of grip, but it does seem that we are struggling a bit more with graining. Pressures went up a little bit as well. Probably that made it a bit more difficult for everyone. So it will be, I think, a very challenging race also tomorrow.",China,post-sprint,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"Yeah, I think it was a productive Sprint. Obviously finishing second is always a great result. And yeah, I really learned a lot in that one. And I think, you know, as much as the result is a nice thing, the way I got the result, like you said, is an encouraging thing. So yeah, we didn__ quite have enough pace for Lewis out front, but I think we__e got some good ideas for this afternoon and tomorrow and see if we can go one spot better. Yes. Hopefully we don't have as much traffic though, that's the plan. So we'll see what we can do this afternoon to start a bit higher and go from there. But yeah, I think we've got good pace in the car. We've clearly got a lot of competition this weekend. The Ferraris look pretty rapid, so we've got to be on our best form. Yeah, tough. Probably one of the more difficult ones in terms of tyre degradation. So I knew I had to try and be patient. And yeah, I think I pretty much executed the Sprint that I wanted to. Probably one position short of what I wanted to do, but I think in terms of how I went about it, I was happy with the end result. So yeah, a pretty challenging race, but happy with it. Yeah, I think we've got some good ideas. The difference between qualifying and the race in terms of what you want from the car and what the tyres need seems to be quite big. So it's going to be a balancing act for sure, but I think we've got some good ideas on what we want for certainly tomorrow and even this afternoon.
I think the pace we had in the car yesterday was good. I think we just, in hindsight, would have done a few things a bit differently in qualifying. But I think the pace is there and there's plenty of confidence going into this afternoon.",China,post-sprint,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Oh, I mean, today I woke up feeling great. You know, the weather is beautiful here in Shanghai. And we have this amazing crowd. But yeah, the first race was difficult and obviously I really do feel a lot of people underestimated the steep climb it is to get into a new team, to become acclimatised within the team _ understanding and communication, all sorts of things _ and the amount of critics and people I've heard yapping along the way just clearly not understanding. Maybe because they never had the experience or just unaware. And so it felt great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car because in Melbourne I really didn't feel comfortable. From lap one here this weekend I was really feeling on it. We've done a great job _ the engineers have done a great job, mechanics have done a great job _ to really fine-tune the car. And it felt great. Today I got a good start, and then it's such _ it's so much grip on this new tarmac, it's really hard to look after these tyres. But I think everyone was struggling the same. I don't know. I mean, I don't feel the pressure. I know the Tifosi, I know the fans, I know the team wants to win and I know it means everything to them. But I said the other day, like, Rome wasn't built in one day. One step at a time. We're not going to get ahead of ourselves _ we cannot. We've got to continue to push, we've got to be diligent and just remain focused, stay calm. Most importantly, stay calm, because these moments get us all excited. But we'll be back at our desks after this and focused on qualifying this afternoon. And you know, it's a long, long way. So it's a marathon, not a Sprint, right? So we just got to take our time. Sorry, we were just getting... I haven't been up here for a while, so it's a little bit new. It__ been a really, really special weekend so far. Like, you know, China, Shanghai has always been really good to me since my first race here back in 2007. It's a track that I really do love driving on. It's got so many great challenges throughout. It's one of the best new layouts that, or new tracks, that they've built over the last couple of decades. But yeah, to arrive today, it's a much different view, starting from pole. It's been quite some time since I've had that view. So I got in the car extra early because I just wanted to be present and enjoy it because I haven't been there for a while. Good start. Challenging race. I think it is generally really close between all of us, but the tyre degradation today was pretty huge, I think, for everybody. So I think for me it was just trying to manage that early on and then... Yeah, the last like five laps or something, I was in a really pretty comfortable position. Yeah, I just... it's hard to put into words what it feels like. Obviously it's a Sprint race. It's not the main race, but even just to get that is just a good stepping stone to where I'm working towards. Yeah. The car was feeling really good today. Hopefully we'll make a couple more changes to improve the car going into qualifying this afternoon. And yeah, we won't change too much. We've got a pretty decent platform so far, so definitely feeling good. But as you saw yesterday, qualifying was incredibly close between the top three and I don't think Lando got his lap, so it will be very difficult again this afternoon. But we'll give it everything. Yeah, I think... I don__ know, it's just like every time you get in the car, you're learning more. I would definitely say last week, for whatever reason, I really didn't feel comfortable in the car. Friday_ Saturday was a little bit better. But I think set-up wasn't where I really wanted it to be. And I think really last weekend I still am sitting back and letting the guys do what they do. I need to observe how they like to operate, rather than imposing _ because maybe what I've done in the past won't work. So I've just been basically in that area. And then coming into this weekend, straight away on Monday, I hit Riccardo up and said; ""These are the things that I want to start with this weekend. This is more the direction."" And I'm much happier with that. That's something I tested back in Bahrain and we kind of veered off from there. So there__ been a couple of changes. But yeah, from the moment I started driving yesterday, I felt more one with the car. And even through this race, I'm still learning. I didn't get to do the long run in Bahrain. I didn't get to do the race run in Bahrain. So the race last week in the wet was my first long run in the car. So that was actually my first proper long run of any significant amount of laps. I'm learning along the way still, just how this car, how to manoeuvre the tools in order to make the car work the way I want it to work. So I'm really happy with how it came out, given that that is the case. But now I've got a much better knowledge now of what the car likes and what I need to do to make it faster. Well, yeah, I mean, I'm not really talking back to them or anything like that. It's just that we live in such a strange time in the world. People just love to be negative at any opportunity, even with the smallest things, they__l just be negative about it. And I think that's just the difficult time that we're living in. I see certain individuals _ and again, I don't read the news, but I see bits here and there _ see people that I've admired for years just talking out of turn. Clearly some of them really just making uneducated guesses of what's going on. And like I was just saying, just a real lack of appreciation. It's not easy moving to a new team that works completely differently, completely different characteristic of car. You don__ just jump in and it's good. I mean, look at _ it's true _ if you look at Seb, you look at Fernando, they did a great job when they joined the team in their early phases, but to build long-term success with the team takes time to build. And that's what I'm trying to do. I'm not trying to jump-start it, get ahead of myself. I'm just taking my time to build with this great team. There's so much potential in this team, but for us to be at the second race already and have that experience _ this is a track I've gone well at for many, many years, so you got to take that a little bit. But in general I've been feeling really good in the car. And as I'm learning more of where the car likes to be set up for a track like this, for example, when I get to another track like the last one, I think I have a better understanding of where to put it. Well, I felt unusually calm in myself. I would say definitely more so than usual. I'm generally a relatively calm person, but I think today there was a stillness in me that I haven't felt for a long time. I didn't know if that was going to be a good or bad thing _ if I'm dormant or just ready. But also, I've got_ Ange and I, it's her first... you know, Ange is still getting used to things. This is her first Sprint for ages, so even for her, we came to the grid and we happened to be there a little bit early... You know, like, shoot, we were earlier than normal. Yeah, just the timing, I was like, I'm going to get in the car. And it actually worked really nice. I got time to spend talking to the engineers from the car. I think really from the moment _ the good start that I had, I was really happy with the start _ and then a couple laps in, I felt that I was managing. So I felt like I had the car beneath me. But of course, the two behind were pushing quite hard, and I could see Max was getting close in certain places, so I didn't know. And also the graining actually started appearing quite early. I don't know how it was for you guys, but already four or five laps in, you could kind of already see it, even though we were managing. So I didn't know where that would go. But the fact is I think all of us were experiencing the same thing.
So once I got calm there, kind of like after lap six or seven, I kind of got into my stride and that was that. Well, I think it's just... Look, we__e just come from a race where we finished 10th. So there are so many factors to really take into account. So I guess we just can't get ahead of ourselves off that one result that we just had and be like, yeah, now we're... The car felt good today. And yes, managed to finish ahead of a McLaren and a Red Bull. But that doesn't necessarily mean... You know, look at qualifying, it__ very, very close. So not making the mistakes is going to be key. But I think we seem to be there or thereabouts this weekend, which is really good. I hope that that continues. But again, from track to track, we'll have to wait and see. We saw last week we didn't have that. So I'm hoping that, you know, there's a lot of learnings from last week that we applied already to this week and the car has been in a much better place. So I hope that we can keep it there. And if we can, then yes, that makes me happy.",China,post-sprint,Ferrari
Fernando Alonso,"Yeah, difficult to know exactly. I think qualifying was OK for us. I think until the damage in Q2, we were competitive. But then in the race, I think it was difficult to judge the performance of the cars. I think we just followed the car in front more or less, took care of the tyre, waiting for the dry track to come. And yeah, it was a game, if we could say that. So yeah, I think we have to wait a few races, different track layouts _ Suzuka as well, Bahrain with the slow-speed corners. So I think after four or five races, we will have a better idea. I don't know. That we had a little bit more pace than the cars in front, probably, but it was very difficult to overtake. It was only one very narrow racing line to be able to overtake. And yeah, the tyre deg was big, but when you follow cars, it's always big. As I said, I think we have to wait and see. It was an interesting first race. Pace in qualifying was maybe better than expected _ better than what we saw in Bahrain. The race was tricky, it was difficult for everyone, but the outcome was eight points for the team thanks to a very good race from Lance. All in all, it was a good first race for us. I don't know. I think we started a little bit stronger last year, especially in quali, so it__ definiteky going to be a bit more difficult. We were P3 in wet and P3 in dry with the two qualifyings here. I think it__ going to be a challenge to repeat that kind of result, but we will try our best and try to score the first points for me of the year. Looking forward to it _ this is one of the best layouts of the year, one of the best race tracks for us as drivers in the championship. So yeah, looking forward. Very impressive, very good, but no surprises. He__ the best of the new generation _ together with Ollie! And yeah, I mean, he's well prepared. He worked really hard all winter long, and I think Melbourne is not the easiest track to make your debut. The race especially was super tricky for everybody, so it was a hard test, but it was very impressive _ the first of many. I don__ know the exact details, so difficult to comment, but I think Melbourne is not an easy track to recover cars. At some point, they need to go onto the track. I think we have a different system now than what we had in the past. Even behind the Safety Car, in a yellow flag zone, you have to respect a slower lap time. So, if you respect that time, you should not be too fast in that zone. I understand the sense of the question, but I don__ think there was anything crazy. I think it was under control. Both probably! I mean, it__ a privilege to keep racing and doing what I love, which is racing cars. I__e been lucky enough to race and experience many different eras of the sport, and I__ still here. I still feel competitive, motivated, and fresh enough to travel around the world and race these cars. Most importantly, I still feel competitive. If one day I feel that I__ not fast enough or that I__ struggling on the pace, I will be the first one to say I__ not enjoying it anymore. I__ an ultra-competitive person. That__ the most important thing for me. I made my debut in 2001. I raced the first-ever Chinese Grand Prix here in 2004, and now, in 2025, I__ still here, and I__ as fast as 2004. This is what I feel. Or faster now. Maybe it__ because we have better tools now and more possibilities for drivers to improve ourselves and tweak some on the weaknesses we have in our career. But yeah, I feel privileged to still be here. I think there are clear rules that I stay in front! That__ my understanding! No, jokes aside, it__ great to see Gabriel__ career so far. For us at A14, we feel extremely proud of the relationship. This year is going to be the first year he__ not winning, so we have to maybe accept that. But it__ part of his learning curve. For me, it__ a bit different. All the advice and insights I__e given him over the past two years _ it__ a bit strange now because I__ giving him the same, trying to help him as much as I can with experience of circuits , preparation, how to approach race weekends, marketing activities, the way to spend energy, save energy _ all those kinds of things. I don__ think this is affecting any the performance. At the end of the day we rely a lot on our teams, our cars, and our packages. I don__ feel like I__ giving away something magic and someone will benefit. I__ just trying to apply common sense and help him perform when he puts the helmet on, which is the most important part of Formula 1. I think it__ working fine and will continue to do so. I__ not sure. It__ difficult to comment. Obviously, I love the V10 era and the V8 and the sound of those cars that we all miss. At the same time, we__e in a different world now. Technology has evolved, and we now have incredibly efficient engines that use about one-third of the fuel we used to. That__ more a decision for the top management will take _ FOM, the FIA, and the manufacturers. As drivers, we just want to race the fastest cars possible, regardless of the engine. Maybe the fans have something to say as well. But we also can__ just go against our time and our hybrid era. We cannot forget how efficient the cars are now compared to the past. This is something very positive that we have. It__ like saying we could run without the Halo and make the cars more dangerous and more adrenaline for the fans. It doesn__ make sense. We move on from certain things, and what we have now is a very good Formula 1 and a very good moment for the sport so difficult to invent something that we could go into the unknown. Difficult to know. We haven__ spoken in detail yet. Obviously, we__e all been very busy _ from the Bahrain test to Australia, then straight to here in China. When we go back to the factory, hopefully, we__l have more time to sit down properly. But I know he__ really motivated, and he__ fully involved in everything that__ coming for 2026. He__ also looking at what we__e doing every weekend. I__ definitely looking forward to working with him. I know his thinking , I know his approach for the last years, we__e be talking for many years, we__e been together last year at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, we had lunch together. So I know what he__ capable of, and I__ excited for the future. Do you remember what I told you? There will be no grip, you will be surprised to_",China,thursday,Aston Martin
Gabriel Bortoleto,"Yeah, he__ being nice because there__ cameras, you know! No, I__ grateful for everything A14 has done for me. Not only him, but Alberto and Albert through these last two years already that we have been working _ F3 and F2 _ and they have been very cool and supportive in the junior series. Fernando obviously with all the advice, helping me to step up to Formula 1. So yeah, thanks for the words, and I will keep working very hard and trying to do my best. It__ just the beginning. I__ happy about the way we started, but there is a lot of work still to be done and a lot of development from my side as well. I mean, through the whole weekend, I think it was very solid. Quali was good, FPs were very solid as well. I improved a lot through the sessions. Quali _ I managed to do a decent lap in Q1 and then tried a bit too hard in Q2. But yeah, in the race, it was very tricky. I__e heard from some drivers that there won__ be many races more difficult than this one in your career _ slicks to wet, then wet to slicks again, dry, then wet again. So a lot of things happened, and we take learnings from that _ how to behave in a race like this, when to push, when to not push, when to take risks. And obviously, through the race as well, we had some fights around, and it was just good to understand a bit how racing in Formula 1 is. Well, I think we are back a bit to F2, with just one practice, so nothing much I can do about it__ust less practice, less time to understand. But we will give our best and try to make as many laps as possible in FP1, understand the track, and try to make a decent lap in Sprint quali. But yeah, I'm excited. It__ nice to race and feel again the racing of Formula 1 because like this I can be more prepared for Sunday as well. Same, to be honest. I agree, the double yellow area, that you need to follow the delta, and you go very, very slow there. If the stewards decided like this, for sure, they were keeping an eye on it, after what happened in the past. They wouldn__ try to make a mistake like that again. Well, regarding the brake problems, I stand by what I said during the whole race. Whoever was [listening to] my radio or watching the race knows I was complaining about the brakes from lap one. I had a problem _ it was clear. I__ not going to go into detail about what exactly it was, but we had an issue. As for the suspension, that__ a question we are still struggling to fully understand what happened there. What is clear for us is that there was contact, I think with Nico. It was a racing incident _ it was a very small contact in Turn 3. We were side by side, and he had a small snap and touched my rear tyre. I didn__ even feel it at the moment, but when we rewatched the race, we saw it. So maybe that__ one of the possibilities, but there__ nothing conclusive. The team is still studying and analysing it back at the factory to try to understand the real reason why it broke. We also need to determine if it influenced my spin the corner before or if that was purely my mistake from hitting the kerb. Yeah, I think the amazing five, six seconds Turn 1, the long one! I__e driven the track a bit in the simulator. It__ a cool track, high-speed, medium-speed corners. It__ a bit of a mix,. They__e resurfaced it as well, so hopefully it__ better in terms of bumps because that was an issue for some drivers last year. Excited to drive here. Looks a very nice ambience, atmosphere. A nice track. Regarding the rules, I have in my contract that I need to give him a slipstream every time I see him in quali! No, but as Fernando said, he__ been very good. He__ been able to teach me a lot of these things _ how to maximise my performance on track by managing my efforts outside of it. Things like how to handle the days here, Thursdays and Fridays, to be focused on what really matters during the weekend. It__ been very nice so far. In Australia, we didn__ really get to fight each other properly, but hopefully, in China, we can have some side-by-side battles. That would be nice for me. I__e watched him my whole life racing, and now racing against him in Formula 1, with him also being my manager, it__ going to be very nice. A good opportunity. Yeah, I__ keeping the panda__t__ very cute! Honestly, I didn__ expect that many fans to be waiting. First of all, because I__e never been to China before, so I didn__ know what to expect or how many fans of racing there are here. Obviously, when Zhou is here, it__ one thing, but for a Brazilian guy who__ never raced in Formula 1 before, I wasn__ expecting such a warm welcome. It was super nice to see. Even in the hotel lobby, you can see there are a lot of fans. It__ great to be racing in a country where people are so passionate and respectful. Well, we spoke briefly, I think, just on the drivers_ parade. Yeah, you told me,  __orrible race_. He told me __ust survive_. And then both of us died! Yeah, exactly! Fernando mentioned the lines on the track,. I think a lot of the drivers talked about it in the briefing as well. It was very slippery. We tried to keep it on track but it was very tricky conditions there. Leave it there, it__ all good! Yeah, as Ollie said, we have a good relationship, but when we__e racing, we__e racing. We__e all been very clear about that. I__ not as close to the other rookies, to be honest _ I__ probably closest to Ollie. But I do want to see the rookies doing well because it shows that our generation is strong and capable of delivering in Formula 1. Australia was a tricky weekend for all of us, but we have much more to show than just that weekend.",China,thursday,Sauber
Oliver Bearman,"Yeah, I mean, Sprint weekend, new track for me. It will be an interesting one. The track looks awesome from the simulator and from the onboards I__e seen, so I__ really excited to drive here. It will just be important to get up to speed quickly and already be there for Sprint qualifying. Yeah, I think race one was a bit of a surprise for all of us within the team, about how uncompetitive we were. We have a few pointers now as to why that was, particularly in the race. We were a bit out of the window of performance, so we have a few ideas now heading into Shanghai. Unfortunately, not enough free practice sessions _ not the best time for us to have a Sprint weekend, but we__l see what we can do. I__ sure it will be a much better one. Yeah, I agree with everything they said. At the speed we were going, it was OK. But yeah, I understand the sense of the question. Yeah, not enough laps for me heading into the race. Disappointing that the weekend turned out that way. I was quite glad to have the rain on race day _ it kind of levelled the playing field a little bit because I hadn__ done any dry laps. That completely shifted my mindset, and it became all about surviving on Sunday. There were so many DNFs that day, super difficult conditions, going through the track drying and with all the white lines, it was a bit of a minefield out there. So, it was really about surviving and quite different mindset from the rest of the weekend. Yeah, it__ quite easy to move on. They were small mistakes with big consequences, which is just a feature of that track _ it__ a bit of a sketchy one on the calendar. I should have approached the sessions differently for a track like that, where there__ no margin for error. Now, I__ just excited to get onto a new track. That__ always fun in these amazing cars. And actually get into a full weekend without any of those issues. I think it__ nice to have other drivers going through the same situation. Myself, Kimi, and Gabriel__e__e quite close, having raced against each other last year. It__ good to know that we__e not alone in this. We have a good relationship, which helps.",China,thursday,Haas
Lando Norris,"No, no. I actually went to Taiwan for a few days. Just relaxing and recovering, getting ready. Nothing to celebrate about. So yeah, just a few days to get ready for Round 2. I mean, I'm hoping we can do better, and I'm hoping it can be a bit easier. I think we had a great race. Our gap to our competitors half way through the race was, you know, 15 seconds or something. More likely, there were some Safety Cars that kind of brought them back into the race. But we're hopeful. It's a different weekend, so I wouldn't say we're confident that things are going to be exactly like they were. I expect a bit more competition from Ferrari this weekend. And we saw how quick Red Bull have been, so clearly, they__e not out of it. They__e just as fast. I think when things are perfect, like they were in qualifying, we have an advantage, but they__e certainly not far behind. I mean, I think as a driver, you__e always at the limit of your car and what your car can do, so you__e always trying to look at places to improve I guess I__ trying to look at things I can do better. My start was good__t wasn__ perfect, no__ut it was clear where I lost some of my performance in the launch. And then, just from a car point of view, the car is performing well, but it__ still extremely difficult to drive. We know in certain conditions, like in the wettest conditions, Max was just as quick as us. In dry conditions, we were a bit better. So just making the car a little bit more predictable and a little bit more comfortable. But it__ at a good point__ can__ complain about the whole thing. It__ at a good level, but between Oscar and myself, there are things that we both comment on, which gives the guys and girls back in the factory a clear direction on what we want to improve. The car__ great, but we always want more. Nope. Yeah, I said it in an interview already__t makes no difference to me at the minute. I__ not thinking about it. I don__ really care about it. It shouldn__ change anything I do. It shouldn__ change what the team does. I had one good weekend__eople need to calm down a little bit. I__ focused on trying to do the same here. I probably won__ even think about the championship until at least halfway through the year. Nope. We don__ have to change anything. Ours is fine. In fact, ours was probably too good, and we probably weren__ pushing the limits enough, honestly. If this technical directive had been applied last weekend, we would__e been fine. It__ not directed at us__t seems to be directed other teams. Yeah, which probably means we should push it a little bit more. I think, in general, some of the traits are the same. It still doesn__ suit my driving style at all. I think I__e almost gotten to a point where I__e just accepted that you can__ have a perfect car that suits your style. Maybe it suits some people, but I__e kind of stopped asking for exactly what I want and more just focused on whatever makes the car quicker. It__ probably a tricky car to drive and to put together a lap, but clearly, it__ taken a step forward from last year. At the end of the day, my job is to drive whatever car I get given. That__ why I__ here. That__ why McLaren wanted me. They believe I can drive it better than others can. Half and half. It__ similar characteristics and some of those characteristics I don__ like and don__ suit the way I want to drive, in an attacking way. It doesn__ suit me in terms of me wanting to push the entries and push the braking. It__ very weak, I would say, from that point of view. Not what I like but at the same time some of it is down to the adaptation, needing to change my driving style every year, because the car I drive is very different to what McLaren was a few years ago, clearly, because then we were at the back and now we__e at the front. But some things carry on. Some things are like _ this is a McLaren_ for those reasons and I__e only ever driven McLarens, so that__ all I know. I think it__ unique in certain aspects. Obviously we have our strengths and weakness and whenever someone has been at McLaren and gone to another team they have often said how hard or odd the McLaren has been to drive, whether that__ Daniel or with Carlos. It__ also like all I__e got used to, so I__e got to the point where I__l just drive whatever car I have to drive as long as it__ fighting for a win and quick enough to fit for a win, I__ happy enough to drive what I__ given. I think the thing is, the aero guys and girls back in the factory they just try to find lap time. You__e got to balance how you work the car. Like certain other teams have said, at times you can try to find a more peaky aero balance. If it works at the peak, it__ better, but it might be trickier to drive and worse in windy conditions. Or do you try to get rid of some of that peak grip and make it a slightly more all-rounded car? You have to play with this balance, because it__ difficult to get both. You have to choose what direction you want to go in. And definitely, I think some of what I want from a car is first of all just very hard to get. That__ probably the best answer. For me, a good front at apex, that__ kind of all I feel like I want. But I very rarely have what I need from that perspective. But the car can still win races. It__ not like if I don__ have what I want, the car is bad. I can still get the most out of the car, if I don__ have what I want. There are just compromises. It__ so complicated when the guys and thew girls try to take you through_ If I do want more front end at mid-corner, at the minute we can only get that if we compromise low-speed or high-speed performance, or making the car more sensitive to windy conditions. There are so many compromises you have to make and at the end of the day, you just want the best all-rounded car. I think that__ the main answer to it all. I think I__e got a better understanding of that over the past couple of years on driving styles, how I need to drive the car.  Maybe making a bit of that switch from __ want this from the car, and I want to keep driving my way until you make it more suited me._ I guess  I__e kind of thrown that away and just said, __lright, give me the best car, and I need to adapt a lot more to the car I get given._ It__ not the most comfortable, it__ not what I like the most, it__ now what I can get the most out of but over the last year and a half, I__e probably learned more about my driving than I did in the previous five years, just because the car has changed, and I__e fallen into this philosophy of give me the best car and I__l adapt to that rather than give me the car I want. Yeah, so I didn__ really know about it because they said it to Oscar, not to me. And it was literally just for two or three laps as we went through the backmarkers. It was risky conditions, and we__ look like complete idiots if we attempted to race and both ended up off the track__r worse, out of the race__hen we had a great result in hand. It was just for a couple of laps that they asked us to hold position, and then he was free to race again. We were free to race all the way up until that point, and then there was just a holding period for a few laps. After that, it was back to normal. I think that__ all I really knew about it. I__ sure we__l talk about it more__e even had a little chat about it this morning. But yeah, from the team__ perspective, it wasn__ about me or Oscar, it was about McLaren _ we__e first and second, let__ not do anything silly when we don__ need to. There__ still a lot of opportunity left for Oscar to race me, and it would have been stupid to try and force a situation when we__e behind backmarkers, blue flags. If you go offline at that part of the race, you__e in the wall. At that stage of the race, I was still trying to think I need get these tyres to last until Lap 54 or whatever. I think Oscar was just pushing a bit more and trying to get past me. But yeah, it was all comfortable from my side. Definitely. The gap in qualifying surprised us a bit. Our goal was to be on pole, and we expected to be quickest, but we also expected Ferrari to be a good chunk quicker than they were. In the end, they were what__even, eight tenths off? They__e not that far off by any means. If you looked at FP1, FP2, FP3, their pace never looked that far behind. All of Ferrari__ race runs on Friday were a lot closer to us than anyone else. In fact, I think Ferrari__ race pace on Friday was maybe even better than ours. So we were surprised. I__ sure they seemed a bit shocked as well by why they were so far off in the race. But it just shows how difficult it is to predict. One weekend, everything is going well, and the next, it can turn upside down. You saw how quick Max was at the end of the race. Even at the start, in the first five to seven laps, and then again in the last five to seven laps, Max was just as quick as us. But in that middle period of the race, when you have to understand the tyres and know how much to push, we seemed very strong. That__ when you need a well-balanced car in drying conditions so the tyre degradation happens evenly, rather than the front wearing out more than the rear or vice versa. Also, there__ a good amount that Oscar and I have learned from each other about how to drive the car efficiently. That__ an advantage__ot every team has two teammates who can really rely on each other and push each other forward. It__ something we__e worked on at McLaren, and I think it__ paying off.",China,thursday,McLaren
Alex Albon,"No, not really. I think getting ahead of the Ferraris in qualifying, yes, but I think we always considered ourselves to be the best of the midfield. I__ actually say, on the other side, the RBs and Alpines were maybe a bit closer to us than we would have liked. But that__ a great issue to have. I think we__e been a bit more comfortable generally with the car this year. The feeling of the car is much better, and even though there is a bit more downforce, I think it__ just a bit more usable, and that__ where we__e getting a bit more confident with it. Truthfully, I think the race car is better than the qualifying car. We__e put more attention into the race car this year. Our long-run pace in FP2 was very strong in Melbourne relative to the midfield. We still have a clear gap to the top teams, but it__ always the case when the midfield teams seem to be a bit slower comparatively to the top teams in the race and in qualifying. It was a shame we couldn__ use that, especially because of how Sunday__ mixed conditions played a part. Maybe we__l see it here in China with a bit more consistent weather, because that__ actually where I think our car has improved the most. Yeah, I mean, firstly, Carlos is pushing me both on and off the track. In terms of his expectations of the team and where he wants the team to go, it__ definitely something I__ very interested in. He__ obviously got a lot of experience from Ferrari, and he knows where the team needs to improve. So for me, there__ definitely a feeling that I__ also learning from Carlos. In terms of pure pace and driving, yes, it__ a different atmosphere within the team. We__e pushing each other, but I__ really enjoying it. I feel like when you can look at things and study things in detail, it__ more about just putting laps together rather than anything else. I think it__ more his approach to perfection and wanting the team to improve. I__e been in the team for over three years now, and there are moments where you kind of settle and accept as time goes on, and you focus on some areas where you know there are weaknesses in the team, but you kind of lose that constant __aggingness_ you get when you__e fresh into a team. I remember my time at Red Bull and when I came into Williams, it was immediately, __his and this and this need to improve._ Whereas now, it__ kind of like, __ell, I know this is how it is, and I need to focus on these areas._ I think in that sense, Carlos is pushing us. He__ kind of brought me back to focusing on areas that I shouldn__ settle on and should push the team forward. Our goal, at the end of the day, the end of the year, is to become a top team heading into 2026. To do that, we need to make big changes. Very different circuit. It__l be interesting to see where the car falls out this weekend. Melbourne and Shanghai, very different layouts _ lots of long corners around here. The tyres take a punishing around this track as well. Not much chance for the tyres to reset, to cool down. There are not long straights, well there are but they__e not as evenly spread out as in Australia. So yeah, I think it__l be a good test for us to see where the car is at. I mean, I don__ see it as much of a setback. I think Isack had a fantastic start to his Formula 1 career. The pace was surprisingly strong, actually, from all the rookies in Australia, considering how difficult that track is. I was surprised by how quickly they adapted. It__ been a good start for him, and I think he__ going to be someone we__e looking out for the rest of the year, for sure. Enjoy the process! Firstly, I__ trying to keep up with Stefano and asking him_ I think we__e going to meet up later. But it__ very exciting, clearly__or myself and for all of Formula 1, not just me. Thailand is an amazing country, and I__ sure people who have been to Thailand will vouch for that. I__ be excited to hopefully one day show my colleagues the culture of Thailand, the food_ It will be interesting with the heat__hat__ one area that might make it a Singapore 2.0. But all the more for it. On my side, I__ doing everything I can to make that happen. But let__ see. I think it__ very early to say how he__ going to do. I think, for everyone out there, the conditions and the general format of qualifying now make things very tight. Firstly, let__ start with the fact that qualifying is closer than ever, which is great for everyone. But it also means that if you__e just a little bit off, you__e likely going to be out in Q1. Then in the race, there__ not much to say. Everyone was struggling out there. I think, especially for the rookies and the ones with a little bit less experience, they were on the back foot for most of Sunday. So yeah, I think we need to give him a bit of time to get up to speed.",China,thursday,Williams
Isack Hadjar,"I would say by Monday, I already felt quite a lot better, especially knowing that it__ a back-to-back weekend. So I get to run it back quite early, not having a month to dwell on it. So, quite quickly, I__ say. I would say that we were surprisingly faster than we thought. Looking at Bahrain, of course, it's hard to really understand where you are because you don__ know how much everyone is hiding or not. But going into Melbourne, the car was really good, and straight from FP1, I had a really nice feeling with it. I was quite comfortable, and I was as close as I wanted to be. So I think there were a lot of positives in terms of pure performance. I mean, I know the track really well from the sim. It__ one of those tracks I__e been playing on since I was a kid _ on PS3, PS4, with a controller. So I know the track well, even though I__e never driven here. I__ quite excited about it. Yeah, let__ see. I would say, in terms of the approach, I__ quite used to it. The last three years, that__ what I__e been doing _ straight from FP to qualifying with only a few push laps. So the approach, I know how to get it right. But of course, I__ rather have three free practice sessions, for sure. I mean, I found it embarrassing myself. And, you know, Helmut__ had him on the phone a day later, and it__ all good. I mean, I__e known him for a few years now. I know how he works. Also, I think he said that in German and it was reinterpreted differently. You don__ always get the body language. I didn__ see the footage, so I can__ say much. But apart from that, yeah, I have to say the love from the fans and people, I did not expect that at all when I binned it in the wall. That was nice, yeah. Yeah, he said it reminded him of Lewis parking the car at pit entry in Shanghai. It was a nice moment, sharing time with someone like Anthony as well__bviously, the dad of my idol. So that was quite a special moment. And indeed, Lewis sent me a message later that day. Really classy guys.",China,thursday,RB
George Russell,"Yeah, it was a great race to come home in P3. I just want to say a massive well done to Lando. I think in a race like that, when you're leading, it's probably your worst nightmare. But he did a great job. Also, really well under Kimi to come back to P5, which is a really impressive first race. For us, it wasn't our strongest weekend, but to end up on the podium__uper happy. Yeah, let's see what we can do next week. Yeah, it was good fun. I was quite enjoying it, to be honest, because I was hoping the two guys ahead would make a mistake and I could slip through, but that just didn't seem to be the case today. Really tricky, but that's what F1's about, and that's what makes it exciting for us. I hope everyone enjoyed it at home. Yeah, absolutely. It's been, all things considered, a really good weekend. We know McLaren are out in front at the moment, but this was a strong result. Yeah, I think just staying out of trouble, to be honest. It was pretty clear from the beginning that these guys were too quick for us, and we were quicker than Ferrari. So, I was kind of in no man's land. I made a decision quite early on that the best way to approach this race was just to bring it home. If I risked it more, there was no extra reward on the table because they were just so far ahead. Very difficult. As Lando said, any small mistake and you'd be punished. But pleased to come home with this result because I don't think this is probably our strongest circuit. Especially after yesterday with the hot temperatures, I was also very happy with the P4 in quali. The process started this morning, to be honest. We had some really good conversations about how we were going to make these decisions, what they needed from me, what I needed from them. I knew the rain would be getting heavier, so it was down to me to make that decision. Similar to Lando, I made the call five seconds in advance, and the guys were ready to change the tyres. That was a key moment in the race. I__ really happy about it because these mixed-condition races__or both of us, to be honest__hey've gone away from us in the last couple of races. When we look at Brazil last year, we both got it wrong with strategy. Also in Montreal, it kind of went away from us as well. I think now, just to be here, is a good result. Yeah, I think it was fine. They look pretty good and groovy at the moment. So yeah, we__l see. What he said.",Australia,post-race,Mercedes
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, it was a difficult race, of course, but at the end, it was fun. Lando had a little moment on entry of six, so he lost a lot of momentum there. That's why I got close, and then I got DRS. I got close but it's very hard to pass around here. It was fun those last laps, you know, pushing at least, when you're fighting for the win. I'm just very happy to bring it home, score good points. This is, let's say, a decent starting point for us. Yeah, it started to rain a bit. They went off, so it was a bit like a panic. Like, ""Oh, I need to box."" So, they went. I stayed out the first time. Honestly, the first lap, I think it was alright. But then, unfortunately, the weather continued a little bit more on the other side of the track as well, and we had to box. At the end of the day, even if we had boxed one lap earlier, we would have still been P2 after that stop. I think it was worth the gamble. It was quite spicy out there with the slick tyres, but it was alright at the end. It is what I expected it to be. You can see also in that first stint, we were lacking a little bit of pace compared to McLaren, but it's still 18 points more than what I had here last year so I'll take that. No, not so much, to be honest. I just tried my best, tried to be close, tried to put a bit of pressure on, but it's very hard to pass around here. There was only one line. Even if I had gotten a run into whatever, Turn 9, you have to go onto the wet part, so you can't really do a lot. But at least it was close. It looked good on TV. Two more laps! We were on the Medium, and of course, you never know how that's going to work out. But I thought it was quite a sensible call with 15, 16, or 20 laps to go when the Safety Car came out. Then, of course, it started to rain. I saw them go off in front of me, kept it clean, and when I saw Oscar rejoining, I thought, ""Well, let's stay out,"" because it was only those three corners. The rest was still dry. When I continued, basically, the first two sectors were fine _ it was just if I could survive the final sector. I think that lap I did was okay. If there wasn't much more rain coming, I thought it could work. You also have to factor in that even if they caught me on an Inter, they__ have to box again for slicks, if it__ not going to rain anymore. So, it was fine. I thought, ""Yeah, we'll do another lap,"" but then, unfortunately, on that lap, the first sector was still okay-ish, but then in Sector 2, it started to rain a bit too much and we had to box. But in hindsight, it wouldn't have mattered. If I__ boxed with Lando, it would have been P2. If I__ boxed the next lap, it would have been P2. And the lap that I did box, I was also P2. So, we tried something else__t might have worked. In a way, it didn__ work, but we didn__ lose any position, so it__ fine. I think it's good compared to the teams behind us. But if you look at the first stint, we were quite a bit off. As soon as the tyres started to overheat, we had no chance. McLaren just took off. So, we still have a lot of work to do to fight for a win. But yeah, I__ happy that we are second here. It's basically one place better than we should have been. And it's 18 more points than I had last year at this race. Yeah, I thought it was fine. I mean, if you crash behind the safety car, you're really stupid. We'll try our best. I could see it coming. I was struggling with my tyres. It was similar to yesterday. Now, Intermediates are even more of a soft compound, so they are even more prone to overheating.  That__ where we _ and a lot of teams _ are struggling compared to McLaren. They__e simply doing a better job on that. That__ what we need to work on. No, it__ still shockingly bad. It__ always been. Yes. I mean, it__ all good, all good.",Australia,post-race,Red Bull
Lando Norris,"It was amazing, thank you. A tough race, especially with Max behind me. I was pushing. The last two laps were a little bit stressful: I'm not going to lie. But an amazing way to start the year. A tough one because we went off, made some big mistakes. I went through the gravel, a lot of damage. Just tricky conditions, but these are the ones that are enjoyable, fun, and unpredictable. This time, we got it right and ended up on top. So, I__ very happy. We got it wrong a lot last year, so I guess we learned from our mistakes. We lost out on Silverstone and Canada through a race like this. We've learned from our mistakes. I think it's still only Round 1 of 24, but dealing with the pressure, dealing with Max, dealing with Oscar behind me__ was pushing the whole way through. I could relax inside, but I wasn't relaxing from how much I was pushing. A tough one, so to not make too many mistakes, not to have a mistake that cost me anything. I guess I can take a little bit of credit for that. A tough, challenging race, but for McLaren, I need to give a big thanks because they've given me an amazing car, so I have to start with them. I don't know, just drive, I guess. Max was quick. I knew I had good pace, but I made one mistake in Turn 6, and he got within the DRS. The DRS around here is probably like a second or something. That allowed him to keep staying within that second and have a couple of little looks. I had to check my mirror a few more times than I would have liked, but I stayed calm, kept it together, and listened to Will, so that__ the most important thing. You would hope so. It is. My weekend's been amazing. From the get-go__rom FP1, FP2, FP3, quali, and now the race. It's not easy to put a weekend together like this, especially when I've got a lot of pressure from Max and Oscar because they're hungry, competitive, and want it just as badly. Stressful, but I know what I'm capable of. I know what I can do. But like you said, it's just Round 1, so we need to go and do it again next weekend and continue from there. A long season ahead__e just have to keep our heads down and keep pushing. Very, yeah. I mean, to start the season off with a win is good enough, but to do it in such a stressful race, where it's so easy to make a mistake, so easy to ruin everything, you know, so quickly, it can all go wrong within any second of the race _ you lock up, you hit the white line wrong, you have a big snap. It was just very difficult at times to not go into a wall or a tyre barrier somewhere. That's a big enough challenge, but then when you've got the weather changing and the track conditions changing, knowing when to make the correct decision to change onto a slick tyre or stay out on the Inter tyre, and then even more when I__e got Max behind me and Oscar behind me, it's stressful, but that's what makes it rewarding and such a nice win.
Yeah, difficult. A lot of tough moments. I guess that's what makes it sweeter. But, you know, we worked a lot over the winter to prepare for a race like this because it's where we threw away a lot of opportunities last season _ Canada, Silverstone _ where we were not the best at preparing and knowing how decisive we've got to be. And today we were very decisive. Calling to box five minutes before I boxed, but it was the right call in the end, and that won us the race. Stressful, but rewarding. Yeah, I mean, this is a tough one. Max was on the Mediums, myself and Oscar on the Hard. So, I think we knew if it started to rain, we'd struggle more than Max. At that time, we still didn't have all the temperature in the tyres. Also, being first, you just take the risks _ how much do I push it? You don't know if you have to_ You see some drizzles of rain on the visor, and I got a call from Will saying that it's drizzling a bit in the last sector. But you don't know if you have to slow down five kilometres an hour, 10, 11. If you slow down 11, maybe it's perfect; if you slow down 10, maybe you're off. Making those decisions two metres before you brake, it's not easy. You__e got to do a lot of things on the fly and just wing it. Obviously, I went in a bit quick for how much rain was coming down and I__e completely gone off. I__e managed to just about get it stopped for the corner, but I looked in my mirror as I was off and saw Oscar go through the gravel as well, and Max then catching. It__ a very stressful moment because it all could have gone wrong there. If I stayed on track, I think Max probably would have passed me because he was on the Medium and probably in a better window than I had with the Hards. But we boxed, and then half the track was completely dry, and half of it was wet _ kind of like a Spa kind of race. You don't know how much to push in the dry bit because you destroy the Inters quickly. I think that's why I struggled a bit at the end of the race _ my Inters were just a little destroyed from when it was still dry. A lot of things to factor in, so to get it all right and deal with the stress in a good way was very nice. It's great. Doesn't mean anything. I've not won it, so yeah, I don't really care at the minute. I do, but I think we'll have both. I think we'll have tracks where we will be even better, and I think we'll have a couple where we__l struggle. We were good last year, especially in the second half of the season, but Vegas was woeful. In fact, we were shocking. There are other tracks along those lines where we did struggle quite a bit. We've definitely made our car much more balanced across all types of circuits _ high speed, low speed, high downforce, low downforce. We__e competitive at most. But these low grip tracks like Vegas, we really struggled. It highlighted our issues with the front of the car _ the graining, the lack of rotation. We know that, though. We know where we're going to struggle. Even in Bahrain a couple of weeks ago, we came out confident, but everyone was hyping us up a lot. Mainly just because our high-fuel pace was very strong. But on low fuel, we were struggling. We were not as quick as some of the others. Even if we took all our fuel out and max the engine mode, I don't think we would have been quicker. We know we have work to do. If we raced in Bahrain again, I wouldn__ be confident we could win the race. But I__ confident that when we go to China next weekend, we can be very strong, because we were strong there last year with not a very good car. So, a mixture. But I hope not. Vegas was our worst last season, so I__ hoping we__l improve by then. I mean, like I said, we lost out on a few races last year. Not even ones where it was a guaranteed win, but I think Silverstone was probably a guaranteed win. I don__ know what call we made, but it was a shocking one and we accepted that. Canada wasn__ a guaranteed win. George was quick, Mercedes was quick, and Max was quick. But we didn__ nail the strategy. We knew we had to improve in certain areas. There__ been a lot of work on trying to make sure we're snappier and better with communication. To be honest, today, I wouldn't say it was snappy _ I felt like I was having story time with Will on the radio. We were talking so much every lap; I might as well have left my radio open the whole race. It__ a difficult situation being first and not knowing what to do with tyres. You just know someone behind will get it right behind you, because they__e going to gamble something, and it__l work out for them. I didn__ want to lose out to someone in the middle of the pack who gambled and somehow won. So, I was just making sure we were prepared. I was making sure the guys on the pit wall and everyone back in Mission Control at MTC were aware of what was going on. Making sure we were on top of it, ready to make the right call. That right call was made literally half a second before I boxed, as I was still trying to save the car and didn__ shunt. It turned out to be the right decision. It was more about relaying information and making sure we__e not overdoing it, a good amount of information__iving them my feelings. A little drizzle seemed to make a big difference for us today, especially for me on the hard tyres. That__ what allowed us to make that call to box as quickly as we did. There__ a lot more behind the scenes that even I don__ know. A lot of it is the strategy team doing their work. I owe them a lot of credit today because they__e put in a lot of time and effort over the winter. It__ not just about driving a car quickly on a day like today, strategy is a big part of it too. I owe a lot to Will and the strategy team today. I was comfortable. You shouldn't be in Formula 1 then. The thing is, I knew I was going to struggle a bit because I put the Inters on two laps before Max, and with half the track still being dry, I pushed. Even the high-speed was dry, so I kind of destroyed my tyres a little. The front tyres_ you could see the rubber was already rolling over on the edges. I knew my pace advantage wouldn__ be as much as at the beginning of the race. At the very beginning, when it was wettest, Max was just as quick as us. As it dried, we got a lot quicker, and Red Bull started to struggle. So, I knew Max would be quicker in those last few laps, and I knew he would risk more because there were only a few laps left. I did make a mistake at Turn 6 _ I just put a wheel on the gravel and lost all my momentum and drive. Max got within DRS, and DRS really helped him stay there. It's tough because it's not just the pressure of him being there, it__ the pressure of knowing that if I put a wheel too close to a white line on entry, I__ off. If I clip the kerb wrong in Turn 6, I__ off. If I dip a wheel in the gravel, I get a bad run and he's past. There are so many little things that can go wrong. Just trying to concentrate on not locking up, not rear locking, not hitting the kerbs wrong, but still trying to go quicker than before because the guy behind is doing the same. It was stressful. I'm not going to lie. I was checking my mirrors a lot. Even Will came on the radio and told me to chill out a bit. He knows, and Jarv, my performance engineer, knows very quickly from my driving when I__ pushing too much or when I__ pushing the entries too much. They're quick to jump in and say, ""Do this better"" or ""Watch out for that"" because they know what I struggle with. Especially in a situation like that. That situation was new for me. I__e never led a race with five laps to go with Max behind me, trying to put me under pressure, in these conditions. Maybe Max has had that a few times _ he__ raced against Lewis a lot and can deal with it better than I can. For me, it was a first. So, it was about seeing how I handled it when I got there. I'm happy I got through it and stayed calm. It__ something I improved from last year. Let__ see. Max was three-tenths off yesterday. Last year, we were much further off and ended up with the best car by the end of the season. We were over half a second off at the beginning of last year behind Red Bull and ended up with the quickest car. I know George made some comments earlier this weekend that they can just turn our focus to 2026. If that__ their mentality, wonderful, but that__ not the mentality to have. Sorry, mate. We know we still have a lot of work to do on this year__ car. If you relax in this position, you fail. In Formula 1, if you start thinking things are good and groovy, that__ when you get caught. I do think we're favourites because the team has done an amazing job, and the car is flying. But we will have races where we struggle. If we started the season in Bahrain, I don__ think we would have won, and you wouldn't be asking me this question. Let__ allow a few more races to take place before making any obvious statements. But we are the team to beat, mainly because we have two drivers up there pushing each other. That helps. Do I think me and Oscar pushing each other in qualifying yesterday allowed us to get one and a half, one tenth more than the two drivers here because their team-mates aren__ as equipped or experienced. Yes, so add that into the equation as well. It__ not just about the car. The team has done an amazing job, and I thank them for everything they__e doing. But we know we can make it better, and that__ our aim. That__ for us. That__ not something I need to share. The team works very hard to improve. Strategy engineers, mechanics. I don__ need to say these things to the media. I let them do their job. It__ the same as when I work hard to improve in areas I do. Some things I say, some I don__. People spend a lot of time, they dedicate their lives to this. I__ not going to give away how people work and improve to be the best in their sport or job.",Australia,post-race,McLaren
Lando Norris,"Good enough, I guess. Tricky because of my first lap and going off track. And just with how tight it's been, especially with Oscar. But yeah, it's a tough one because you want to take a lot of risks, especially on this track. It__ a track where you__e got to commit. You know what your target is, and once you turn in you're kind of hoping for the best in a lot of cases. You want to take those risks. Obviously, I took too many on my first lap and got track limits, so I was in a difficult position knowing how much risk I wanted to take. But I put it together well, it was just a clean lap, no mistakes, and that was enough. So happy. A perfect way to start the season. I mean, we've been confident just because our expectation is_ As much as we want to dominate and actually have a result like we've just had, it really was not necessarily our expectation to have a bit of a gap to the rest of the cars. And when I say gap, I mean when we put the lap in, we had a bit of a gap, but it's been difficult. I think one of our struggles has been how difficult it's been in our car just to execute those qualifying laps and put things together. That's been something I've struggled with this weekend. So to have the kind of pace we had today was not unexpected, but we just weren__ going in thinking, ""OK, we're going to have two-tenths over everyone or one and a half-tenths."" We know we have a good car, mainly because I know I have a very good team around me and everyone back at McLaren and MTC has done an incredible job to keep the car going from last season and improving. I think it's good. We were decent in Bahrain and I think we're going to expect to be pretty good here. We were pretty good here last year, and that was with a much worse car. We're going in with one target, which is to be at the top and to have two cars at the top. But conditions are going to be unexpected, so we just have to go in prepared. That__ all we can really do. Win. The same. It doesn__ change. It's very tough. I mean, it's so cool, but it's a sketchy track because you've got walls close and you can't make a lot of mistakes around here. You pay the price very quickly. It's a street circuit, and you have a lot of these painted white lines, which may be high grip, but they're still very slippery when you're going at speed. We did some wet running a couple of years ago. It tests you. So excited, yes. Nervous at the same time. But we know we have a good car, and we just have to keep our heads down. I mean, after today, you__ say it__ usable, but it has been our struggle so far this_ I can't say season _ the first test and here. I think it's what happens when you__e getting to that boundary. It__ another year of the same regulations, and you__e trying to improve everything. You've got to weigh it up__o you want a bit more load, or do you want to make it more drivable? It's a difficult balance to get, especially at this kind of point, when there__ a lot of competition and you're trying to find everything possible. There's no easy gains. There__ always a pro and a con to everything. It might be that it's a bit more in that direction, but we__e at least been able to improve the car a good chunk. I__ say it__ quicker, maybe a little tricky to drive, but then it__ down to us. It__ my job to be under that limit and find the correct limits without going over them. You can__ always have a perfect car. Good drivers are the ones who can drive a difficult car and deal with whatever they get given. Of course, you always prefer a quick one, but this is the price we pay for pushing those boundaries that we__e doing as McLaren. I don__ know. For me, we just have to wait and see. Also, it__ a new car, so there are a lot of unknowns and question marks about how it will perform. It__ not always as simple as just putting on wets and having a crack. We__l wait and see. Of course, it__ always more unknown, more possibilities for everyone. A bit of our pace potentially goes out of the window because it's harder to extract and show the difference of pace we had today. But we're in the best position to do that if we can. I know the chances of rain have been going down, but normally wet races and inter races are pretty exciting, especially for you guys. I__ excited to see what we can do, but there are a lot of question marks and not too many answers for the time being. Oscar does a really good Andrea accent, so maybe he wants to say it from Andrea__ point of view. Or maybe in a Zak accent! There have obviously been discussions because_ We__e prepared because we know we__e going to have more of this kind of thing over the season. There are clearly rules we cannot cross. Both cars must always stay in the race, but we__e both competitors. That__ clear. We both want to fight for a win and victories. But there are boundaries around the car__ust a little more space here and there. We__e free to race, free to try and win races. But what won us the Constructors_ last year was how we helped one another and how we kept things clean. How there was order when there needed to be. A lot of that was later in the season when external things were happening. Right now, there__ none of that. So we__e both excited. Of course, we__l have our morning talks, but that__ normal. I__ pretty sad, actually. Yeah, I__ say it__ bittersweet because I__ the kind of guy who doesn__ want to upset people. But it__ my job, and it__ what I get paid to do. It__ what__ written in my contract and I have to go out and drive as quick as I can. It__ difficult because every country backs their drivers. It__ the same for Max in Zandvoort and Spa, Austria _ all of those ones. And it__ the same for me at Silverstone. And Belgium actually, I__l claim that one! And therefore, kind of the Netherlands too. At the end of the day, my job is to drive as quickly as I can. If that__ pole, then that__ pole. I__ happy I did my job. But I do want to make it out of Australia safely! The fans have always been very supportive of me too. I__e had an Australian team-mate for quite a while now, so I__e got used to it. They do cheer me on as well. I know they cheer Oscar on a lot more, but that__ expected and I appreciate the support I do get. I mean, I expected more. They__e been just as quick as us all weekend. We definitely came into qualifying expecting a fight with Ferrari, although Max was not far behind, as he said, he was a bit surprised to be up here. I think we expected more from Ferrari. People are quick to judge, __h he__ there on the timesheets, they__e slower, the car isn__ good_. But it__ difficult out there to put a lap together. When you see how close one tenth can be it can easily be three or four positions. A tenth is easily within most drivers every lap, especially on a track like this. It__ about commitment, pushing that little more on the final lap, getting off the brakes, committing to corners, pushing track limits. There__ a tenth in most people. Sometimes two-tenths in taking those risks. I felt I still took a good amount of risks in the final lap to get pole. But I did expect Ferrari to be quicker. Whether that__ because they didn__ put good laps in or struggled more with the car, I don__ know. You__ have to ask them. We all expected Ferrari to be quicker because they have been just as quick as us all weekend. So it__ more that they just didn__ perform in qualifying for whatever reason.",Australia,post-qualifying,McLaren
Oscar Piastri,"It was pretty good. I was happy with it. This weekend I've been happy with the laps we've been putting in and how I have been executing them apart from the first lap of Q3. But apart from that, I've been happy with how I've driven. I think the last lap, there__ nothing I__ majorly kicking myself about. The gap is very tight, obviously, and I just needed that little bit more. Yeah, I went a bit deep into Turn 11. With these tyres, with the hot temperature, as soon as you slide them a little bit or get them dirty, they drop off a lot. I struggled a lot with the last sector and then went off at the second-last corner. That__ the fine line around here. I think that's been a little bit of a struggle with our car so far__t__ been quick, but it bites at times. I'm pretty happy with the job I did, and I'll go back and see where it could have been a little bit better. Pretty happy. Yesterday felt quite good. If it's dry, then I think we're in a good place. If it's wet, it's very difficult to tell__retty much what Lando described. There are a lot of places that can catch you out here. There are a few corners that in the dry are not corners, that are very much corners in the rain. It becomes a fair bit trickier. And then you've got white lines everywhere, with it obviously being a road circuit. We're pretty confident for tomorrow. Yeah, I am. I think this is the most relaxed I've been at my home race. The first two years, especially the first year I came here, it was an overwhelming experience. Even last year, it was still a pretty big experience. This year, I__e been able to enjoy it more. Maybe because I__ more confident in the car under me, but I've really been enjoying it and enjoying the support. I feel like it's gone up a little since last year as well. It__ amazing what happens when you start winning stuff. No, it's great to have all the home support, and I really appreciate it. Yeah, very much the same. This weekend it's been difficult at points, but nothing unmanageable or unfixable. It looked pretty tricky out there for everybody. I think as we're pushing the limits of these tyres, I think for a while now they__e been pretty sensitive to how much load all the cars are putting through them. It__ not as easy as you__ like, but the underlying pace is definitely there, as shown. Yeah, more or less the same thing. We had a few wet laps here a couple of years ago, so we__e all done some running on this new layout. But the cars have moved on a lot since then. I can't even remember if the tyres are the same anymore. Might be. So there are a lot of unknowns for tomorrow. And with this being round one, like Lando said, there are still some question marks about whether some of the characteristics we had in the past are still the same when it rains. I wouldn't say I__ disappointed because I feel like I did a job I__ happy with. If I was sitting here thinking, ""I had another two-tenths in hand, and I blew it,"" then I__ be pretty upset. But I feel like I've executed well this weekend. That__ all I can ask of myself. There are always things to improve and do better, and I'll try to look at those, but ultimately, I__ happy with how I__e driven this weekend. In terms of pressure, honestly, I said in the lead-up that I was using it as support and not pressure, and that__ genuinely been the case. Of course, you want to start the season well and do well at home, those things are obvious, but I think I__e done a good job of being strong and not letting that get in my head. I__ happy with how I__e approached the weekend, how I__e driven, and the support has been really special. The expectation is very minor compared to the support. I assume you mean first front row in Melbourne, because we had a front row last race. It would be really special to achieve. I__ not setting my sights too firmly on that, obviously. We've got a lot of work to do to maximise the race tomorrow and see what the weather does first. But it would be very special. I don't really have another way of answering that__t would mean a lot. To have an Aussie on the podium, it hasn__ been done in a while, so that would be a good start. If I can stand on the top step, I__l do everything I can to achieve that. Putting national pride aside, I want to do it for myself as well. I__l try my best, obviously. Yeah, I think the only Andrea accent I can do is about some of the innovative things on our car that everyone__ obviously seen now! We__e free to race each other. I want to win as much as Lando does. He summed it up well. I think in any team, not just McLaren, the number one rule is no contact. We must give each other space. If there are opportunities for either of us to take advantage of situations, we will. But ultimately, we are racing for the team. That__ important. We__e said many times that the teamwork we showed last year helped us win the Constructors_. It__ important to recognise that fact. The car has been strong for a while, but also the team is very strong too. That__ as good as I can put it. Yeah, I think the same. Going into qualifying, we expected Ferrari to be our biggest challenge. In FP3, any one of the top four teams looked like they could challenge. I don__ know, maybe we just took more sandbags out than everyone else! I don__ know. I was pleasantly surprised by the pace we had in qualifying. Maybe surprised by some other teams, namely Ferrari. But it__ only one session. Obviously, the headline now is probably going to be ""McLaren is by far the quickest,"" but I think it will change a lot over the next few races. If we don__ know who will be quickest, I don__ know how anyone else can. It__ going to be a good fight. I expect Ferrari to be fast and competitive through the year.",Australia,post-qualifying,McLaren
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, I think so. We had a bit of a tough start. This has never really been a good track for us. So it took a bit of time to understand how we could improve the situation. We did that today. Honestly, I__ quite surprised to be sitting here after yesterday. I felt confident, I felt one with the car, but clearly, we were lacking a bit of pace. Overall, I__ happy with the laps in qualifying. I tried to really extract everything. The tyres are quite sensitive around here, with all these high-speed corners, but I__ happy to be here. Yeah, just trying to fine-tune the balance. The car came alive a little more. Yesterday it was, in general, quite OK to drive, just too slow. Today it was a little faster. But clearly still not fast enough. Still, to be ahead of Ferrari and Mercedes here is good for us. I don__ expect miracles, but I think it__ OK. Not on the same level, but I__l just do my best and see what happens tomorrow. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it__l be slippery in the wet! So you have to take that into consideration.",Australia,post-qualifying,Red Bull
Max Verstappen,"Yeah, all good. What kind of shape? Positive shape I guess. I don't know. Guess we'll find out more this weekend and after it. Yeah, we__l try to do our best. I mean, there's not really much more that we can do, You know, testing isn__ many days. So we found, already, a few areas that we can work on and that's what we'll continue to do so. Yeah, I think naturally there is an improvement, but I think I've said it before: there are still things that we want to improve on and do better now. This is of course also a different track to Bahrain. So yeah, that already will feel a bit different to drive the car here. But yeah, step by step. Impossible to know at the moment. I mean, I know that we are not the quickest at the moment, but again, it's a very long season. If you would have asked that question here last year and then at the end of the season again, you know it looked completely different. So a lot of things can always change quite quickly in Formula One. Yeah, there's a lot of things that you make me think about that I actually don't think about. So it's actually way more relaxing to just go into it, trust the people around you, and go from there. You know, work hard on and off track, try to address things that you don't like in a car or whatever, and always try to do the best on track yourself. Try to minimize mistakes and keep scoring points. I don't know. I don't think about it. There's no reason to think about that yet. Exactly that. Yeah, yeah. I mean, you answered it for yourself. Yeah, it__ a long time ago now. No, it__ great to see. I mean, in general, it__ nice that there are so many_ I__ allowed to say rookies, right? I guess that__ still up for debate__ut young drivers getting into Formula One. And of course, I__ hoping they stay for a long time. The excitement, also the unknown at the same time, is good. It__ fun to see from my side as well. From the Red Bull pool, seeing young drivers finally getting these opportunities is great. I__ excited to see how they will perform throughout the year and in the coming years. Yeah, I mean, we__l do our best to make it as competitive as possible. Of course, it__ the final year of these regulations, so I guess up to a certain point__nd I don__ know where that is__ou focus on this year, and then at some point, you focus on a whole different thing. We__l make it more drivable, but Bahrain is very different to what we have here, so it's a bit difficult to say if things have been fully fixed or not. I guess we just have to be patient and see how much we can regain. Yeah, I mean it's great for Formula 1. He's first of all a great person as well. I got along very well with Stefano as well, so I'm very happy that you know he's staying around for a longer period of time. I'm not surprised, so_ I didn't watch it. It's just unfortunate you see these things pop up on X, but you just need to quickly ignore it so it doesn't come up again in your feed. No, not blocked, because they see that. If you ignore it, then no one knows. No, nothing to be honest. It's important to make your mistakes and of course feel that excitement at the time, because if I would have told him at the time what he would achieve in the sport then it's pretty boring to know what's ahead, right? You need to have that uncertainty. You need to feel the pressure of having to perform at the time, trying to work your way into a top team. All these kind of things. So, no, nothing. No, I mean actually I was like it to be dry because it's just nicer. Also, for the fans. But if it's wet, it's wet. It's fine as well, but I don't know how we will perform in in the dry or the wet at the moment, you know, so it's a bit a bit difficult to say. I would like my child to choose themselves. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Mean, of course. If he or she wants it, then you will always do you're very best as a parent, you know to provide everything they need or advice. But I'm also very happy if they, you know, would choose something else, to be honest. Brilliant. So. nothing to add. Yeah, I mean that would actually_ You want to sign a contract? You're good at it. Can just make a little side letter.",Australia,thursday,Red Bull
Oscar Piastri,"I don't know. We'll see. I know what you want me to say, and everyone's headline can be that, but we'll see. I think, you know, obviously no one really knows what to expect. Testing went pretty well, but you don't know where everybody stands. I think we're pretty happy with how our test went, but as we've said, Melbourne is a completely different track to Bahrain. Weather is going to be different to Bahrain and different every hour, by the look of it. So it's going to be an interesting weekend for sure, but I think hopefully we're expecting to be somewhere up the front. Whether that's right at the pointy end, we__l wait until Saturday, I think. I mean, it was from both sides, really. I was already signed up for this year and the next, but it felt like just a very natural progression to sign for an even longer term. Obviously, last year was an incredible year for the team. I think my two years at the team have been pretty incredible__tarting from where we were when I joined to being Constructors' champions now. It made a lot of sense in my mind to try and continue that and build with the team. Obviously, myself and Lando are both there for a long time now. Andrea is on a long-term contract, Zak, the key technical staff as well. So yeah, for me, it seemed like a no-brainer, and I think it was reciprocated from the team as well. I haven't watched it, to be honest. I feel like I have a pretty good idea of what happens, so I don't need to watch it again on TV. No, I mean, obviously there's a lot of things in Drive to Survive that, you know, we never quite know how it's been cut up. But no, I think for myself, I'm very confident in what I can do. We're going into the season starting from zero for both of us, and we're both obviously going to be trying to fight for a world championship. So yeah, I'm pretty confident in what I can do and aware that there are things that I need to do better from last season. But I'm confident that we've done a lot of hard work to try and improve that and go out and have a good year. No, I don't think so. Obviously, that would be ideal__o try and have that level of success and competitiveness. I think that__ what every team dreams of and what every driver dreams of. But at this point in the regulations, with how last season went, expecting that is incredibly naive. I think this season is going to be just as tight, if not even tighter, than the second half of last year especially. So yeah, of course, that__ what we want to aim for, but we have a new set of rules coming next year, and that's probably going to change the pecking order quite a bit__r at least the gaps quite a bit. So I don't think it's the same circumstances. But also, I think this year is going to be an incredibly competitive year of F1. As much as I would like to try and have that level of success, I think it's going to be very, very tough. When I signed my contract again yesterday! No, I think you're constantly learning. Even now, two years in, there are still things you always learn and improve. I__ sure if you ask Lewis and Fernando, it's still the same, however many decades later. I think after the first race or the first couple of races, you start to feel a bit more comfortable. A home race is a tough circumstance for a second race, but once you get some of those big milestones out of the way and have a few good results on the board, that always helps with the nerves as well. Yeah. I mean, we're starting from a clean slate, and ultimately, whoever's going to be faster on track is going to be the one who wins and finishes higher. So yeah, we__e very much clear on how we__e going into the season, and that__ racing each other and trying to hopefully fight for wins. It__ all very clear. We've discussed a lot from last season and how we managed the back end of last year. And I think this year, starting from zero again, we__e both going to be trying our best to win. Yeah, I__ like to think both of them! To get in early, the Ashes aren__ even going to be a contest, Crofty. I was going to say same result as last time, but the trophy is staying in the same place. For the season, obviously, I__ confident in what I can do as a driver. Last year, I proved to myself over a decent portion of the year what I__ capable of, and I really took confidence from especially the wins and some of the better races. Now, it__ just about trying to do that every race weekend__hat's the goal. With Lando, it__ obvious that he__ incredibly talented, and it__ never going to be easy going up against him. But yeah, I__ confident in my own ability to try and prevail this year. Yeah, I think the advice would be just to enjoy it mainly. You only get to make your home race debut once. And you know, it's a busy week. A busy weekend. It's busier than everywhere else and I think you know, for me, as much as you try to say it's another weekend, it's not. It__ a bit different. So I think just mainly enjoying it. For me, it hit pretty hard the first time here, especially growing up 15 minutes down the road, that was pretty special. But I think the advice is just to enjoy it, the first time round, every time round. But yeah, just soak it all in and you know, remember that you only get to do it once and it's pretty special to be able to race home. Yeah, very much the same. I think what he__ been able to help with the sport has been very appreciated. You know, his door is always open to us as drivers. And again very easy to talk to very receptive of our ideas and concerns if we have any. So yeah, very happy that he's sticking around for a long time. I think it's a combination of all of those things. You know, in in some races the strategy is more important than others. I think always, you know, being intelligent with how you drive and ultimately being fast usually makes the strategy a bit more. If you can do that. But you know, that's why we have a team of hundreds of people back at the factory. Obviously they're not all doing strategy and stuff like that, but it's why you have those teams to give you every chance of success out on track so. A combination of all the things you know, obviously as a driver in the seat, you're probably the best person to read the situation from the car in terms of you know what the tyres are doing, what the car's doing. But the strategy team will see a lot more of the race picture and what's going on around you so a bit of column A and a bit of column B. If you pay. A fee I can do all your answers. Yep. I mean, it's always nice to have a fellow Aussie on the grid and you know, I think Jack very much deserves it. Think he had a lot of success in his junior career. I know the challenges he's probably had in the last year of sitting on the sidelines. So, you know, I know it's never an easy thing to come back into a race seat again when you've spent so much time out of a seat. You know, I think having time to get back into the swing of things and you're not just jumping in back in any race car, you're jumping in an F1 car, so I think time is going to be an important thing and trying to learn. But yeah, it's always great to have another Aussie and I think Jack has proved through his junior career that he deserves a chance. Yeah. It's nice to see him here. I mean, I think just the experience from both of them. I think the first time round watching the carnage unfold was a pretty good strategy that year, but last year, I think it was a pretty solid race. Some things to work on, but I think it's the same with every race. There's going to be parts from every single race I've done that you can transfer into your next race. Doesn't have to just be from Melbourne, but I think, you know, looking back at qualifying last year, the race last year, you pick up on some of the specifics and ultimately we've got to see what our competitiveness is like. We obviously hope it's good, but that is going to dictate a lot of the weekend and what you're fighting for. But I think yeah, being here for the third time now, obviously you know the track a lot better. You know some of the things to look out for in terms of the strategy, how to drive the car in the race. One thing you can never count out is Melbourne weather, though, so whether that's going to be relevant at all, we'll see. But. Yeah, I think you always gain experience from every race that you can just transfer into the next. So, nothing too crazy, but yeah, definitely in better stead than I was the first time I came here two years.",Australia,thursday,McLaren
Lewis Hamilton,"Good afternoon. It's good to see everybody. Yeah, naturally, I'm very, very fortunate. I've had this amazing career here in Formula 1. Starting with McLaren here in 2007 was an epic feeling. And then starting with a new team again with Mercedes was, again, incredible. I think this is very reminiscent of my first year. Over the years, I've gone up and down the paddock looking at the red garage, and now I'm actually in the red garage. So it's a really nice feeling. Yeah, so far, I definitely feel so. We've only had three days in the car, but it's difficult to know where we stand with everyone else. We're just trying to keep our heads down and focus on our job. Carlos was incredibly quick. Kimi was really quick. It was difficult to know who's where, but it looks like it's going to be close. For me, I__ itching to get going. It's been a long time coming, and to think that this is going to be my first Grand Prix__ne of those other firsts with the team__s I experience that all through the year, it's pretty special. I feel very honoured and very grateful to have the opportunity. Yeah. The first reason I was smiling was just looking at this youngster here. I__ happy for him, you know, he__ doing so well and conducting himself so well. Taking that first leap, getting that first opportunity to be in Formula 1, it's so, so special. I know how many years of dedication it would have taken for him. Starting even younger than I did. You__e 18 now, yeah? It__ just exciting to see. As for me, I don__ really approach this role with pressure. I think over the years, the pressure I put on myself has always been ten times higher than any other pressure that could be put upon me. I haven't joined this team and been made to feel any pressure. I have an expectation for myself__ know what I can bring, I know what I can deliver, and I know what it__ going to take. It__ just about getting my head down and working away. I come with a very open mind, coming into this weekend. It__ about getting into a good rhythm. I__ still learning this new car that__ quite a lot different from what I__e driven my whole career, in the sense of the Mercedes power coming to the Ferrari power, it__ something quite new _ different vibration, different feel, different way of working. The whole team works completely differently. I was just sitting looking at last year__ race traces and it__ upside down compared to the previous ones, what I__e been used to. I don't understand it all. You__e looking at things from a different perspective and that makes it exciting and challenging. This is definitely the most exciting period of my life. I__ really enjoying it, and I__ so excited to get in the car tomorrow. Carlos answered it well. I was kind of following him thinking he was taking the words right out of my mouth. As he said, joining a new team, the sooner you can reach a high level and get results, the better. But inevitably, there's a transition period, and there is a foundation that__ needed to be built. I__ sure both of us that__ what we have been doing over the past couple of months. The first half of the season, it is about that foundation building those relationships, the trust, you__e building with absolutely every everyone in the team. It__ not Trust isn__ something you just walk in the door and have__t__ built over time. For me, the goal is to win, of course, and to take the team forward. I__e had some not-so-spectacular years and I__ trying to see if I can have a better year than I have the last three. There__l are a lot of factors that can add to that. Yeah, well, definitely hope to be in the top 10. I think, well, I mean, I don't remember where I finished here last time? You guys won, I don't think it was that great. No, I didn't. I know you won. Yeah, what would I be happy with coming away this weekend? I don't know. As I said, I don't have expectations. I think I just ultimately want to come away knowing that I've given absolutely everything, and I've excelled in in the way that I know I can, that I felt comfortable in the car and just one foot in front of the other. So I don't know what that means in results. But of course, we won't know till tomorrow where whereabouts we truly stand with within the top teams. But I'm hoping that we're able to compete for the top five, so somewhere in that space. So, say that again. Sorry. I didn't know that. I really didn't know that. So that's something new for me. I have not met any Italians here, I don't think so. I__e been coming here a long time. No, I haven't been. I didn't even know that, but that's really cool to know, I guess. I mean, Italians are everywhere, right? They're everywhere you go, you got the cultures. Everywhere. Everyone loves pasta, everyone loves pizza, everyone knows about that, and everyone's seen the movies growing up. So I just feel like Italians are everywhere. But as I said, coming to Australia for me, I kind of I done the other, only other culture I really knew of the Aborigines, and as I've met some of the kids that have come to the track over the past years. So yeah, I guess now I'll get to see some of the so now I know when I see some of the people that are in red, they're actually Australian Italians, it's good to know. Well, obviously you know I__e got the worst memory, but I do know looking back that like when I was 22 years old, I wasn't obviously mature. I obviously had done all the homework in terms of how to drive a car, and I had the natural ability, but I didn't have a lot of foundation around me. I didn't have a team around me. It was my dad and my stepmom was booking my flights to come out here to they're here this weekend, so it's been a long journey with them. But I didn't have any help with prepping for something like this. It was just deep end everywhere I was, and I drowned many a times, as opposed to now, obviously, I'm very comfortable in my skin. I know who I am. I know where I'm going. I know what energy and time and effort I need to put in to get there. And obviously when I was 22 I didn't know that, but what a roller coaster ride it's been up until now and I'm just incredibly grateful to still be here, to still have an opportunity. Something that's been blowing my mind just recently is the fact that out of 8 billion people, there's only 20 drivers in Formula 1, and we're one of those drivers. It's such a privilege to be here and have this opportunity to do what we do year on year. It's absolutely phenomenal, and it's great to see it grow. It's great to see the audience grow. To see the sport moving in the right direction, having Stefano just resigned, thank God he's staying, because it's good to have a neutral, good leader at the forefront of the helm. And yeah, I'll stop there. I didn't really understand the questions. Be nice, but I think Carlos probably answered it. Copy Paste, yeah. He said it pretty well. I can't really say much more to them. Beside his great hair? His eyes. I mean, he's a good looking lad, you know! What surprised me most? Well, I would say, I would say work ethic. It's been really, really good. I didn't know, naturally, you don't know what happens behind closed doors. Naturally, I think every driver works really hard, but everyone has a different method in how they achieve their ultimate performance. And it's been really interesting to see. It__ not too dissimilar to mine, and you just see a hard working kid just getting on with it. He's obviously been in the team a long time. It's his second team. Obviously the team he was with before it was relatively short there, and then he's had this amazing time at Ferrari. And so he is. He's very, very, very much Mr Ferrari, and it's been really cool to work alongside him. And I'm really looking forward to working alongside him for the year. I don't really get in a competitive, competitive like mindset with it. It's more, I think, just remembering, and as I said, I remember when I first started, I remember the excitement. I remember being on track. Maybe, I don't know if this going to be the same for Kimi, but maybe for one of them. But I remember being on track with Michael Schumacher back in the day, and he being ahead of me, and I'm like, __h my God, that's Michael Schumacher_, and I just followed him for lap as many laps till he came in, basically, and, and it's a very, very_ it's just, it's very surreal. It's very hard to believe it's true what you're seeing, because you're growing up every day, every weekend, you know, make a bacon sarnie, and sit and watch the Grand Prix come on and watch him have that success. So I think when I'm looking at the youngsters coming through, I think I always really do try and want to make sure that I'm trying to set a good example in what I do and kind of look at them and I want to protect them from all the incoming bombardment that they will experience, because it can be a cruel world and they just need time. The pressure is, it takes a long time to create diamonds. Diamonds created over time. And I think just I hope that they have time and space to grow and be themselves and not have to conform and not have to rush. You've obviously some drivers come in and then get booted out straight away. I hope they're just given leeway and time to make mistakes, because that's what we've all made so many mistakes in our lives, and it's just that we do it in front of the world, and that's a really difficult space to do it, so I hope that you can all go easy on the youngsters and if anything, just take it out on us older guys. I'm not, because I'm not really. I don't really read the news, and I don't really_ I go for long, long periods of time without social media. So I'm not like being bombarded with all the stuff that's on social media. So I'm kind of living in my own little bubble in my head. For me, I'm back at kind of square one. I'm really just putting all the time I have in. I've been at the factory, like four days a week. I've been given absolutely everything to training, to push my mind and my body further than I have before, trying to see if I can excel, and just squeeze more juice out of this, that I have, and I__ under no assumptions that it will be easy. It is not. But I don't feel the pressure, just like the outside pressure is just nonexistent for me. The pressure is from within, and what I want to achieve, I'm not here to prove anything to anybody. I don't feel I have to do anything. I've been here a long, long time and done it time and time again. So I think for now, it's more I know, as I said, I know what it takes to do a good job, and that's what I want to deliver for myself, for myself and for my family, for this team that that I really believe deserve success. And I can see, like Carlos is experiencing in his new team, just when you see such a group, large group of people that are clearly so passionate and driven and maybe have not had as much success as they would like, more than they deserve. You just want to work towards and contribute to doing that.",Australia,thursday,Ferrari
Carlos Sainz,"Yeah, it's definitely been a positive start. I think, as I've said many times now, the positive start began in the Abu Dhabi test. As soon as I jumped into the car and started working with the people I was going to work with this year, I felt I had just joined a team full of motivation__ull of people wanting to bring this team back to the front. The car also didn__ disappoint me. It was a good test overall in Abu Dhabi, and we've had a strong winter in development. We've tried to hit the ground running this year, and we've had a positive test. Having said that, what you call positive__re we going to be half a second, one second off the leaders, I don't know. But hopefully, we can show progress. I think that's the fundamental word for us this year: keep showing progress as a team and see where we end up. I hope not, but in this sport, you never know. I'm definitely going to do my best to score them as soon as possible, but I don't know when that's going to be. That statistic isn__ the most important. As I said, progress means being more competitive, fixing the things we didn__ get right last year. So far, testing has been positive__eliability, weight of the car, just simple things that maybe in the past, Williams wasn't getting spot on. This year, it__ been the case, and that's exactly what I mean by progress. Happy faces, happy people. I see people full of motivation and that's what I care about the most because that's what's going to sustain medium to long-term success. Yeah, I think I summarised it before. Keeping showing progress and keep building momentum as a team. Personally, adapting fast to the team would be success because a new year in a new team it always takes time to adapt to the car, to the team and making that adaptation process as short as possible is one of the biggest challenges. If I manage to do that quickly, I__l be proud of it. In terms of results, I prefer to wait for two or three races, analyse where the car is, what am I going to be fighting for and once I see if I am going to be fighting for Q2s or Q3s, points, no points, then I put together whatever a good season would be and I would start targeting those results.  But before knowing where the car is going to be, it__ almost impossible to set targets in terms of number if points, position in the championship and all that. Again, it's very difficult to answer this question. I think even after FP2, I would be able to tell you more in detail what I would be happy with, because that's where you start to understand whether you are fifth team, eighth team or 10th team or seventh. And then you set yourself expectations, for quali and for the race, but without knowing it's like, I don't know, maybe top 10, it could be a good result, but you might not be even close to the top 10, or top 10 might not be optimistic enough. So you need to readapt the expectation, so I don't know, maybe after FP2, give me a session to see where everyone is, and I tell you what I would be happy with. But yeah, the win of last year, I don't think it's very is very likely. You didn't win. Inspiration, you said? I think Charles has been doing a great job in representing the Ferrari colours, the Ferrari brand, the last how many years? Six or seven years of his career. I think no one needs to talk about his talent and his speed, everyone knows that. But in terms of how he behaves, how he treats everyone in the team, how he takes the Ferrari brand all around the world, I think he's doing an incredible job, and he's part of that team growth that Ferrari has seen recently. And I think, yeah, in that Ferrari has a great ambassador also, Good on him. Good job. I think he's been doing that, and he's been progressive, progressing both as a driver, but also as a human being all these years. And he's now probably in one of the sweetest spots of his career. He feels mature, comfortable, and probably ready to win. So let's see what they can do here.",Australia,thursday,Williams
